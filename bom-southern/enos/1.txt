Well now, it happened that I, Enos, knew my daddy was a good man—he taught me his words, along with the ways of the Lord—bless his name for that—
Let me tell y’all 'bout the fight I had with God before I got a clean slate on my sins.
So, I went huntin' critters in the woods, and all them words I heard from my daddy 'bout eternal life and what joy the good folks got really sank into my heart.
I was downright hungry in my soul; I knelt down before my Maker, cryin’ out for my own soul in a powerful prayer, and I spent the whole day hollerin' out to Him; come nightfall, I still lifted my voice high enough to reach the heavens.
And then, I heard a voice sayin' to me: Enos, your sins are gone, and you gonna be blessed.
And I, Enos, knew that God ain’t no liar; so my guilt was all cleaned out.
I asked, “Lord, how's that work?”
And He told me: 'Cause of your faith in Christ, whom you've never laid eyes on before. There’ll be many years pass by before He shows up in the flesh; so get on with it, your faith has made you whole.
Now, right then, when I heard these words, I started feelin’ a real deep desire for the well-being of my folks, the Nephites; so I laid out my whole soul to God for 'em.
And while I was out there wrestlin' in the spirit, lo and behold, the voice of the Lord came back to my mind and said: I’ll pay a visit to your kin based on how hard they keep my commandments. I gave ‘em this land, and it's holy to me; I ain’t cursing it unless it's for wickedness; so, I’ll visit your folks just like I said, and their mess-ups gonna weigh heavy on ‘em.
After I, Enos, heard these words, my faith in the Lord got real strong; I prayed hard for my brothers, the Lamanites.
And it came to pass that after I prayed my heart out, the Lord spoke to me: I’ll give you what you ask for, 'cause of your faith.
And look here, this was what I wanted—that if my people, the Nephites, messed up and got wiped out but the Lamanites didn’t, that the Lord God would keep a record of my folks, even if it took His holy power to bring it out one day for the Lamanites to maybe find their way to salvation—
‘Cause right then, all our effort to bring 'em back to the real faith was a flop. They were swearin' in their fury that if they could, they’d wipe out our records, us, and all the stories from our fathers.
So, knowin’ God was capable of keepin’ our records safe, I cried out to Him constantly, 'cause He told me: Whatever y’all ask in faith, thinkin’ you’ll receive it in the name of Christ, you gonna get it.
And I had that faith, and I cried out to God to preserve them records; He promised me that He’d bring 'em back to the Lamanites in His own good time.
And I, Enos, knew it’d go just like the promise He made; my soul found rest in that.
And the Lord said to me: Your daddies done asked me this too; it’ll happen for ‘em like it’ll happen for you; they had faith like yours.
And then it came to pass that I, Enos, was out wanderin’ 'round among the Nephites, prophesying what was to come, and telling 'em what I heard and saw.
I can testify that the Nephites were tryin’ real hard to bring the Lamanites back to true faith in God. But our work was in vain; their hatred was deep-rooted, and they were led by their wicked ways, turnin' into wild, fierce folks, bloodthirsty, full of idol worship and muck; feedin’ on beasts, livin' in tents, wanderin' the wilderness, wearin' just a little skin wrap ‘round their middle and their heads all shaved; they were good with bow and sword and axe. Many didn’t eat nothin' but raw meat, always tryin’ to destroy us.
Now, it come to pass that the Nephites worked the land, growin' all kinds of grains, fruits, and raisin' herds of cattle, goats, wild goats, and a whole bunch of horses.
And we had a heap of prophets among us. But the folks were stiff-necked, hard to get through to.
There wasn’t nothin’ but tough love, preachin' ‘bout wars, fights, and destruction, keepin' 'em reminded of death, eternity, and God’s judgments, keepin' 'em stirred up to stay in the fear of the Lord. I say, nothin' short of that and real plain talk could keep ‘em from headin' straight for destruction. And that’s how I got to writin' about 'em.
I saw fights between the Nephites and the Lamanites in my day.
And it come to pass that I started feelin' old, and a hundred seventy-nine years done slipped by since our daddy Lehi left Jerusalem.
I realized I’d be takin' a dirt nap soon, 'cause God was workin' on me to preach and prophesy to this people, sayin' the word according to the truth that’s in Christ. And I’ve been shoutin' it out all my days, and found joy in it over what the world had to offer.
And I’ll soon be headin' to my restin' place, which is with my Redeemer; 'cause I know in Him I’ll find that rest. And I look forward to the day when my mortal frame puts on immortality, and I stand before Him; then I’ll see His face with happiness, and He’ll say to me: “Come on in, you blessed one, got a spot ready for ya in my Father’s house.” Amen.
