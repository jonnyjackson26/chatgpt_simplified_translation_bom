Well, it went down like this, them Lamanites didn’t show up for another tussle 'til ten whole years had rolled on by. And I had my folks, the Nephites, busy gettin' their land and weapons all ready for when the fight would come 'round again.
Then the Lord told me somethin’ like, “Yell out to these folks—get 'em to repent, come on over to me, and get baptized, build my church back up and I’ll spare ya.”
So I hollered at 'em, but bless my soul, it was all for nothin’; they didn’t get that it was the Lord who had kept 'em safe and given 'em another shot at repentance. Instead, they went and hardened their hearts against their God.
Well, wouldn’t ya know it, after that tenth year went by, makin' it three hundred sixty years since Christ showed up, the king of the Lamanites sent me a letter lettin’ me know they was gettin’ ready to come back and fight us again.
So, I gathered my people up at the land Desolation, right at the edge by that narrow pass that leads down south.
We set our armies there, tryin' to stop the Lamanites from takin' over any of our land; we fortified ourselves against 'em with every ounce of strength we got.
In that three hundred sixty-first year, them Lamanites came down to the city of Desolation lookin' for a fight; and y'all wouldn’t believe it, but we whipped 'em back so good they skedaddled back to their own lands.
Then in the three hundred sixty-second year, they came down again for another round. We beat 'em down again, takin’ out a whole mess of ‘em, and their bodies got tossed into the sea.
Now, 'cause of all the glory my Nephite folks had racked up, they started puffin’ themselves up, swearin’ to the heavens they was gonna get back at the blood of their fallen kin who’d been killed by them foes.
They swore by the heavens and by God’s throne that they was fixin’ to head on up against their enemies and wipe 'em off the map.
And from that moment on, I, Mormon, straight-up refused to be their leader no more, ‘cause they was livin’ in wickedness and all sorts of abominations.
I had led ‘em plenty despite their misdeeds, lovin’ 'em like God wanted me to, with all my heart; and I’d poured my soul out in prayer for 'em all day long, but it was all without any faith, ‘cause their hearts were too hard.
I done saved ‘em three times from their enemies, and they hadn’t changed their ways one bit.
When they swore by everything that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ told ‘em not to, that they’d go after their enemies to settle the score, the voice of the Lord came to me sayin’:
“Vengeance is mine, and I’ll pay 'em back; and ‘cause this people didn’t repent after I saved ‘em, they’re gonna get cut off from the face of the earth.”
So, I flat-out refused to go up against my enemies after that; I did just as the Lord commanded me, standin' there as a quiet witness to show the world what I seen and heard, thanks to the Spirit givin’ me a heads up on what was to come.
That’s why I’m writin’ to you folks out there, Gentiles, and y’all too, house of Israel, when the work starts, y’all better get ready to head back to your inheritances.
Yup, I’m writin’ to all corners of the earth; to you twelve tribes of Israel, who’re gonna be judged based on what y’all done, by them twelve Jesus picked for his disciples in Jerusalem.
And I’m also sendin’ this message to the leftover folks from this people, who’ll also be judged by them twelve Jesus picked in this land, and by the other twelve he picked in Jerusalem.
The Spirit’s revealin' all this to me; that’s why I’m puttin’ this down for y’all. I want ya to know y’all gonna stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that’s right, every soul from Adam’s family; and y’all gonna be judged for what ya did, whether it was good or bad.
And I reckon it's also so y’all will believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ that y’all gonna hear about; and that the Jews, the Lord's covenant people, will have more proof besides just the one they saw and heard, that Jesus, the one they killed, is the real Christ and the true God.
And I sure wish I could persuade all y’all out there to repent and get ready to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.
