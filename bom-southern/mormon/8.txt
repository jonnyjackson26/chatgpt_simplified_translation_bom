Well now, listen here, I’m Moroni, and I’m finishin’ up my dad’s record, you see. I ain't got much to scribble down, just a few things my daddy told me I gotta write.
So, it happened after that wild and crazy battle at Cumorah, that the Nephites who got away and ran down south were tracked down by them Lamanites, and let me tell ya, they didn’t spare ‘em none.
And my poor daddy, well, he got done in by them too. Here I am, all by my lonesome, penning this sorrowful story of my people bein’ wiped out. But lookie here, they’re all gone, and I’m just doin’ what my daddy told me to. As for whether they’ll take me down too, I reckon I just don’t know.
So I’m fixin’ to write and bury these records in the ground; where I’m headin’, it don’t really matter none.
My daddy wrote this here record, and he had it clear in his mind what he wanted to say. I’d be scribblin' it too if I had some room on these plates, but I ain’t got none; and truth be told, I’m just all alone. My daddy’s gone, and so’s my kinfolk, and I ain’t got a soul to turn to; and how much longer the Lord’s gonna let me stick around, well, I ain’t got a clue.
Looky here, it’s been four hundred years since our Lord and Savior made his entrance.
And let me tell ya, the Lamanites been huntin’ my people, the Nephites, all over creation, from town to town, till there just ain’t no more of us left; and it’s been quite a fall, I tell ya; it’s a wonder to behold how my people have been wiped out.
And make no mistake, it's the Lord’s hand at play here. And ya know what? The Lamanites are fightin’ each other too; this whole land's just a mess of murder and bloodshed; nobody knows when it'll all come to an end.
And now, I ain’t got much more to say ‘bout ‘em, ‘cause all that’s left are the Lamanites and a bunch of thieves round here.
Ain't nobody knowin’ the true God ‘cept for the followers of Jesus, who hung around till folks got so wicked that the Lord wouldn’t let ‘em stay no more; and as for whether they’re still here? Well, who can say?
But my daddy and I sure did see ‘em, and they helped us out.
Now, whoever reads this record, and don’t go judgin’ it for its warts and all, they’re gonna learn some pretty amazing things. I’m Moroni, and if I could, I’d share the whole shebang with ya.
Alright, I'm wrapin’ up my talk ‘bout this here folks. I’m the son of Mormon, and my daddy was kin to Nephi.
And here I am, hiding this record for the Lord; them plates ain’t worth much, ‘cause the Lord told me no one’s ‘sposed to be using ‘em to line their pockets. But this record’s got great worth, and whoever brings it to light, the Lord’s gonna bless ‘em.
Ain’t nobody got the power to bring it out ‘less the Lord gives it to ‘em; ‘cause the Lord wants it done with an eye aimed straight at His glory, or to help out His old, scattered folks.
And bless the one who brings this thing to light; it’ll come outta the dark into the light, just as the Lord said it would; yeah, it’ll come up from the ground and shine bright for all to see, and it’ll be done through the Lord’s power.
And if there’s any mess-ups, well, that’s just human. But let me tell ya, we don’t see no faults ourselves; but God knows everything, so whoever’s bein' judgmental better watch out, ‘cause they might be in a heap of trouble.
And if someone’s sayin', "Show me, or else!"—they better tread carefully, ‘cause they might just be callin’ for somethin’ the Lord has forbidden.
‘Cause lemme say, those who judge too quickly gonna get judged back just as quick; just like their works, so too shall their payback be; that means whoever throws a punch gonna get one back from the Lord.
Now, look at what the good book says—ain’t no man supposed to throw punches or judge; ‘cause judgment’s the Lord’s, and so is vengeance, and He’ll make it right.
And anyone who breathes out anger and fights against the Lord’s work, and the folks who got His covenant—the house of Israel—who says, “We’ll wreck the Lord’s work, and He won’t remember His promise”—that person’s dancin’ on thin ice, waiting to be cut down and thrown into the fire;
‘Cause the Lord’s big ol’ plans gonna keep on rollin’, till all His promises come true.
Look through the prophecies of Isaiah. But I ain’t got ‘em to write down. Yeah, I tell ya, those saints who came before me, who had this land, they’re gonna be cryin’, even from the dust, callin’ on the Lord; and as sure as the Lord lives, He’ll remember the covenant He made with ‘em.
And He knows their prayers, and He knows they prayed for their kin. He knows their faith too, ‘cause with His name, they could move mountains; with His name, they’d make the earth shake; and by His word, they’d knock down prisons; even fires wouldn’t touch ‘em, nor wild beasts or snakes, all thanks to the power of His word.
And yeah, their prayers were also for the one the Lord would let bring these things to light.
And ain’t nobody gotta say they won’t come, ‘cause they surely will; the Lord said it, after all; they’ll come up from the ground, by the hand of the Lord, and no one can stop it; and it’ll happen on a day when folks think miracles are gone, like if someone talked to ‘em from the dead.
And it’ll happen on a day when the blood of saints cries out to the Lord, ‘cause of all them secret schemes and dark doin’s.
Yeah, it’ll come on a day when folks deny God’s power, and churches get all dirty and puffed up with pride; yeah, even on a day when church leaders and teachers get all high and mighty, even envying their own people.
Yeah, it’ll come on a day when there’s fires, and storms, and smoke clouds in faraway places;
And there’ll be chatter of wars, rumors of wars, and quakin’ earth in various spots.
Yeah, it’ll come on a day when the earth’s gonna be polluted real bad; folks will be killin’, robbin’, lyin’, deceivin’, running after all kinds of nasty stuff; when many’ll say, “Do this, or do that, it don’t matter none, ‘cause the Lord’s gonna back ‘em up in the end.” But woe to these folks, ‘cause they’re deep in bitterness and trapped in sin.
Yeah, it’ll come on a day when churches spring up saying, “Come on over here, and for a price, you’ll get forgiveness for your sins.”
Oh, you wicked, stubborn folks, why are you buildin’ up these churches just to make a buck? Why're you twistin’ the holy word of God, tryin’ to damn your own souls? Look, keep your eyes on the revelations of God; ‘cause the time’s comin’ when all this gotta happen.
Look, the Lord’s shown me incredible and mind-blowin’ things that’ll come soon, ‘round the time when these things get revealed to y’all.
I’m talkin’ to you like you’re right here, even if you ain’t. But Jesus Christ, He’s shown you to me, and I know what y’all been up to.
And I know y’all walk with pride in your hearts; ‘cause there’s only a few who ain’t puffed up, wearin’ fancy clothes, full of envy, strife, and all sorts of bad behavior; and your churches, yeah, every single one, have been made dirty ‘cause of that pride.
‘Cause y’all love your money, your nice stuff, and dressin’ up them churches more than you love the poor, the needy, the sick, and the ones who need help.
Oh you dirty, hypocritical folks, you teachers sellin’ your souls for things that'll rust away, why’d ya gotta pollute the holy church of God? Why are you scared to take upon yourself the name of Christ? Don’t you think happiness forever is worth more than a misery that never ends, all just for the world’s approval?
Why do you deck yourselves out in things that don’t even have life, while lettin’ the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick just pass you by, without a glance?
Yeah, why are you buildin’ your secret sins just to rake in the dough, causin’ widows to cry out before the Lord, and orphans too, while lettin' the blood of their dead cry out to the Lord for vengeance against you?
Looky here, the sword of vengeance’s hangin’ over ya; and soon enough, He’s gonna avenge the saints’ blood upon ya, ‘cause He ain’t gonna put up with their cries no longer.
