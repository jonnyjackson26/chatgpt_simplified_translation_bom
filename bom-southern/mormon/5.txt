Well, lemme tell ya, I went on out there among them Nephites, and I took back that promise I made 'bout not helpin’ 'em no more; they handed me the reins to their armies again, thinkin’ I could save 'em from their troubles.
But I gotta say, I was feelin’ pretty hopeless, 'cause I knew what the Good Lord had in store fer 'em; they didn’t even bother to turn from their wrongdoings, but just kept fightin' for their lives without askin’ that higher power who made 'em.
So, we were mindin’ our own when those Lamanites came at us while we was tryin’ to take cover in the city of Jordan; but bless their hearts, they got pushed back and didn’t manage to take the city at that time.
Then, wouldn’t ya know it, they came at us again, but we managed to hold on to the city. There was a couple more towns that them Nephites kept standin’ strong in too, which blocked them Lamanites from gettin' into our land to cause any real trouble.
But I gotta tell ya, all those places we passed by, where the folks didn’t come together, got wiped out by the Lamanites, and their towns and villages went up in flames; and that’s how three hundred seventy-nine years just slipped right on by.
Now, in the three hundred and eightieth year, those Lamanites came at us again lookin’ for a fight, and we stood tall against 'em; but it was just a big ol’ waste of time, ‘cause there was so many of 'em they trampled on the Nephites like they was nothin’.
So, we grabbed our boots and high-tailed it again, and some folks were quick enough to escape the Lamanites, while others who couldn’t keep up got taken out.
And now, listen here, I, Mormon, don’t wanna go and stir up all y’all's feelings with a gruesome picture of blood and battle that I saw; but I know it’s gotta be told, 'cause everything that’s hidden's got to come to light—
And folks gotta know all 'bout this here stuff, both the remnant of this people and the Gentiles, who the Good Lord said would scatter us, and we’d end up as nothin’ in their eyes—so I’m puttin’ together a little summary, not tryin’ to spill every detail of what I saw, ‘cause I got a commandment to follow, and I don’t wanna add to your heartache over how wicked these folks have been.
Now, pay attention, 'cause I’m talkin’ to their descendants, and to the Gentiles who care for the house of Israel, who know where their blessings come from.
‘Cause I know they gonna feel real sad about what’s happenin’ to the house of Israel; they gonna feel bad for the folks bein’ destroyed; it’ll hurt 'em that this people didn’t turn around so they could’ve been held close by Jesus.
Now these words are aimed at the leftover folks of Jacob; they’re written like this ‘cause God knows wickedness ain’t gonna lead 'em right; they gonna be kept safe from the world till it’s time for the Lord to show ‘em.
And here’s the command I got, y’all: they gonna come out just like the Lord said when He thinks it’s the right time in His wisdom.
And they gonna go to them unbelievin' Jews; the whole point is to get ‘em convinced that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the livin’ God; so the Father can bring about His big ol’ plan to restore the Jews—and all of Israel—to the land He’s given ‘em, fulfillin’ His promise;
And also, so the kids of this people can really believe the gospel that’s gonna come to ‘em from the Gentiles; ‘cause this people is gonna be scattered, and gonna turn into a dark, filthy mess, worse than anything we ever seen, even worse than the Lamanites, 'cause they just don’t believe and love their idols too much.
For you see, the Spirit of the Lord has already stopped bein’ with their ancestors; they ain't got no Christ and no God in this world, just blowin’ around like chaff in the wind.
They used to be a happy bunch, with Christ lookin’ out for 'em; yeah, they were led by God Himself.
But now, looky here, they bein’ led around by Satan, just like chaff caught in the wind, or a boat tossed around on the waves, with no sail, no anchor, and no way to steer; just like that boat, so are they.
And the Lord’s holdin' back the blessings they coulda had in this land, givin’ ‘em to the Gentiles instead.
But don’t get comfy, ‘cause they gonna be pushed and scattered by them Gentiles; and when that happens, the Lord’s gonna remember the promise He made to Abraham and the whole house of Israel.
And He’s also gonna keep in mind the prayers of the good folks askin’ for help on their behalf.
And then, oh Gentiles, how y’all gonna stand before the power of God unless y’all repent and turn from your sinful ways?
Don’t ya know you’re in God’s hands? Don’t ya realize He’s got all the power, and at His word the earth’s gonna roll up tight like a scroll?
So, you better repent and humble yourselves before Him, or else He’s gonna come down hard on ya—lest some of Jacob’s descendants come at ya like a lion, and tear you apart with no one to save ya.
