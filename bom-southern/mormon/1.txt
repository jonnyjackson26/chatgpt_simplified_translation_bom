Well now, I’m a-fixin’ to write down all the stuff I’ve seen and heard, and I’m callin’ it the Book of Mormon.
So, ‘bout the time when Ammaron stashed away them records with the Lord, he came a’lookin’ for me, ‘cause I was ‘round ten years old and startin’ to learn a bit like my folks did. Ammaron took one look at me and said, “I see you’re a serious kinda kid, quick on the uptake.”
So, when ya hit the ripe ol’ age of twenty-four, I want ya to remember all them things you noticed ‘bout our people; and when you get there, head on over to the land of Antum to a hill called Shim; that’s where I done put all the sacred stuff for the Lord ‘bout our folks.
And listen now, you’re gonna take those Nephi plates with ya, leave the rest where they are, and you’re gonna write down all them things you’ve seen ‘bout our people on them Nephi plates.
Now I, Mormon, bein’ a descendant of Nephi (my daddy’s name was also Mormon), I sure remembered what Ammaron told me.
So, it happened that when I was eleven, my daddy carried me down south to the land of Zarahemla.
Lord, the whole place was just crawlin’ with buildings, and folks were as plentiful as the grains of sand at the beach.
Now, this year, war kicked off ‘tween the Nephites, who were made up of the Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites, and the Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites. It was a real ruckus between them Nephites and Lamanites.
So the Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites all got lumped together as Lamanites, and you had two sides—Nephites and Lamanites.
And sure enough, this war broke out right near Zarahemla by the waters of Sidon.
Well, the Nephites pulled together a mighty fine crowd, over thirty thousand strong. They had themselves a heap of battles that year, and let me tell ya, the Nephites handed the Lamanites their hats and sent many of ‘em to the ground.
Eventually, the Lamanites called off their plans, and peace returned to the land for ‘bout four years—no bloodshed at all.
But on the flip side, wickedness took over the whole land, and the Lord took away His favorite disciples, so there weren’t no miracles or healings ‘cause folks just turned rotten.
There weren’t no gifts from the Lord either, and folks wasn’t feelin’ the Holy Ghost ‘cause of all their sin and doubt.
Now I was fifteen, had a pretty clear head, and the Lord came to visit me. I got to taste and see how good Jesus really is.
I tried to spread the word to my people, but they shut me up and said I couldn’t preach ‘cause they just wouldn’t listen; they up and rebelled against their God, and the beloved disciples got taken away ‘cause of their sin.
I stayed among ‘em, but I couldn’t preach to ‘em ‘cause their hearts were harder than a rock; and ‘cause of that hard-heartedness, the land got cursed on their account.
And those Gadianton robbers among the Lamanites really stirred up trouble, so folks started buryin’ their treasures in the ground. They got slippery ‘cause the Lord cursed the land so they couldn’t keep hold of nothin’.
And let me tell ya, there were all sorts of sorcery, witchcraft, and magic goin’ on; the power of the evil one was all over the land, fulfillin’ what Abinadi and Samuel the Lamanite said.
