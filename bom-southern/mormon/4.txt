Well, let me tell ya, them wars and all that mess just keep on goin’—it’s like the wicked retaliatin' against the wicked. Things are gettin’ worse than ever in Israel—ain’t no way around it. They’re sacrificin’ women and children to them idols, and the Lamanites are gettin' mighty aggressive, pushin’ the Nephites back.
So, it was in the year three hundred sixty-three that the Nephites up and took their armies to battle against the Lamanites, comin’ outta that land called Desolation.
But wouldn’t ya know it, them Nephites got pushed right back to that land of Desolation. And while they were still tryin’ to catch their breath, another fresh army of Lamanites came down on ’em, and boy, did they have a nasty fight! The Lamanites ended up takin’ over the city Desolation, killin’ a whole bunch of Nephites and waltzin' off with a truckload of prisoners.
The ones who made it outta there ran off and joined the folks in the city Teancum. Now, this here city Teancum was sittin’ right by the seashore, not too far from Desolation, I reckon.
This whole ruckus got started ‘cause the Nephites went headin' up to the Lamanites; if they hadn’t done that, them Lamanites wouldn’t have stood a chance against 'em.
But hold on now, God’s got a way of settlin’ scores with the wicked; it’s the bad folks who end up makin' trouble for the other bad folks, stirrin’ up the hearts of good folks to spill blood.
So, the Lamanites started gettin' their ducks in a row to come at the city Teancum.
And in the year three hundred sixty-four, those Lamanites rolled on up to Teancum, tryin’ to lay claim to that city too.
But wouldn’t ya know it, the Nephites pushed back and sent ‘em packin’. When the Nephites saw they had driven the Lamanites away, they got all puffed up about their strength again, marchin’ right back to take Desolation once more.
Well, that was all well and good, but by now, there were thousands layin’ dead on both sides, Nephites and Lamanites alike.
Then, in the year three hundred sixty-six, the Lamanites came back on them Nephites ready for a scrap again; and still, the Nephites weren’t changin’ their wicked ways, just kept diggin’ in deeper.
Now listen up, it’s mighty hard to put into words, or even write down, the horrid sight of all that blood and destruction on both Nephites and Lamanites. Folks’ hearts were so hard they found joy in spillin' blood all the time.
There ain’t never been such wickedness among Lehi’s offspring, nor in all the house of Israel, as what these people were up to, accordin' to the Lord’s own words.
Then the Lamanites waltzed on in and took the city Desolation ‘cause they had more folks than the Nephites did.
And they didn’t stop there—they marched on to Teancum, pushin’ the folks right outta there, takin’ women and children as prisoners, and offerin’ ‘em up to their idol gods.
So, in the year three hundred sixty-seven, them Nephites got fired up ‘cause the Lamanites had sacrificed their women and children, and they charged against the Lamanites with some serious rage, beatin' the tar outta ‘em and driving ‘em from their lands.
The Lamanites didn’t come back for a tussle until the year three hundred seventy-five.
In that year, they came down hard on the Nephites, bringin’ all their might; and nobody knew how many there were ‘cause there were just so dang many of ‘em.
From that point onward, the Nephites lost all the power they had over the Lamanites and started gettin’ swept away like dew in the morning sun.
Next thing ya know, the Lamanites came down on the city Desolation, and boy, was there a savage fight in that land—those Lamanites really tangled up the Nephites good.
They ran off again, escaping, and made their way to the city Boaz, where they stood their ground against the Lamanites with some serious backbone, not bein' knocked down until the Lamanites took a second shot at 'em.
Well, when that second round came, the Nephites got driven back and suffered a dreadful defeat; their women and children were sacrificed again to them idols.
So, what’s more, the Nephites took off again, grabbin’ all the folks with ‘em, both in towns and out in the sticks.
And here I am, Mormon, seein’ that the Lamanites were fixin' to take down the land, so I hiked it up to the hill Shim and gathered up all the records Ammaron had hidden away for the Lord.
