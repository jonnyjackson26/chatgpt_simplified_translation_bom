Well now, let me tell ya, it came to pass that I, Omni, was told by my daddy, Jarom, that I oughta jot down some stuff on these here plates to keep track of our family tree—
So, back in my day, I want y’all to know I tussled a whole lot with my sword tryin’ to protect my folks, the Nephites, from fallin’ into the hands of them Lamanites. But hey, I gotta confess, I’m just a no-good, rotten sinner, and I ain't followed the Lord's rules like I should’ve.
Then it happened that two hundred and seventy-six years went by, and we had our fair share of peaceful times, but also some serious wars and blood spilled. Yup, in total, two hundred eighty-two years went by, and I kept these plates like my folks told me to; I handed 'em off to my boy Amaron. And that’s a wrap.
Now I, Amaron, I’m just gonna write down the few bits of stuff I’m gonna put in my daddy’s book.
Well, it came to pass that three hundred twenty years rolled on by, and the nastier part of the Nephites got wiped out.
The Lord, He just wouldn’t let ‘em be, even after leadin’ ‘em outta Jerusalem and keepin’ 'em safe from their enemies. Yep, He wasn’t ‘bout to let His words go unfulfilled, which He told our ancestors—that if y’all don’t follow my commandments, you ain't gonna do well in the land.
So the Lord showed ‘em some serious judgment; but don’t you worry, He spared the good folks so they wouldn’t be lost, and He got 'em outta the clutches of their enemies.
Then I went ahead and passed the plates onto my bro Chemish.
Now I’m Chemish, and I’m gonna write down what little I got to share in the same book as my brother; ’cause I saw with my own eyes the last bit he wrote, and he did that right when he handed 'em over to me. And we keep our records this way, just like our daddies said to. And that’s all for me.
Hey now, I’m Abinadom, son of Chemish. It come to pass that I witnessed a whole lotta war and arguments between my folks, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I’ve done took the lives of many Lamanites with my own sword fightin’ for my kin.
And y’see, the record of these folks is etched on plates, kept by the kings through the ages; and I don’t know nothin' ‘cept what’s already been wrote, no prophecies neither; so whatever’s enough, that’s what’s written down. And that’s it for me.
Well, I’m Amaleki, son of Abinadom. And I’m fixin' to say a little somethin’ ‘bout Mosiah, who was made king over Zarahemla; ‘cause you see, he got a warning from the Lord to hightail it outta Nephi, and anyone who would listen to Him should skedaddle too, out into the wilderness—
And sure enough, he did what the Lord told him. So they all packed up and left the land for the wilderness, all who would listen; they were guided by plenty of preachin’ and prophecy. They kept gettin’ told by God’s word, and they were led by His strong hand, through the wild until they hit the land called Zarahemla.
And lo and behold, they found a folks called the people of Zarahemla. Now, there was a whole lotta rejoicin’ among the Zarahemla crowd; and good ol’ Zarahemla rejoiced somethin’ fierce, ‘cause the Lord had sent Mosiah's folks back with them brass plates holdin’ the Jewish history.
Well, it came to pass that Mosiah found out them Zarahemlaites come outta Jerusalem when Zedekiah, king of Judah, got carried off to Babylon.
They traveled through the wild, and the Lord’s hand brought ‘em across the big waters, ‘til Mosiah found 'em; and they'd been livin’ there ever since.
And at the time Mosiah discovered ‘em, there were a whole heap of ‘em. But boy howdy, they had their fair share of fights and serious scrapes, and they fell by the sword many a time; their language got all kinds of mixed up; and they didn’t bring no records with ‘em; and they didn’t even believe in their Creator; and Mosiah and his folks couldn’t make heads or tails of ‘em.
But Mosiah made sure they got taught his language. And after they learned what Mosiah spoke, Zarahemla gave 'em a rundown of his family line, just like he could remember; and it’s written down, but not on these plates.
And it come to pass that the people of Zarahemla and Mosiah joined forces, and Mosiah was made their king.
Now, in Mosiah’s time, a big ol’ stone was brought to him with some carvings on it; and by the grace of God, he figured out what them carvings meant.
And it told the tale of one Coriantumr and the folks he lost. Coriantumr was found by the Zarahemlaites, and he stayed with ‘em for nine moons.
And it even had a few words about his folks. His first ancestors came down from the tower when the Lord mixed up the language of the people, and the Lord’s judgment fell on ‘em proper; their bones lay scattered up north.
Hey now, I’m Amaleki, born in the days of Mosiah; and I’ve lived long enough to see him pass on; and Benjamin, his boy, is reignin' now.
And I reckon I’ve seen, in King Benjamin's days, a real serious fight and plenty of bloodshed ‘tween the Nephites and the Lamanites. But the Nephites came out on top over ‘em; so much so that King Benjamin drove ‘em outta Zarahemla.
Well, it come to pass that I was startin’ to get old, and without no kids, and knowin’ King Benjamin’s a right stand-up fella before the Lord, so I figured I’d hand over these plates to him, tellin’ folks to come to God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophecy, revelations, angels, talkin’ in tongues, and interpretin’ languages, and all things good; ‘cause there ain't nothin' good unless it comes from the Lord, and all the bad stuff comes from the devil.
And now, my dear brothers, I want ya to come to Christ, the Holy One of Israel, and take part in His salvation and redemption power. Yeah, come to Him and offer your whole selves as an offering, keep fastin’ and prayin’, and hang on until the end; and as sure as the Lord lives, you’ll be saved.
And now I gotta say a few words ‘bout a bunch that went up into the wild tryin’ to get back to Nephi; ‘cause there was a big ol’ crowd wantin’ to grab their inheritance land.
So they took off up into the wild. Their leader was a strong, stubborn fella, and he stirred up a fuss among ‘em all; and they ended up being wiped out, except for fifty, out in the wilderness, and they made their way back to Zarahemla.
And so it happened they took some others along too, and headed back into the wilderness again.
And I, Amaleki, had a brother who went with ‘em; and I ain't heard a lick about ‘em since. And I’m about to lay myself down for a long nap in the grave; these plates are full. And that’s all I got to say.
