Well, lemme tell ya, in that forty-third year of them judges, folks 'round Nephi weren't arguin’ much, 'cept maybe a pinch of pride in the church, stirrin' up a tad bit of fuss among 'em, but they settled all that by the end of the year.
Now, in that forty-fourth year, there wasn’t much fuss goin’ on, and the same goes for the forty-fifth year, too.
But shoot, come forty-six, well, it got real rowdy with a heap of disagreements; lots of folks packed up and skedaddled outta Zarahemla, headin’ north lookin' for greener pastures.
They went on a long ol’ trek, far enough that they found some big ol’ lakes and plenty of rivers.
Yup, they spread out all over the land, wherever it wasn’t all dried up and bare, ‘cause there was too many folks livin’ in the land before.
Ain't no part of the land stayed barren, ‘cept it was short on timber; that destruction done happened to the people before made it seem all desolate.
With not much timber left ‘round, they sure got good at workin’ with cement; built ‘em some sturdy houses of that stuff to live in.
And wouldn't ya know it, they multiplied and spread out everywhere, movin’ from the south to the north, coverin’ the whole dang earth, from sea to sea.
Them folks up north, they lived in tents and cement houses, lettin’ any tree that sprouted grow up, hopin’ one day they’d have timber for their homes, cities, temples, and all sorts of buildin’s.
And since timber was mighty rare up yonder, they started shippin’ in a whole lotta it.
That’s how they got them folks up north to buildin’ a heap of cities, both with wood and cement.
Now, I reckon some of Ammon's folks, them Lamanites by blood, went up into that land too.
And right now, there's a whole mess of records kept by the Nephites about what’s been goin’ on with 'em; it’s a long story with lots of details.
But lemme tell ya, a hundredth part of what went down, the wars and squabbles, preachin’, prophecies, shippin’, buildin’ temples and synagogues, and the good and bad stuff they did, ain't fit to be crammed into this here work.
And I’ll be darned, but there’s a whole pile of books and records of all sorts kept mostly by the Nephites.
These records been passed down from one generation to the next, even ‘til they fell into sin and got hunted down, murdered, and scattered all over the earth, mixin’ in with the Lamanites till they weren't known as Nephites no more, turnin’ wicked and wild.
Now back to my tale; what I'm sayin’ happened after a whole lotta fuss, disturbances, wars, and disagreements among them Nephites.
The forty-sixth year of them judges wrapped up;
And it just so happened, that in the forty-seventh year, the land was still filled with argument, and it lingered on into the forty-eighth year.
But Helaman, he sure kept that judgment seat filled with fairness and justice; he was faithful ‘bout keepin’ God’s laws and did what was right in His eyes, followin’ in his father’s footsteps makin’ life work for 'im.
He had two sons; the oldest he named Nephi, and the youngest was called Lehi, and they were raisin’ up to serve the Lord.
By the time they got to the latter end of the forty-eighth year, those wars and arguments started to simmer down a bit among the Nephites.
Now in the forty-ninth year of judges, the land found some peace, ‘cept for them sneaky secret groups Gadianton the robber set up in the more settled areas, they were hidin’ from the ones runnin' the government, so they weren’t wiped out.
That same year, the church was just doin’ so well, folks by the thousands was joinin’ up and gettin’ baptized for repentance.
The church was boom’n, and the blessings they got had even the high priests and teachers taken aback.
The Lord’s work was movin’ right along, gatherin' plenty of folks into His church, even tens of thousands.
So y’see, the Lord’s mighty merciful to all who’ll call on His name with a genuine heart.
Yup, the gate to heaven’s wide open for anyone who’s willin’ to believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Anyone can grab ahold of the word of God, powerful enough to cut right through all the devil's tricks and lead a fella down the narrow path across that miserable gulf meant for the wicked—
To land their souls, yes, their eternal souls, right there with God in heaven, sittin’ with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the holy fathers, never to leave again.
And in that year, folks was just celebratin’ all over Zarahemla and the parts around it, in every bit of land the Nephites held.
It turned out, there was peace and real joy in what was left of the forty-ninth year; and the fiftieth year of judges brought even more peace and good cheer.
Then in the fifty-first year of judges, there was peace again, but pride started creepin' into the church— not God’s church, but in the hearts of the folks claimin’ to be part of it—
And they got all puffed up with pride, even persecutin’ a lot of their own brothers. Now that was a real mess, causin' the humble folks to face a heap of troubles and trials.
Still, they prayed and fasted a lot, growin’ stronger in their humility and faith in Christ, fillin’ their souls with joy and comfort, purifyin’ their hearts ‘cause they turned 'em over to God.
That fifty-second year wrapped up in peace too, ‘cept for all that pride fillin’ the hearts of the people; their riches and prosperity just kept growing on ‘em day by day.
Then in the fifty-third year of the reign of the judges, Helaman passed away, and his oldest son Nephi took over. He filled that judgment seat fair and square, keptin’ God’s commandments and walkin’ in his daddy's ways.
