Well now, here’s how it all played out in that seventy-second year of the judges’ reign, folks were arguin' so much that it kicked off wars all 'round in the land of Nephi.
And it was them sneaky robbers causin' all sorts of trouble and messin' things up real bad. That war went on the whole year long, and shoot, it was still goin' on in the seventy-third year.
So one fine day, Nephi hollered out to the Lord, sayin':
"Hey Lord, don’t let these folks get wiped out by the sword! Instead, how 'bout a famine to make ‘em remember you, their God, and maybe then they’ll shape up and come back to ya."
And lo and behold, the Lord did just that, and there was a mighty famine spreadin’ across the land, hittin' all them Nephites hard. So come the seventy-fourth year, the famine rolled on, and folks stopped bein' killed by swords but got hurtin’ real bad from the lack of food.
Now that destruction kept rollin' through the seventy-fifth year. The ground was bone dry, not a speck of grain comin' up when it was time for harvestin’, even the Lamanites were takin' hits, and thousands of 'em were goin’ under in the worst parts of the land.
Then folks realized they was on the brink of starvin', and they started rememberin' their God again; them words from Nephi started comin’ back to ‘em.
So they started plead in’ with their chief judges and leaders to reach out to Nephi: “Hey, we know you’re a man of God, so please, pray to our Lord to lift this famine off us, or else all them dire warnings you’ve been givin’ us might just come true.”
And sure enough, those judges called on Nephi just like they wanted. Well, when Nephi saw everybody givin’ in and humblin' themselves wearin' sackcloth, he cried out to the Lord again, sayin':
“Lord, lookie here, this crowd’s repentin’; they’ve run off them Gadianton robbers so much they’ve disappeared, and they’ve hid their sneaky plans in the dirt.”
“Now, Lord, 'cause of their humbleness, will ya cool down your anger and let go of destroyin' them wicked men you done already taken care of?”
“Lord, can ya ease up your anger, the fire of it, and let that famine lift from this land?”
“Lord, do listen to me, and make it so like I asked, send down rain on this dry ground so it gives back its fruits, and let us have our grain when it’s supposed to.”
“Lord, you listened when I asked for a famine to stop the sword's pestilence; I know you’ll listen again 'cause you promised me: if these folks shape up, you'll keep 'em safe.”
“Yep, Lord, you see they’re turnin’ back ‘cause of that famine and all the trouble that fell on ‘em.”
“Now, Lord, can ya let go of your anger and give ‘em another chance to see if they’ll serve ya? If that’s the case, Lord, you can bless ‘em just like you said you would.”
And so it happened that in the seventy-sixth year, the Lord turned his anger away from the people and caused it to rain, so much that the land brought forth its fruits in season. And sure enough, it came up with grain at the right time too.
And the folks were shoutin’ and givin’ glory to God, the whole land lit up with joy, and they stopped tryin’ to bring harm to Nephi; instead, they held him in high esteem as a great prophet, a man of God, with a whole heap of power givin’ to him from above.
And let me tell ya, Lehi, his brother, wasn’t laggin' behind none when it came to doin’ right by God.
So it was that the Nephites started prosperin’ again, fixin’ up their run-down spots, multiplyin’ and spreadin’ out until they covered every bit of land, from the west sea to the east sea, north and south.
Come the end of that seventy-sixth year, they rolled right on into peace. Then the seventy-seventh year kicked off peaceful too; the church spread far and wide, with a big chunk of the people, both Nephites and Lamanites, joinin’ in, enjoyin’ a heap of peace; and that’s how the seventy-seventh year wrapped up. 
And they had peace again in the seventy-eighth year, 'cept for a few disagreements 'bout some points of doctrine the prophets passed down.
But then, in the seventy-ninth year, arguments flared back up. However, Nephi, Lehi, and their brethren, who had a good grasp on the right doctrine and were gettin' daily revelations, preached to the folks, and by that same year, they managed to put an end to that strife.
Then, in the eightieth year of judges runnin’ things over Nephi’s folks, some of them dissidents who once turned from Nephi and signed up with the Lamanites stirred up a ruckus, rallyin' the real Lamanites to go to war against their own kin.
They started a whole mess of murder and plunderin’, then scampered back up into the mountains and out into the wilderness, hidin’ out so folks couldn’t catch ‘em, all the while swellin’ their ranks with more dissidents comin’ to join their cause.
So, over time, in just a few years, they formed a massive band of robbers, huntin’ down all them Gadianton schemes, and they straight up became Gadianton robbers themselves.
Well, lemme tell ya, these robbers made quite a ruckus, causin’ heaps of destruction among Nephites and Lamanites alike.
It became clear they had to stop this destructive madness; so they sent a strong army into the wilderness and up in the mountains to hunt down this band of robbers and wipe 'em out.
But wouldn’t ya know, even that year, they got driven back to their own lands. And that’s how the eightieth year of the judges came to an end over Nephi’s lot.
As the eighty-first year started rollin’, they went back at 'em again, takin’ out a whole mess of ‘em, but they also took a few hits themselves.
They had to retreat once more outta the wilderness and back to their own lands 'cause the robbers put up a good fight, and there were just too many of ‘em runnin’ around in the mountains and the wild.
And so this year ended, but the robbers kept growin' and gettin’ stronger, showin’ no fear to go up against the armies of Nephites and Lamanites alike, creatin’ a heap of dread for folks all across the land.
Yessiree, they raided all over the place, bringin’ about all sorts of destruction; killin’ many and cartin' off others, especially women and children, into the wilderness.
Now this big ol' mess came upon the people 'cause of their wrongdoings, and it shook ‘em awake to remember the Lord their God.
And that’s how the eighty-first year of them judges wrapped up.
Then in the eighty-second year, they started slippin’ back, forgettin’ their Lord again. By the eighty-third year, they were growin' strong in their wicked ways. And in the eighty-fourth year, they just wouldn’t shape up.
When the eighty-fifth year rolled around, they got prouder and prouder in their wrongdoing, ridin' that slippery slope right back to destruction again.
And that’s how the eighty-fifth year came to a close.
