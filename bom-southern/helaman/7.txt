Well now, lemme tell ya, in the sixty-ninth year of them judges runnin' the Nephites, Nephi, Helaman's boy, come back down to Zarahemla from up north.
He'd been out preachin' to them folks up north, givin' 'em the good word and prophesyin' all sorts of things.
But they sure did turn him away, so much so that he just couldn’t stick around—had to head back to where he was born.
And when he laid eyes on how downright wicked the people was, with them Gadianton robbers sittin’ in the judgment seats—usurpin’ the good Lord’s power and authority, tossin’ God’s commandments aside and bein’ all sorts of wrong—he just couldn’t believe it.
Them righteous folks were bein’ condemned for bein’ good, while the guilty ones got off scot-free 'cause they was rich. And on top of that, they were the ones runnin’ the government, doin’ what they pleased just to fill their pockets and hold on to their glory, makin' it easier to cheat and steal.
This here big ol’ iniquity crept up on the Nephites in no time, and when Nephi caught wind of it, his heart was bustin’ with sorrow. He couldn’t help but shout out in his pain.
Oh, how I wish I coulda lived back when my daddy Nephi first hightailed it outta Jerusalem, so I coulda shared in the joys of the promised land. Back then, them folks was easy to talk to, always stickin' to God’s commandments, and didn’t hardly stray into wickedness at all. They was quick to listen to the Lord’s words.
If only I'd been around back then, my heart would’ve danced with the righteousness of my kinfolk.
But here I am, stuck in these days, and my heart’s full of sorrow 'cause of all the wickedness my people are up to.
And lo and behold, Nephi was up on a tower in his garden, right by the main road that led to the market in Zarahemla. He was bent low on that tower, near the garden gate, prayin’ his heart out to God.
Well, a few fellas passed by and saw him pourin’ out his soul up there, and they ran off to tell others what they seen, gatherin’ a whole crowd tryin’ to understand why ole Nephi was so torn up over the wickedness all around.
When Nephi stood up, he looked and saw all them folks gathered 'round.
And he opened his mouth and asked, What’s all this fuss about? Y’all come together just so I can lay out your wrongdoings?
Yep, 'cause I climbed up here on my tower just to spill my heart to God about the heavy sorrow I feel 'cause of your wicked ways!
Y’all saw me mournin' and wondered about it; and you dang right you ought to wonder, 'cause it’s a shame how the devil's got such a tight grip on your hearts.
How on earth could y’all let yourself be tempted by the one who wants to drag your souls down to endless misery and sorrow?
Oh, y’all need to repent, repent! Why y’all wanna die? Turn back to your Lord and God. Why’s He turned His back on ya?
It’s 'cause y’all got hearts of stone; you won’t listen to the good shepherd. You’ve made Him mad with your ways.
And listen here, if y’all don’t gather together to repent, He’s gonna scatter ya like leaves in the wind, and you’ll be just food for dogs and beasts out there.
How could you forget your God right after He saved ya?
But I reckon it’s all about chasin’ after gold and silver, wanna be praised by folks. You got your hearts set on riches and all the flashy nonsense of this world, which makes ya murder, plunder, steal, and bear false witness against your neighbors, dabblin' in all sorts of evil.
And for all that, woe is comin’ on y’all unless ya turn around. If you don’t, this great city, along with all the other towns 'round here that we call home, is gonna be snatched away from ya; the Lord ain’t gonna give you the strength to stand against your enemies like He used to.
For the Lord done said: I ain't gonna show my strength to no wicked folks, not one over another, 'cept for those who repent and listen to my word. So, y’all wanna pay attention, 'cause it'll be better for the Lamanites than for ya if you don’t turn away from your sins.
'Cause they ain’t done nothin' wrong against the great knowledge you’ve had; the Lord will be merciful to 'em, givin’ them long lives and lots of kin, while you folks risk bein’ wiped out if ya don’t change your ways.
Woe to you for that great abomination that’s come among you; you’ve joined yourselves up with that secret gang kickstarted by Gadianton!
Woe's comin' for you 'cause of that pride that snuck into your hearts, puffin’ you up 'way past what’s good just 'cause of your big ol’ piles of riches!
Woe to you for all your wickedness and sins!
And if you don’t repent, you’ll be done for, and I ain't just whistlin’ Dixie; your lands will be taken from ya, and you’ll be wiped off the face of the earth.
Now I ain't sayin’ all this just 'cause I woke up thinkin’ it; it ain't from me that I know this stuff—it's the Lord God who showed me the truth of it all, and I stand here testifying that it’s real.
