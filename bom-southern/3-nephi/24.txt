Well, it happened that He told ‘em to write down them words the Father gave to Malachi, so he could fill ‘em in. Then, after they put it all down, He went on to explain it. Here’s what He shared with ‘em: The Father said to Malachi—Y’all best pay attention, ‘cause I’m sendin’ my messenger who’s gonna clear the path for me, and the Lord you’re searchin’ for is fixin’ to show up at His temple, the messenger of the covenant, the one that makes your heart warm; yep, He’s comin’, says the Lord on high.
But who in the world can handle the day He shows up, and who can stand tall when He appears? He’s gonna burn brighter than a blacksmith’s fire, and folks better be ready to get scrubbed clean.
He’ll be sittin’ there like a silversmith, purifyin’ silver; He’ll clean up the sons of Levi and refine ‘em like gold and silver, so they can bring a right offering to the Lord.
Then Judah and Jerusalem’s offerings are gonna smell real sweet to the Lord, just like back in the good ol’ days, like long ago.
And I’ll be comin’ near to judge y’all; I’ll be a fast witness against them sorcerers, the cheatin’ husbands, them false swearers, and those who take advantage of the hired hands, the widows and orphans, and turn their back on strangers, and don’t fear me, says the Lord on high.
See, I’m the Lord, I don’t change; that’s why y’all, the sons of Jacob, ain’t been wiped out.
From way back when your daddies was around, y’all drifted away from my laws and didn’t hold onto ‘em. Come back to me and I’ll come back to you, says the Lord on high. But you’re askin’, “How in the world do we come back?”
Can a man rob God? Well shoot, y’all done robbed me. But you’re wonderin’, “How we robbin’ you?” It’s through them tithes and offerings.
You’re under a curse ‘cause you’ve robbed me, and it ain’t just you, it’s this whole nation.
Bring all them tithes to the storehouse, so there’s food in my house; go ahead and test me on this, says the Lord on high, and see if I won’t open up the windows of heaven and bless you so much you won’t have room to hold it all.
And I’ll take care of that devourer on your behalf, and he won’t ruin the fruits of your land; and your vines ain’t gonna drop their fruit too soon in the fields, says the Lord on high.
All them nations will call you blessed, ‘cause you’ll be a land that brings joy, says the Lord on high.
Your words have been mighty tough on me, says the Lord. Yet you’re askin’, “What in the world have we said against you?”
You’ve said it don’t do no good to serve God, and what’s the profit in keepin’ His rules and walkin’ all sad-like before the Lord on high?
Now we’re callin’ the proud folks happy; yep, the ones up to no good look like they’re sittin’ pretty; even them who tempt God seem to get by just fine.
Then those who feared the Lord were chattin’ with each other a lot, and the Lord listened and caught what they said; and a book of remembrance got written up for those who feared the Lord and thought on His name.
And they gonna be mine, says the Lord on high, on that day when I gather up my treasures; I’ll spare ‘em just like a good dad spares his own son who’s down there servin’ him.
Then y’all gonna turn around and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the ones who serve God and the ones who don’t serve Him at all.
