Well now, y’all listen here, Jesus done wrapped up all that preachin’ and looked around at the crowd, sayin’: Y’all heard what I taught before I headed up to see my Daddy; so, whoever remembers what I told ya and puts it into action, I’ll lift 'em up on the last day.
So, right then, when Jesus finished speakin’, he noticed some folks were scratchin’ their heads, wonderin’ what he meant ‘bout the law of Moses; they just couldn’t wrap their minds ‘round the idea that old stuff was gone and everything’s brand new.
And he told ‘em: Don’t be all surprised I said old things done passed away, and everythin’s startin’ fresh and new.
Looky here, I’m tellin’ ya the law Moses got ain’t no more ‘cause it’s fulfilled.
I’m the one who gave y’all that law, I’m the one who made a deal with my folks Israel; so basically, that law’s wrapped up in me, ‘cause I came to finish it off, and there’s a time it all ends.
Now, don’t think I’m out to trash the prophets; whatever ain’t happened through me will surely come to pass, I promise ya that.
So when I told ya old things’ve passed away, I ain’t throwin' out all them words about what’s comin’ next.
Look, the deal I made with my folks ain’t all done yet; but the law Moses received has got its end in me.
Check it out, I’m the law, and I’m the light. Just keep your eyes on me, hang in there till the end, and y’all gonna live; ‘cause for anyone who sticks it out till the end, I’m givin’ eternal life.
Now, I done told ya the commandments, so keep ‘em close. That right there’s the law and the prophets, ‘cause they been speakin' ‘bout me for real.
Well, then Jesus finished up that chat and spoke to the twelve he picked out:
Y’all are my crew, and you’re a light for this here people, who are the leftover kin of the house of Joseph.
And hey, this here’s the land you’ll be claimin’ for your own; the Father’s handed it over to ya.
And at no point did the Father tell me to go blab ‘bout it to your brothers in Jerusalem.
They never did give me the lowdown ‘bout the other tribes of the house of Israel, that the Father led away from home.
Here’s what the Father did tell me to say:
I got other sheep not in this herd; I gotta go fetch ‘em too, and they’ll hear my voice; and we gonna have one big herd with one shepherd.
But since they were stubborn and didn’t believe, they just couldn’t get what I was sayin’; so I was told to keep quiet ‘bout what the Father wanted from me.
But listen here, I’m tellin’ ya straight, the Father gave me the word, and I’m passin’ it on: y’all were kept apart ‘cause of their wrongdoings; that’s why they don’t even know you’re out there.
And I’m tellin’ ya again, the Father set apart the other tribes ‘cause of their sins; so they don’t have a clue ‘bout ‘em neither.
And I’ll say it one more time, y’all are the ones I was speakin’ ‘bout: I got other sheep not in this fold; I gotta reel ‘em in, and they’ll hear my voice; and there’ll be one big fold with one shepherd.
Well, they didn’t quite catch what I meant, reckonin’ it was about the Gentiles; they just didn’t see that the Gentiles’d be turned ‘round by their preachin’.
And they didn’t get that when I said they’d hear my voice; nor did they understand I wouldn’t be showin’ myself to the Gentiles, ‘cept through the Holy Ghost.
But lookie here, y’all have heard my voice and seen me; you’re my sheep, and you’re counted among those the Father handed over to me.
