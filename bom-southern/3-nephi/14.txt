Well now, lemme tell ya, when Jesus spoke those words, He turned back to the crowd and opened His mouth again, sayin’: Listen up, I mean it, don’t be judgin’, or you’ll get judged yourself.
‘Cause the way ya judge folks, that’s how you’ll get judged too; and however ya measure stuff, well, it’s gonna come right back atcha.
Now why in the world you lookin’ at that speck in your buddy’s eye when ya ain’t even payin’ attention to that big ol' log in your own?
Or how you fixin’ to tell your friend: Let me get that speck outta your eye—when you got a whole dang beam stickin’ outta yours?
You hypocrite! First, get that beam outta your own eye; then you’ll be able to see clear enough to help your brother with his speck.
Don’t be throwin' around what’s holy to the dogs, and don’t be givin' your pearls to pigs, or they’ll just walk all over 'em and come back to bite ya.
Ask, and it’ll be given to ya; seek, and you’re gonna find; knock, and the door’s gonna open up for ya.
Every single person that asks gets something; the one who seeks will find; and the one who knocks, well, that door's comin’ right open.
Now, tell me, what kinda man among you, if his son asks for bread, is gonna hand him a rock?
Or if the boy asks for fish, is he gonna give him a snake?
If y’all, bein’ the way ya are, know how to give good gifts to your kiddos, how much more will your Father in Heaven give good stuff to them that ask Him?
So, whatever ya want folks to do to ya, you go on and do it for them too, ‘cause that there’s the law and the prophets rolled up in one.
Go on in through the narrow gate; ‘cause the wide gate and easy path lead straight to trouble, and lots of folks goin' that way.
‘Cause the gate’s narrow and the way’s tight leadin’ to life, and there’s only a handful that’s gonna find it.
Watch out for them false prophets, comin’ at ya lookin’ all fluffy like sheep, but deep down, they’s ravenous wolves.
You’ll know ‘em by their fruits. Do folks pick grapes off thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?
Just like a good tree produces good fruit; but a bad tree? Well, it’s gonna produce nothin’ but rotten fruit.
A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a rotten tree ain’t gonna bear good fruit.
Every tree that ain’t givin’ good fruit is gonna get chopped down and tossed in the fire.
So remember, you’ll know ‘em by their fruits.
Not everyone who calls out to me, Lord, Lord, is gonna get in the Kingdom up in Heaven; it’s the ones who do what my Father wants who’ll see it.
Many folks will come to me on that day, sayin’: Lord, Lord, didn’t we predict the future in Your name, and cast out demons in Your name, and do a whole heap of wonders?
And I’ll tell ‘em straight up: I never knew ya; take a hike, you who do wrong.
So, anyone who hears these words of mine and puts ‘em into action, I’ll compare 'em to a wise man who built his house on a rock—
And the rain fell, the floods showed up, the winds blew and beat against that house; and it didn’t fall, ‘cause it was built on solid rock.
But everyone who hears these words of mine and don’t do ‘em? Well, I’d say they’re like a foolish man who built his house on sand—
And the rain fell, the floods came, the winds blew and beat on that house; and it went crashin’ down, and oh, what a great fall it was.
