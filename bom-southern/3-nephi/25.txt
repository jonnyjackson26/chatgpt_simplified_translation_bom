Well now, here comes that day that’s gonna burn hotter than a fire in an oven; them proud folks and all them wicked doers, they gonna be like dried grass, just a’burnin’ up—ain’t nothin’ gonna be left, says the Big Guy upstairs.
But for y’all who hold fear for my name, the Son of Righteousness is gonna shine down with some healing, like a coon dog waggin' its tail; and y'all gonna go out like happy calves just a’runin’ round in the barn.
And y’all are gonna stomp all over them wicked folks, ‘cause they gonna be nothin’ but ashes under your boots when I decide to take care of this, says the Lord of Hosts.
Don’t you forget that law of Moses, my good ol’ servant, which I laid down for him way back in Horeb for all of Israel, with all the rules and regulations.
Lookie here, I’m gonna send you Elijah the prophet before that big ol’ dreadful day of the Lord rolls in;
And he’s gonna turn the hearts of the daddies to their kids, and the kids back to their daddies, or else I might just come in and bring a curse on this here earth.
