Well, lemme tell ya how it went down: Jesus went ahead and told the crowd to hush up on them prayers, and he told his disciples to keep prayin' in their hearts.
Then he said to ‘em, "Y’all get up on your feet!" And sure enough, they stood right up.
Next thing ya know, he broke some bread again, blessed it, and shared it with his disciples. 
After they had their fill, he told ‘em to break bread and pass it out to all the folks gatherin' ‘round. 
Then, after that, he was passin' out wine for 'em to drink, and told ‘em to share it with the crowd too.
Now, I gotta tell ya, them disciples didn’t bring no bread or wine for anyone; neither did the folks out there.
But he sure did give ‘em some bread to eat and some wine to drink, that’s for sure.
He said to ‘em, "Now listen here, eatin’ this bread is like eatin’ my body for your soul, and drinkin’ this wine is like drinkin’ my blood for your soul. You’ll never be hungry or thirsty again; you’ll be filled right up."
Well, once everybody had ate and drunk, they got filled with the Spirit; and they all started shoutin' together, givin’ glory to Jesus, whom they could see and hear.
And after they done praised Jesus, he told ‘em, "Now look here, I’m finishin’ up what the Father told me about y’all, who are a remnant of Israel."
Y’all remember I spoke to ya and said when Isaiah’s words come to pass—well, they’re written right here, you got ‘em laid out in front of ya, so go on and search ‘em.
And I’m tellin’ ya straight up, once they get fulfilled, that’s when the covenant the Father made with his people, you folks of Israel, comes to be.
Then the leftovers, scattered all over this earth, gonna be gathered up from the east, the west, the south, and the north; and they gonna learn ‘bout the Lord their God, who done redeemed ‘em.
And the Father told me I should hand over this land to you, for y’alls inheritance.
Now, if them Gentiles don’t get right after all the blessin' they gonna get, after scatterin’ my people—
Y’all, being the remnant of Jacob, will be sent among 'em; and you’ll be like lions among the beasts of the forest, and like young lions messin' up flocks of sheep, causin’ a ruckus, and nobody gonna save ‘em from it.
Your hand will be raised against your foes, and all your enemies gonna be cut off.
I’ll gather up my folks together just like a farmer gathers his sheaves on the floor.
For I’m gonna make my people, who have made a deal with the Father, strong as iron and tough as brass. Y’all gonna take down many folks, and I’ll make sure their stuff goes to the Lord, for He runs the whole earth. And just know, it’s me makin’ it happen.
And it’s comin’ that the sword of my justice will hang over ‘em that day; and unless they repent, it’s gonna smack ‘em good, says the Father, yes, even all them Gentile nations.
And I reckon I’ll set up my people, you house of Israel.
And oh look, I’m gonna set this people up right here in this land, fulfilling the covenant I made with your daddy Jacob; and it’ll be a New Jerusalem, with the powers of heaven right in the middle of y’all; yes, I’ll be hangin’ out with you too.
Now behold, I’m the one Moses was talkin’ 'bout, sayin’, "The Lord your God gonna raise up a prophet from among your own people, like me; listen to every word he says." And mark my words, if anybody don’t listen to that prophet, they gonna be cut off from the people.
I’m tellin’ ya, all the prophets, from Samuel on down, they all been talkin’ ‘bout me.
And just look at y’all, you’re the kids of them prophets; you come from Israel and y’all are part of that covenant the Father made with your daddies, sayin’ to Abraham that in your seed, all the folks of the earth gonna be blessed.
The Father raised me up first for y’all, sent me to bless ya by turnin’ ya away from your sins, ‘cause you’re the kids of the promise—
And once y’all been blessed, then the Father gonna keep his promise with Abraham, sayin’: In your seed, all the folks of the earth gonna be blessed—comin’ through me with the Holy Ghost bein’ poured out on the Gentiles, and that blessed them strong, scatterin’ my people, you house of Israel.
Y’all gonna be a scourge for the folks of this land. But hey now, once they get the fullness of my gospel, if they harden their hearts against me, I’ll just bounce their sins right back to ‘em, says the Father.
And I ain’t forgettin’ the covenant I made with my people; I promised I’d gather ‘em up in my own time, and give ‘em back their dad’s land for their inheritance, which is Jerusalem, the land promised unto ‘em forever, says the Father.
And it’s gonna come to pass when the fullness of my gospel gets preached to ‘em;
And they’ll believe in me as Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and pray to the Father in my name.
Then their watchmen gonna lift up their voices, and they’ll sing together; for they gonna see eye to eye.
Then the Father gonna gather ‘em back up and hand ‘em Jerusalem for their inheritance.
Then they gonna burst into joy—sing together, y’all barren spots of Jerusalem; 'cause the Father done comforted his people, and he’s redeemed Jerusalem.
The Father’s flexed his holy arm in front of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth gonna see the salvation from the Father; me and the Father are one.
And it’s gonna come to pass, like it’s written: Wake up, wake up again, and put on your strength, O Zion; put on your pretty clothes, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for from now on, ain’t nobody uncircumcised or unclean gonna get in here.
Shake off that dust; rise up, sit down, O Jerusalem; free yourself from them bands ‘round your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
‘Cause the Lord says: You done sold yourselves for nothin', but you’ll be bought back without no cash.
I’m tellin’ you the honest truth, my people gonna know my name; yeah, on that day, they’ll see I’m the one speakin’.
And y’all gonna say: How beautiful are the feet of them that bring good news on the mountains, that shout ‘bout peace; that bring good tidings of good, shoutin’ about salvation; that tells Zion: Your God reigns!
Then there gonna be a shout: Get outta here, get outta here, leave that place; don’t touch anything unclean; get outta her midst; be clean that holds the vessels of the Lord.
You won’t need to rush out or take flight; the Lord gonna go before ya, and the God of Israel gonna have your back.
Now look, my servant gonna be smart about things; he’s gonna be lifted up and honored and real high.
Many folks gonna be shocked at him—his appearance was so messed up, more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—
So he gonna sprinkle many nations; kings gonna be speechless ‘cause they gonna see what they never heard before.
I’m tellin’ you, all this is surely comin’, just like the Father commanded me. Then this covenant the Father made with his people gonna get fulfilled; and Jerusalem gonna be livin' again with my people, and it’ll be their inheritance.
