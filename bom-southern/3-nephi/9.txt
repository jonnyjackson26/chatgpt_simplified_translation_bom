Well, it done got real quiet ‘round here, and a voice can be heard by folks all over this land, hollerin’:
Woe, woe, woe to this here people; woe to everyone on this ol' earth unless they get to repentin’; 'cause the devil's laughin’, and his little demons are throwin’ a party 'cause of all the lost good folks, the mighty fine sons and daughters of mine. They done fell 'cause of their nasty ways and all them awful deeds!
Y’all listen up, I done burned that big ol’ city Zarahemla down to the ground, and everyone in it.
And that big city Moroni? Yep, I sunk that sucker down deep in the sea, and folks there drowned like fish outta water.
And look here, that big ol' city Moronihah, I covered it up good with dirt, and the folks in it, too, just to hide their wicked ways and stanky deeds from my sight, so the blood of my prophets and good folks won’t come crying to me no more ‘gainst 'em.
And let me tell ya, I sunk the city of Gilgal right down deep, and all 'em folks are buried in the ground;
Uh-huh, and don’t forget 'bout the city of Onihah and all its people, and the city of Mocum with its folks, and that city of Jerusalem, too; I done made the waters rise up in their place to cover up their dirty deeds, so the blood of my prophets and good folks won’t come crying to me 'gainst 'em no more.
And there’s the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and the city of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all ‘a them I sunk down in the ground, turned 'em into hills and valleys, and buried the folks deep, so’s their wickedness and bad deeds can’t come to my ears again.
Now listen, that big city Jacobugath, where King Jacob’s folks were hangin’ out, I set it ablaze ‘cause they was as wicked as they come, worse than all the evil in a’ the land, what with their sneak murders and hush-hush alliances; they done ruined the peace of my people and messed up the whole place, so I burned 'em up real good, to keep ‘em from comin’ to me 'gain with all that blood on their hands.
And that city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen? I done burned 'em to ashes, and their people, too, ‘cause they kicked out the prophets and stoned the ones I sent to warn ‘em 'bout their nasty ways and all them evil things.
And since they kicked out every last one of 'em, not a single soul righteous in sight, I rained down fire and wiped 'em clean, hidin’ all that wickedness from my view, so the blood of my prophets and good folks who tried to help 'em wouldn’t go cryin’ out against 'em no more.
I done caused a whole heap of destruction to come down on this land and its people, all 'cause of their wickedness and their stanky deeds.
O all you who are left standin' 'cause ya ain’t as bad as they are, why don’t ya come back to me, and give up them sins, and get right with me, 'cause I wanna heal ya?
I mean it, y’all listen now, if ya come to me, I promise you’ll find everlasting life. Lookee here, my arms of mercy are wide open for ya, and whoever wants to come, I’ll welcome ‘em right in; blessed are all y’all who come to me.
Now I’m Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I made the heavens and the earth and everything in ‘em. I was with the Father from the very start. The Father’s in me, and I'm in the Father; it’s in me where the Father’s name gets glorified.
I came to my own folks, but they turned me away. And all them scriptures ‘bout my coming? Well, they done come to pass.
And to all who’ve taken me in, I give 'em the chance to be sons of God; and I’ll do the same for anyone who believes in my name, 'cause through me, redemption’s here, and in me, the law of Moses is all wrapped up.
I’m the light and the life of this world. I’m the Alpha and the Omega, the very beginning and the end.
Y’all ain’t gotta keep spillin’ blood no more for me; nope, your ol’ sacrifices and burnt offerings ain’t needed no more, 'cause I’m not gonna accept any of 'em.
What I want for a sacrifice is a broken heart and a spirit that’s humble. And anyone who comes to me with a broken heart and that contrite spirit? I’ll baptize ‘em with fire and the Holy Ghost, just like them Lamanites who had faith in me when they changed their ways, and they didn’t even know it.
Look here, I’ve come to this world to bring redemption, to save folks from their sins.
So who-so-ever repents and comes to me like a little child, I’ll take 'em in, 'cause that’s who gets the kingdom of God. I laid down my life for them, then picked it back up; so repent and come to me, you ends of the earth, and let’s get you saved.
