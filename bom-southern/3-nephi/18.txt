Well, let me tell ya, Jesus told them disciples to rustle up some bread 'n wine for Him.
And while they was fetchin' that bread 'n wine, He told the crowd to sit down on the good ol' ground.
Once them disciples came back with the bread 'n wine, He took the bread, broke it up, blessed it like a Sunday meal, and handed it out to the disciples, tellin' 'em to eat up.
After they filled their bellies, He told 'em to share with the crowd.
Once the crowd had their fill, He told the disciples: Y'all gotta pick one of you to be ordained, and I'll give him the power to break bread, bless it, and hand it out to my church folks, all those who believe and get baptized in my name.
And this here’s somethin' y’all always gotta stick to, just like I done, breakin' bread and blessin' it and givin' it to ya.
Y’all gotta do this in memory of my body, which I done showed you. It'll be a testament to the Father that y'all always remember me. And if ya keep me in your hearts, my Spirit will be with you.
Now, when He said this, He told the disciples to take that cup o' wine and drink it, and to hand it out to the crowd too.
So they did just that, drank up and got filled, givin' it to the crowd who likewise drank and got their fill.
After the disciples done all this, Jesus told 'em: Y’all are blessed for what ya done here, 'cause this fulfills my commands, and it shows the Father you're willin' to follow what I told ya.
And this is what you gotta do for folks who repent and get baptized in my name; do it in memory of my blood, which I shed for you, so you can show the Father that you're always rememberin' me. And if you do that, my Spirit will be right there with ya.
And I’m givin' ya a commandment to do these things. If ya keep doin' these, y'all will be blessed, 'cause you're built on my rock.
But if any of ya stray too far from this, ain't built on my rock, you're on shaky ground; and when that rain comes pourin', and the floods rise up, and the winds start howlin’, you’re gonna fall, 'cause the gates of hell are lookin’ to welcome ya.
So y’all be blessed if ya keep my commandments, the ones the Father gave me to hand on to ya.
Listen here, I’m serious when I say ya gotta watch and pray all the time, or else that ol’ devil's gonna get ya, leadin' ya off like a sheep strayin' from the herd.
Just like I’ve prayed amongst ya, y’all should pray in my church, among my folks who repent and get baptized in my name. I’m the light, and I’ve set an example for ya.
Now when Jesus finished speakin' to His disciples, He turned back to the crowd and said:
Listen up, I say it again, you gotta watch and pray all the time to avoid temptations; 'cause that ol' Satan's itchin' to have ya, lookin' to sift ya like wheat.
So y’all need to always pray to the Father in my name;
And whatever ya ask the Father in my name—if it’s right and you truly believe it'll happen—well then it’ll be given to ya.
Pray with your family to the Father, always in my name, so your wives and kids can be blessed.
And listen, y’all should get together often; don't be turnin' folks away when they come to see ya, but let 'em come on in and don’t push 'em away;
But make sure you pray for 'em, don’t be kickin' 'em out; and if they come around a lot, you better pray for 'em to the Father, in my name.
So hold up that light so it shines for the world to see. I’m that light which y’all should hold up—that’s what I’ve shown ya. Y’all see me prayin' to the Father, and y’all been witnessin' it too.
You know I’ve told ya that none of ya should be goin’ off alone, but rather come to me, so you can feel and see; that's how y’all should act towards the world; and if anyone breaks this commandment, they're just walkin' on a slippery slope into temptation.
Now it came to pass that after Jesus said all this, He turned His eyes back to those disciples He had picked and said to ‘em:
Listen up, I’m givin' ya another commandment, and then I gotta go to my Father to fulfill the other commands He’s given me.
Now pay attention, here’s the commandment I’m givin' ya: don’t let nobody knowingly partake of my flesh and blood if they ain't worthy, when y’all are ministerin' it;
‘Cause whoever eats and drinks my flesh and blood unworthily, well, they’re just eatin' and drinkin' damnation unto their own souls; so if ya know someone ain't worthy to partake, you gotta stop 'em.
But don’t just throw ‘em out, y’know, you still gotta minister to 'em and pray for 'em to the Father, in my name; and if they repent and get baptized in my name, then y’all can receive ‘em and minister to ‘em with my flesh and blood.
But if they don’t repent, well, they can't be counted among my folks, 'cause I don't want nobody destroyin' my people; 'cause I know my sheep, and they’re numbered.
But hey, don’t kick ‘em out of your gatherings or places of worship; keep ministerin' to them, 'cause ya don't know—they might come back, repent, and return to me with a full heart, and I’ll heal ‘em; and you’ll have played a part in bringin' 'em salvation.
So keep these words I’ve told ya, so you don't end up under condemnation; ‘cause woe to anyone the Father condemns.
And I'm givin' ya these commandments 'cause there’s been some quarrels among y’all. Blessed are ya if y'all ain’t got no squabbles goin' on.
Now I’m headin' to the Father, 'cause it’s what's best for you that I go.
And it came to pass that when Jesus finished these words, He laid hands on each of the disciples He chose, one by one, until He had touched 'em all, and spoke to ‘em personally.
And the crowd didn’t hear the words He said, so they didn’t take note; but the disciples made sure to record that He gave 'em power to bestow the Holy Ghost. And let me tell ya, I’ll show y’all later that this record is true.
Once Jesus touched 'em all, a cloud came down and overshadowed the crowd so they couldn’t see Him no more.
And while they was in that cloud, He slipped away from ‘em and ascended up to heaven. And the disciples saw it and made sure to write that He went up again to heaven.
