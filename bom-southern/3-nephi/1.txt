Well, let me tell ya, this here Nephi business starts back in the day of Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, the son of Alma—a whole family tree so thick you could get lost in it. We’re talkin’ about Nephi, the one who came from Lehi, who hightailed it outta Jerusalem right when Zedekiah started runnin’ things in Judah.
Now Nephi, Helaman’s boy, took off from these parts, leavin’ his eldest son Nephi in charge of keepin’ the records—meanwhile, folks were up to no good, plottin’ to get rid of the good folks. Then comes the night when Christ was born—signs all over the place, and a brand new star shinin’ bright. Meanwhile, lies and deceit were risin’ like bread in the oven, and them Gadianton robbers was causin’ quite the ruckus, spillin' blood like it was goin’ outta style. That’s ‘round A.D. 1 to 4, y’all.
You see, the ninety-first year slid on by, and it had been six hundred years since Lehi made his getaway from Jerusalem; it was also the year that Lachoneus was runnin’ the show as the chief judge and governor over the land.
Well, Nephi, Helaman’s son, skedaddled outta Zarahemla, passin’ the baton to his firstborn Nephi. He told him ‘bout the brass plates and all the records they’d kept safe since Lehi packed up and left.
Then Nephi took off from the land, and where he went, nobody’s figured out yet; but his boy Nephi kept the records in his place—yep, the whole saga of this folks.
Now right in the dusty start of the ninety-second year, lo and behold, those prophecies started comin’ true more and more. Folks was seein’ them big ol’ signs and miracles happen close to home.
But then there was a crowd startin’ to yap ‘bout how the time had slipped on by for Samuel’s words to be true.
So they was gettin’ all giddy over their buddies, shoutin’, “Looky here, time’s run out and Samuel’s words didn’t show up; your joy and faith is all for nothin’.”
And sure enough, they made a mighty commotion all over town; the folks who still believed were feelin’ down in the dumps, afraid them prophecies was just hot air.
But they was watchin’ real close for that one day—that day and night rolled into one—in hopes to see their faith wasn’t just wishful thinkin’.
Now there was a group of doubters who set a date to snuff out all them believers unless that sign showed itself, the one spoken by Samuel the prophet.
When Nephi, Nephi’s boy, saw the wickedness around him, his heart felt heavier than a sack of rocks.
So he hit the dirt, bowin’ down and callin’ out to God for his people, them fixin’ to get wiped out just ‘cause they believed in their elders’ ways.
He was hollerin’ to the Lord all day long; then the Lord’s voice came to him, sayin’:
“Lift your chin and cheer up, ‘cause the moment’s comin'; tonight the sign’s gonna show, and come sunrise, I’m showin’ up to let the world know I’ll do everythin’ my holy prophets been talkin’ ‘bout.”
“Looky here, I’m comin’ home to carry out all them things I told folks since the creation of the world, followin’ the will of both my Father and myself—of the Father ‘cause of me, and of the Son ‘cause of my human side. And trust me, the moment’s here, and tonight that sign is comin’.”
Sure enough, what the Lord told Nephi came to pass just as promised; when the sun set, there was no darkness at all, and folks were scratchin’ their heads ‘cause it didn’t look like night when it rolled in.
Now many who hadn’t believed in the prophets fell flat on their faces like they were knocked out, realizin’ that the grand scheme of destruction they had set up for the believers got turned on its head; that sign was already here.
They started to understand that the Son of God was fixin’ to show up any minute now; in fact, every last soul on this big ol’ earth from the west to the east, up north and down south, was so shocked they took a tumble to the ground.
‘Cause they knew them prophets had been preachin’ this stuff for years, and now that sign was right in front of 'em; fear hit ‘em hard ‘cause they could see their sins and doubts straight in the eye.
And it was a sight to behold that night—no darkness at all, just clear as a bell like it was high noon. Come mornin’, the sun rose all proper-like; they knew deep down it was the day the Lord was born ‘cause of that sign.
Everything happened just like the prophets said it would.
And it also turned out there was a bright new star shinin’, just like the word said.
Then, from that point onward, them lies started slippin’ in like a snake among the folks, puttin’ calluses on their hearts so they wouldn’t believe the signs and wonders right before their eyes; but despite them lies, most of the folks still believed and turned their hearts to the Lord.
Nephi went out among the people, along with plenty others, baptizin’ folks who wanted to turn away from their sins, and boy, there was a whole lotta forgiveness goin’ on. So the people started to settle down and find peace again in the land.
Now there wasn’t much fussin’ goin’ on, ‘cept for a handful tryin’ to preach that it wasn’t necessary to keep the law of Moses. Well, they got it wrong, not catchin’ the real gist of the scriptures.
But it didn’t take long before they turned around and realized they had been missin’ the point; they found out the law hadn’t been fulfilled yet, and it was gonna be fulfilled right down to the last dot and dash; so, that very year, they were made aware of their mistakes and came clean ‘bout their wrongdoings.
And that ninety-second year wrapped up with good news for the folks, all ‘cause of them signs that came true, just like the holy prophets had said.
Then the ninety-third year strolled on by peaceful-like, ‘cept for them Gadianton robbers settin’ up camp in the hills, causin’ a world of trouble; them folks was so dug in that no one could take ‘em on, and they was gettin’ away with all kinds of murder and mayhem among the people.
By the time the ninety-fourth year rolled ‘round, things got a whole lot worse ‘cause a big crowd of dissenters from the Nephites ran off to join those robbers, bringin’ heartache to the Nephites who stayed put.
And the Lamanites were feelin' it too; they had a heap of kids growin’ up and turnin’ into strong young’uns, and some of ‘em got led astray by them Zoramites with their sweet-talk and lies, joinin’ right up with the Gadianton crowd.
So the Lamanites took their hits too, startin’ to lose their faith and goodness ‘cause of the wickedness of them young’uns risin’ up.
