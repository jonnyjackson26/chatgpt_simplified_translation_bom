Well now, lemme tell ya, there was some wild weather goin' on—tempests, earthquakes, fires, whirlwinds, and a whole lotta ruckus that just showed what happened when Christ was crucified. Folks was gettin' wiped out left and right, and for three whole days, it was as dark as a coal mine out there. Them that was left was fussin' and complainin' 'bout their sorry state. Now we're talkin' A.D. 33-34.
So, here's the deal— according to our records (and we sure do believe 'em to be right), it was a good ol' boy who kept track of things, ‘cause he performed a whole mess of miracles in Jesus's name. Ain't nobody could pull off a miracle in Jesus's name unless they was cleansed from their sins.
Now, if this feller didn’t mess up takin' count of the years, then the thirty-third year done slipped right on by.
Folks started watchin' real close for that sign that the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, talked about, ya know—waitin' for that spell of darkness that was gonna hang around for three whole days across the land.
And boy, doubts was stirrin’ up like a kettle on the boil 'mongst the people, even with all them signs that had been shown.
Sure enough, in the thirty-fourth year, first month, on the fourth day, a storm like nobody had ever seen blew up, lettin' folks know it weren’t gonna be pretty.
And lemme tell ya, that tempest was somethin' fierce; the thunder roared so loud it felt like the whole earth was fixin' to tear apart.
Them lightnin' bolts struck so sharp and bright, ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like 'em in all the land.
Then you got the city of Zarahemla catchin' fire like it was doused in kerosene.
And the city of Moroni? Well, it just sank right down into the sea, takin' all its folks with it.
The ground got lifted up over in Moronihah, and where the city once stood, a big ol' mountain rose up.
Down south, things got real ugly with a heap of destruction.
But hold your horses—up north, it was way worse; the whole place changed thanks to that storm, whirlwinds, thunder, lightnin’, and the earth shakin’ like a rattlesnake.
The roads got torn up, smooth places turned rough, and a whole bunch of mighty cities got sunk or burned, leavin’ their people dead and the land desolate.
A few cities hung on, but oh boy, they were in bad shape, and many good folks bit the dust.
Some folks got swept off in the whirlwind, and where they ended up, nobody knows—not even they do.
And just like that, the whole earth's face looked all kinds o' messed up ‘cause of the storms, thunder, lightnin’, and earth quakin’.
Rocks got split right in half, all broken up like an old road, scattered across the land in bits and pieces.
Then, after some three hours of booming thunder, crackin' lightnin', stormin', tempestuous weather, and earth quakin', it all came to a stop—just like that. Folks said it mighta been longer, but all them great and terrible events took place in 'round three hours, and then it was dark as night all over.
Thick darkness rolled in real heavy over the land, so folks who hadn’t fallen could feel the darkness like a damp blanket.
There wasn’t a flicker of light to be found—not candles, not torches, nada. Folks couldn’t even get a fire goin' with their dry wood, no light at all.
No light showed up, whether it was fire, glow, sun, moon, or stars—just thick mists of darkness coverin' the land.
And this darkness held tight for three whole days—no light anywhere to be seen. Mourning, wailing, and crying filled the air as folks grieved, and man, the groans of people echoed real loud ‘cause of the darkness and the awful destruction they faced.
In one spot, folks was heard cryin', "If only we’d repented before this dreadful day, our kin mighta been spared and not burned up in that big ole city of Zarahemla."
And in another place, the cries went up, "If only we’d turned our hearts 'round before this terrible day, not killed and shunned the prophets, our mamas, our fair daughters, and our little ones might still be with us, and not buried up in that great city of Moronihah." And the wailin’ of the people was truly somethin' to behold.
