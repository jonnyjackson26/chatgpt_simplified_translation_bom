Well now, it sure did come to pass that all them Nephites packed up and headed back to their own homesteads in that twenty-sixth year, every man grabbin’ his family, critters, and all his possessions—horses, cattle, you name it, he brought it along.
And wouldn’t ya know, they hadn’t gobbled up all their supplies, so they loaded up everything they hadn’t scarfed down, all kinds of their grain, gold, silver, and all sorts of fine stuff, and they made their way back to their lands and all their goods, both up north and down south, everywhere they called home.
Now, they went ahead and did a favor for them robbers who agreed to keep the peace, the ones wishin' to stay Lamanites, givin' 'em plots o' land based on how many folks they had, so they could work hard and make a livin’; and that’s how they set up peace across the whole place.
Next thing ya know, they started thrivin’ real good, and them twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh years rolled on by, and there was a mighty fine order all around; they made their laws fair and square too.
Ain't nothin' gonna get in the way of folks doin' well ‘cept they go messin’ up and fallin’ off the path.
And it was that Gidgiddoni fella, along with the judge Lachoneus and them leaders they picked, that got this big peace movin’ in the land.
It came to be that they built lots of new towns, and some of the old ones got all spruced up too.
They went ahead and paved a whole bunch of roads and paths that linked up them cities, givin' folks a way to travel from place to place.
And just like that, the twenty-eighth year passed on by, and folks enjoyed a stretch of peace without much ruckus.
But when the twenty-ninth year rolled in, folks started bickering a bit; some got all puffed up with pride and braggin’ 'bout their big ol’ piles of gold and silver, even leadin’ to some mean persecution.
See, there was a whole boatload o’ merchants around, along with a flock of lawyers and plenty of officials.
Folks started givin' themselves titles based on how rich they were and what they knew; some didn’t have much smarts 'cause they were broke, while others who were loaded got real wise.
Some folks strutted around all high and mighty, while others stayed real humble; some tossed back insults, while others took it all, not fighting back but stayin’ low and sorry before God.
That’s when you could see a big ol’ gap growing in the land, and the church started to fall apart; by the thirtieth year, it was all but gone ‘cept for a handful of Lamanites who found true faith and stuck to it, bein’ steady and determined to follow the Lord’s commandments.
Now, the root of all this mess was plain—Satan had a strong hold, stirrin’ folks up to do all sorts of bad deeds, puffin’ 'em up with pride, and temptin’ 'em to chase after power, respect, and all that flashy stuff in this world.
So, Satan led the hearts of the people to stray; they had a taste of peace, but it didn't last long.
At the start of that thirtieth year, folks had been tossed 'round by the devil’s tricks for a good while, doin’ whatever wickedness he led 'em to, and by the kick-off of this year, they was knee-deep in trouble.
Now, they ain’t sinning outta ignorance, ‘cause they understood what God wanted from ‘em since it was taught clear as day; they chose to rebel anyway.
And this here was in the days of Lachoneus, son of Lachoneus, who took his daddy’s place and was runnin’ the show that year.
Then folks who were inspired from on high started poppin’ up ‘mongst the people everywhere, preachin’ loud and clear about the folks’ sins and pointing out how the Lord’s gonna redeem his people, which is to say, talkin’ ‘bout Christ's resurrection, and they sure weren’t shy about remindin’ folks about His suffering and death.
Well, a whole bunch of folks got real mad at them who were shoutin’ about these truths; the ones who got all riled up were mainly the top judges and them high priests and lawyers—yep, all them lawyers were upset with them truth-tellers.
Now, there ain’t no lawyer, judge, or high priest that could send anyone to the gallows unless the governor of the land gave the green light.
But you see, a whole lotta folks yellin’ about Christ were put to death in secret by them judges, and nobody even told the governor what happened until it was all over.
Now, lemme tell ya, that was against the laws of the land; no man should be put to death ‘less the governor had givin' the order first— 
So, a complaint made its way to Zarahemla, gettin’ to the governor about them judges who had sentenced the Lord’s prophets to die, and it sure wasn’t followin’ the law.
Next thing you know, they were rounded up and put on trial for the crimes they committed, to be judged by the laws the people had put in place.
But them judges had a heap of friends and family; and nearly all them lawyers and high priests banded together with the kin of them judges who were about to face the music.
So they made a pact together, joinin’ in on an old covenant, one that had been set by the devil, to band against all that was good and right.
So they teamed up against the Lord’s people and plotted to wipe 'em out, trying to get the murderers off the hook from facing justice, which was fixin’ to be served up according to the law.
They thumbed their noses at the law and the rights of their land, and they made a pact to take out the governor and put a king in charge instead, so that land would never be free again but instead, be ruled by kings.
