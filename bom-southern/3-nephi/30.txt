Y’all listen up now, ‘cause I got some words from Jesus Christ, the Good Lord’s own son, and he’s told me to share this right here with ya. 
Now, y’all better turn away from them sinful ways and quit all that wickedness, toss aside them lies and trickery, and stop them shenanigans, and all them hidden sins, and get outta that idol mess, and leave all that murdering alone, and stop playin’ preacher for your own gain, and let go of them jealous feelings, and quit stirrin’ up trouble, and just leave all that bad stuff behind, and come on over to me, and get yourself baptized in my name so ya can wash away them sins, and get filled up with the Holy Ghost, so ya can be counted among my folks, the good people from the house of Israel.
