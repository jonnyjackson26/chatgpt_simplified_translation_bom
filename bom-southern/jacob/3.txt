Well, lemme tell ya, the folks who got good hearts, they sure gonna take in them sweet words from the Good Lord—now the Lamanites, they got more good in ‘em than them Nephites—Jacob’s fixin’ to warn folks ‘bout messin’ around, livin’ lasciviously, and all kinds of sinful ways. Now we talkin’ ‘bout a time ‘round 544–421 B.C.
But hey y’all, I’m Jacob, and I got some words for them of y’all with clear hearts. Set your minds on God and pray real hard, ‘cause if ya do, He’ll be there to comfort ya when the struggle’s rough, and He’ll stand up for ya against those fixin' to bring ya down.
Hey there, all y’all with good hearts, lift up them heads and soak in the sweet words of God; feast on His love too; if you keep your minds steady, it’ll last ya forever.
But whoa, whoa, y’all who ain’t pure at heart, and filthy as a hog today in God’s eyes; if you don’t turn away from that, the land’s gonna be cursed ‘cause of you; them Lamanites, they ain’t dirty like y’all, but they still cursed hard, and they gonna bring you to ruin.
And let me tell ya, the time’s comin’ fast when if y’all don’t repent, they gonna take over your land, and God Almighty will guide the good folks right on outta your way.
Look at the Lamanites, your kin, whom y’all can’t stand ‘cause of what y’all see on their skins, but they’re more righteous than you; they didn’t forget the Lord’s command to have just one wife, no concubines, and no whorin' goin’ on.
And now, they’re keepin’ that commandment; ‘cause they do, God won’t lay waste to ‘em, but will show them mercy; one day, they’ll be a blessed bunch.
Now, their men love their women, and their women love their men; plus, they all love their little ones, and if they hold a grudge against you, well that’s ‘cause of what their daddies did. So, how much better are y’all in the eyes of the big guy upstairs?
Brothers, I’m worried that if y’all don’t change your ways, when we all stand before God, their skins might be whiter than yours.
So here’s a word from God: y’all best not be hatin’ on ‘em just ‘cause of the color of their skin; don’t bring ‘em down for bein’ dirty either; remember your own dirtiness, and know their mess comes from their forefathers.
So remember your young’uns, how y’all might’ve crushed their spirits ‘cause of how you act; and remember, your filthiness could send your kids spiralin’ down, and their sins gonna weigh heavy on your heads when it’s all over.
Brothers, listen to me; wake up your hearts; shake off that dead weight and shake loose from the grips of hell, or you might just end up bein’ angels for the devil, thrown into that lake of fire and brimstone, which is the second death, y’all.
And now, I’m Jacob, and I said a whole heap more to the Nephites, warnin’ ‘em against shacking up, livin’ wild, and all sorts of sinful ways, tellin’ ‘em the dreadful stuff that comes from that business.
And there’s no way to write down a hundredth of what this people was doin’, ‘cause they was startin’ to multiply, but plenty of their stories are scribbled on the bigger plates, like their battles and their squabbles, and the reigns of their kings.
These plates are known as Jacob’s plates, made by Nephi’s hand. And I reckon I’m done sayin’ all this here.
