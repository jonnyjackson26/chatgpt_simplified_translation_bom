Well now, listen up, y’all. I’m fixin’ to share a little somethin' that’s been prophesied—what that fella Zenos talked 'bout, likenin’ the house of Israel to a good ol' olive tree, it’s gonna happen, no doubt.
Now, the day the Lord rolls up his sleeves again to gather His folks back in is gonna be the very last time when His servants get to working real hard in the fields, tendin’ to His vineyard; after that, y’all best believe the end's just 'round the corner.
Ain’t no blessin’ quite like the ones who’ve toiled hard in that vineyard; and let me tell ya, it’s a sorry state for them that get tossed outta there! And heaven’s gonna rain down fire, folks.
Ain’t our God just a kind soul? He’s rememberin' His people, Israel, the roots and branches—they’re like a stubborn mule, but bless their hearts, those who keep their hearts soft will find their way into God’s kingdom.
So listen here, my dear friends, I’m implorin’ ya real serious-like to change your ways, come on back to God with all ya got, and stick close to Him like He sticks close to you. While God’s mercy is reachin’ out to ya during the daylight, don’t harden your hearts now.
I’m tellin’ ya, today, if y’all hear Him callin’, don’t shut your hearts up tight; what’s the point in just rollin’ over and dyin'?
Now, after you’ve been fed the good word of God all day long, how could you possibly bear bad fruit? If you do, you’ll get cut down and tossed into the fire.
So tell me, are ya gonna turn your back on these words? Are ya gonna ignore what the prophets had to say about Christ, after so many have shared their thoughts, and walk away from the good word of Christ, the power of God, and the Holy Ghost? Don’t go makin’ a joke of the grand plan of redemption that’s been laid out just for you.
Don’t you know that if you keep on down that road, the power of redemption and resurrection through Christ is gonna leave ya standin’ there full of shame and guilt before God’s judgment?
And reckonin’ God’s justice, which can’t be turned away, means you’ll be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone, burnin' hot and eternal, where them flames just keep on blazin’ and the smoke rises up forever.
So, I tell ya, my dear friends, turn away from your sins, slide right on through that narrow gate, and stick to that straight and narrow path till you grab hold of eternal life.
Now be smart, what else could I possibly say?
Lastly, I’m sayin’ goodbye for now, until we meet up at God’s doorstep, which sure strikes a chill in the hearts of the wicked. Amen.
