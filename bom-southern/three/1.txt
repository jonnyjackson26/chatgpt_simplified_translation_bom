Well, let me tell ya, folks across the way, listen up real good: We, by the good grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, done seen them plates that hold this here record, a record tellin' all 'bout the bunch of Nephites and their kin, the Lamanites, not to mention them folks from Jared, who hightailed it down from the tower folks been jawin' about. And we know for sure they've been translated by God's mighty hand, 'cause we heard His voice tellin' us so; that’s why we’re sure this here work is straight-up true. We also wanna say we laid eyes on them engravings on those plates; God showed 'em to us, not no man had a hand in it. We're tellin' ya true, we saw an angel from heaven come down, and He brought 'em right before our eyes, and we gawked at the plates and all them carvings on 'em; we reckon it’s by the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ that we saw and can vouch that these things are the real deal. And ain't it somethin' special? Still, the Lord's voice told us we got to bear witness to it; so, bein' good and obedient like, we’re givin’ our testimony of all this. And we reckon if we stay true to Christ, we’ll wash our hands clean of everybody else's mess, and we’ll come out squeaky clean when we stand before Christ’s judgment seat, and we’ll get to hang out with Him for all eternity up in heaven. And we’re givin’ all the glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are all one. Amen.
