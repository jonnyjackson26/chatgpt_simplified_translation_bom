One king takes over from another—some kings are good folks, while others are real no-gooders—when the good folks are in charge, the people get blessed and do well by the Lord.
So, there was this fella named Shez, he was kin to Heth—‘course Heth done gone away ‘cause of a famine, leavin’ just Shez to carry the torch—so, Shez got to work fixin’ up a broken crowd.
Well, Shez remembered how his folks had been wiped out, and he set out to build a decent kingdom; he didn’t forget how the Lord had helped Jared and his brother make it across that big ol’ ocean; he walked the path of the Lord and had himself some sons and daughters.
But his oldest boy, who was also named Shez, turned against him; still, that boy got himself hurt by a thief ‘cause of all that money weighin’ down his pockets, which ended up makin’ peace for his daddy again.
Then ol’ Shez built up a whole mess of cities all over the land, and folks started spreadin’ out again. He lived to be as old as dirt and had himself a boy named Riplakish before he passed away, and then Riplakish took over.
Well, Riplakish didn’t exactly do right by the Lord; he had a whole bunch of wives and concubines, and he sure piled up the burdens on folks, givin’ ‘em heavy taxes to pay; and with all that cash, he built up some fancy buildings.
He also got himself a downright gorgeous throne; built a pile of jails, too, and if anyone didn’t wanna pay their taxes, they found themselves behind bars; and if they couldn’t pay, you guessed it, straight to jail they went; he made ‘em work hard just to keep their heads above water; anyone who didn’t want to work, well they found a whole different fate.
So, he got all that fine work done, even had them refine his fine gold in prison; all sorts of fancy stuff was crafted there. This fella made sure to put folks through the wringer with his wickedness and vile acts.
After he ran the show for forty-two years, folks finally got fed up and stood up against him; and lo and behold, war broke out again, and Riplakish ended up bitin’ the dust, with his kin driven right out of the land.
Then, after a bunch of years gone by, Morianton, who also had Riplakish in his family tree, rounded up a whole gang of misfits and started fightin’ the people; he took over a heap of cities, and that war got real intense, lastin’ for ages; he took control over all the land and named himself king.
Once he wore that crown, he lightened the load on the folks, which made ‘em like him; they even anointed him as their king.
He brought justice for the folks, but he looked out for himself, not so much, ‘cause of all his wrongdoings; that’s why he got cut off from the Lord’s presence.
Well, Morianton went on to build a whole bunch of cities, and folks got rich under him, both with buildings and gold, silver, grain, livestock, you name it, they got back what they lost.
Morianton lived a long life, then had him a boy named Kim; Kim took over his daddy’s throne, ruled for eight years, and then Morianton died. But Kim didn’t quite rule fair, so the Lord wasn’t too fond of him.
His brother got all rebellious and put him in chains; that boy was stuck in captivity all his life, but he still had kids while he was there, and when he got old, he had himself a son named Levi; and then he passed on.
Levi ended up servin’ in chains after his daddy was gone for forty-two years; he made war against the king and ended up snaggin’ the kingdom for himself.
Once he was in charge, he did right by the Lord, and the folks thrived under his rule; he lived a good long life, had a bunch of kids, and even anointed his son Corom as king after him.
Corom did right by the Lord all his days, had himself plenty of kids, and after a good long while, he passed just like everyone else; then Kish took over from him.
Kish passed away too, and then Lib became king in his place.
And Lib too did what was right in the Lord’s eyes. In his time, them poisonous snakes got wiped out. So, they headed south to hunt for food for the people since the land was full of critters. Lib also turned into quite the hunter himself.
They built a big ol' city at the narrow part of land where the sea split it.
They saved the land down south as a wilderness for huntin’. And the northern part of the land ended up packed with people.
They was mighty diligent, buyin’ and sellin’, tradin’ back and forth to make a bit of profit.
They worked all kinds of ores, makin’ gold, silver, iron, brass, you name it; they dug it up and piled it high to get their metals, create work for themselves.
They had fancy silks and finely spun linens; they made all sorts of clothin’ to cover up their bodies.
They crafted all kinds of tools to farm the land, for plowin’ and sowin’, reaping and hoeing, and even thrashing.
And they whipped up tools for workin’ with their animals.
And made all sorts of weapons for war, creatin’ super detailed stuff.
Couldn’t nobody be more blessed than they was, and the hand of the Lord surely helped ‘em be prosperous. They was livin’ in a land that was mighty fine, just like the Lord said it would be.
Now, Lib lived a good while longer and had a passel of kids; he even had a boy named Hearthom.
Then Hearthom took his daddy’s seat, and when he ruled for twenty-four years, bam! That kingdom got snatched away from him. He spent the rest of his days in chains.
He fathered Heth, and Heth lived all his life in captivity. Heth had Aaron, and Aaron also spent his life in chains; then Aaron had himself a boy named Amnigaddah, who lived in captivity too; he had a son named Coriantum, and guess what? Coriantum stayed in captivity all his days too; then he had a boy named Com.
Then it came to pass that Com took half of the kingdom. He ruled that half for forty-two years and went to fight against King Amgid, and they tussled for a whole bunch of years, and during that time, Com got the upper hand on Amgid, takin’ control of the rest of the kingdom.
In Com’s days, bandits started poppin’ up in the land; they went back to the old tricks, makin’ oaths like they used to, and schemin’ again to bring the kingdom down.
But Com fought against ‘em a whole lot; still, he couldn’t quite win against ‘em.
