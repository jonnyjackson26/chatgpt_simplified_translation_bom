Well now, a whole mess of folks from the Jaredites got themselves slain in a right nasty battle—Shiz and Coriantumr rounded up everyone for a showdown—And wouldn’t ya know it, the Spirit of the Lord just up and quit tryin’ to help ‘em—That Jaredite nation was all but wiped out—Only Coriantumr was left standin’.
So, after Coriantumr got himself patched up from them wounds, he started thinkin’ ‘bout the words old Ether had laid on him.
He realized that nearly two million of his folks had bit the dust from the sword, and his heart was feelin’ heavy; yep, nearly two million strong men went down, along with their wives and little ones.
He started feelin’ real sorry for the wrongs he had done; he remembered those words the prophets had preached, and every single one of 'em was comin’ true, and his soul was just heavy and wouldn’t let up.
And it came to pass that he penned a letter to Shiz, askin’ him to show some mercy on the folks, and he’d just go ahead and give up his crown for the lives of ‘em.
Well, when Shiz got that letter, he fired back his own, sayin’ if Coriantumr would throw in the towel, he’d use his own sword to take him out but would spare the people.
Now, it came to pass that folks weren’t repentin’ for their wrongdoings; and Coriantumr’s people was all fired up at Shiz’s folks, while Shiz’s addled folks was just as mad at Coriantumr’s mob; so, Shiz’s gang was itchin’ for a fight with Coriantumr’s bunch.
And when Coriantumr saw the bus was about to leave without him, he hightailed it once more from Shiz's folk.
Then he found himself at the big waters of Ripliancum, which folks say means “really big,” so they set up camp there; and Shiz camped out nearby too, and come morning, they was all ready to rumble.
And wouldn’t ya know it, they had themselves a mighty rough scrap, and Coriantumr got himself hurt again, o’ course he fainted from losin’ all that blood.
And it came to pass that Coriantumr’s army pushed on Shiz’s boys so hard they had ‘em retreatin’; they went runnin’ south and camped at a spot called Ogath.
Then Coriantumr’s army set up camp by good ol’ hill Ramah; that’s the very hill where my dad Mormon stashed those sacred records for the Lord.
And it came to pass that they gathered up all the folks left on the ground who hadn’t been killed off, 'cept for Ether.
Then Ether watched all the goin’s on; he saw that all those folks hopin’ for Coriantumr were crowdin’ ‘round his army, and the ones rootin’ for Shiz was flockin’ to his side too.
So, for four long years, they were rustlin’ up all the folks who was still breathin’, tryin' to get every last one of ‘em on their side and gatherin’ all the strength they could muster.
And it came to pass that when they all came together, everyone heading to their own army with their kin—men, women, and young’uns all loadin’ up with weapons for war, sportin’ shields and breastplates and the whole bit—they marched against each other ready for a tussle; and they fought all day long without a winner.
And when night fell, they was all tuckered out and headed back to camp; after settlin’ down, they started a howlin’ and cryin’ for all the folks lost in battle; their wails echoed across the land louder than a pack of coyotes.
And it came to pass that come mornin’, they were back at it again, and boy, what a tough day that was; but still, they didn’t get the win, and when night fell once more, their cries and laments filled the air for all the ones they lost.
Then Coriantumr wrote Shiz another letter, askin’ him to not come at ‘em again, but to just take the throne and spare the lives of his folks.
But lo and behold, the Spirit of the Lord had up and stopped tryin’ to help ‘em, and ol’ Satan had a grip on their hearts; they was just too hard-headed and blind to see they was on the road to ruin, and they charged into battle again.
And it came to pass they fought all day long, and when darkness rolled in, they dropped down for a snooze on their swords.
And the next day they fought till the stars twinkled back up in the night sky.
And when night rolled around again, they was all fired up and angry, like a fella had too much moonshine; and they went back to sleep on them swords.
And the next day, they dove back into battle; but when darkness set in, all but fifty-two of Coriantumr’s fell, and sixty-nine of Shiz's went down too.
And it came to pass that they snoozed on their swords that night, and come mornin’, they was back at it again, swingin’ their swords and shields with all their might that whole day.
And as the night set in, there was thirty-two of Shiz's folk, and twenty-seven of Coriantumr's still standin’.
And it came to pass that they munched on some grub, got some sleep, and prepared for death comin’ on the morrow. And boy, were they a sight to behold, big and strong as an ox.
And it came to pass they fought for three long hours, and finally fainted from all the blood they’d lost.
And it came to pass that when Coriantumr's boys had muster enough strength to even move, they was fixin’ to run for their lives; but wouldn’t you know it, Shiz got back up, and his men too, swearin’ in his anger that he’d take Coriantumr down or die tryin’.
So, he chased ‘em down, and come morning, he caught up with ‘em again, and they was back at it with swords. It came to pass that when the dust settled, only Coriantumr and Shiz was left standin’, and Shiz had fainted from all that blood loss.
And it came to pass that when Coriantumr rested a moment on his sword, he took a swing and lopped off Shiz’s head.
And it came to pass that after he did that, Shiz raised himself up for just a second, then fell; he struggled to breathe a bit longer, and then he was gone.
And it came to pass that Coriantumr ended up on the ground, lookin’ like he was out of the game.
Then the Lord spoke to Ether, tellin’ him to get a move on. So he did, and saw that everything the Lord said had come to pass; and he finished up his record (though he didn’t write down a hundredth of it) and hid ‘em in a way that the folks of Limhi could find.
Now the last words left by Ether go like this: Whether the Lord wants me to be taken up, or whether I gotta face what He’s got in store for me here, don’t matter none, as long as I’m saved in His kingdom. Amen.
