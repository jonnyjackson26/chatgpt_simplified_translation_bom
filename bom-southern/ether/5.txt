Well, let me just say, those three folks who witnessed this whole shebang and the work itself sure will back up just how true the Book of Mormon is.
Now, I’m Moroni, and I’ve been scribblin’ down the stuff I was told to write, all from memory, ya know? And I’ve shared with ya the bits I sealed up tight, so don’t go messin’ with 'em lookin' to translate; that kind of thing’s a no-go unless it's real smart-like from God.
Now, y’all might just get lucky and get to show the plates to folks who’ll help bring this here work to light;
And God’s gonna let three of ‘em see it; they’ll know for sure that all this is true as the day is long.
And let me tell ya, the words of three witnesses will make all this plain as day, and their testimony, along with this work, shows off the mighty power of God and His words, just like the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost have testified—and all this will stand strong against the world come judgment day.
And if folks turn their ways and come to the Father in Jesus' name, they'll be welcomed right into God’s kingdom.
Now, if I ain't got no authority for all this, well, y’all can be the judge; you'll sure know I got the goods when you see me standin’ there before God on that last day. Amen.
