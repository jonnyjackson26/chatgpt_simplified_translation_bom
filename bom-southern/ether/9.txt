Well, let me tell ya, the kingdom sure does hop around from one folks to another, all 'cause o' sneaky business, envy, and good ol’ murder—Emer laid eyes on the Son of Righteousness—Plenty of prophets hollered about turnin’ from their sins—While a famine and some nasty snakes was givin’ folks a mighty tough time.
Now I, Moroni, gonna keep on with my story. So, it went like this—’cause them secret plotters Akish and his pals were up to no good, they managed to knock Omer right off the throne.
But the good Lord had mercy on Omer, his boys, and his gals who weren't tryin’ to do him in.
And the Lord sent Omer a dream tellin’ him to skedaddle outta that place; so, Omer packed up his fam and hightailed it outta there, travelin’ a good long while, passin’ by the hill of Shim, and swingin’ around where them Nephites got wiped out, headin’ east ‘til he found a spot called Ablom down by the sea. Settin' up camp there, him and his whole family, 'cept for Jared and his crew.
Well, wouldn’t ya know it, Jared got himself crowned king by the hands of wickedness; then he married off his daughter to Akish.
Then it happened that Akish couldn’t stand the sight of his father-in-law and got a mind to off him; he went to those he promised old oaths to, and before you know it, they had his father-in-law’s head while he was sittin’ up on his throne, holdin’ court with the folks.
Man, this wicked secret club spread so big it corrupted everybody; so there was Jared, murdered on his throne, and Akish took over just like that.
Soon enough, Akish got jealous of his own boy, so he threw him in the slammer and cut back his grub until he didn’t make it.
Now his brother Nimrah—oh, he was mighty mad at his daddy for what he done to his brother.
Nimrah got himself a small band of men, and they high-tailed it to join Omer.
Akish had himself more sons, and wouldn’t ya know, they charmed the folks real good, even though everyone promised to toe the line and do whatever Akish wanted.
Them Akish folks wanted riches, just like their daddy wanted power; so the boys of Akish dangled money out there and pulled most folks toward ‘em.
Then a big ol’ war broke out between Akish’s sons and Akish himself, lastin’ years and years, strippin’ nearly everyone from the kingdom, ’cept for thirty souls and them who ran off with Omer.
So, Omer got brought back to his family’s land.
Now Omer was gettin’ on up in years, but even so, he had himself a boy named Emer; and he anointed Emer king so he could sit in his spot.
Well, after givin' Emer the crown, Omer saw two years of peace before he passed on, full of days—many of ‘em rough and tough. Emer took over and followed right in Omer's footsteps.
The Lord started takin’ the curse away from the land, blessin’ Emer’s fam with heaps of prosperity; in only sixty-two years, they got themselves real strong and rich-like—
With all sorts of fruits, grains, fancy fabrics, gold, silver, and all them spoils;
And on top of that, they had all kinds of livestock—oxen, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, and a whole mess of critters useful for eatin’.
They also had horses and donkeys, and even elephants, cureloms, and cumoms—all of which were real handy, especially them elephants, cureloms, and cumoms.
So there ya go, the Lord was pouring his blessings all over this land, the best land of all, tellin’ folks if they took the land, it better be for the Lord, or they’d face his mighty wrath when they got ripe with wickedness.
Emer was all about judgin’ righteously till the end of his days; he had a whole mess of sons and daughters, and among them was Coriantum, who he anointed to take his place.
After makin’ Coriantum king, Emer lived four more years and saw peace settle in the land; he even laid eyes on the Son of Righteousness and reveled in those times, then passed on peacefully.
Well, Coriantum followed right in his daddy’s footsteps, buildin’ up a bunch of big ol’ cities, doin’ good by his people, all the while. But it took him a long while before he had any young’uns, waitin’ ‘til he was awfully old.
Then, sure enough, his wife passed away at the ripe ol’ age of a hundred and two. So, Coriantum, in his old age, found him a young wife and had him some kids; he lived to be a hundred and forty-two years old.
Then Coriantum had himself a boy named Com, who took up the crown after him; Com reigned for forty-nine years and had him a boy named Heth, along with some other kids.
But hold on tight, ‘cause folks spread out all over again, and wickedness crept back into the land, with Heth pickin’ up those old secret plans to do away with his daddy.
Then it happened that Heth took his father down, killin’ him with his own sword, and then he grabbed the crown for himself.
Prophets came around again, yellin’ for folks to repent and make way for the Lord, or they’d bring a curse on the land; shoot, they warned ‘em of a mighty famine that’d leave ‘em lost if they didn’t turn from their ways.
But them folks wouldn’t listen, tossin’ the prophets outta town; some they even tossed down pits to leave ’em to rot. And wouldn’t ya know, they did it all ‘cause King Heth commanded it.
Well, that led to a terrible drought settlin’ over the land, and folks began droppin’ off quick-like ‘cause there wasn’t no rain fallin’.
And then came them poisonous snakes, causin’ harm to plenty folks. Their herds took off runnin’ from them snakes southward to a place called Zarahemla by the Nephites.
A good many didn’t make it along the way, but some did escape down south.
Then the Lord stepped in, making them serpents stop their chase, blockin’ the paths so nobody could get through ‘em; any soul that tried to cross might just fall victim to them poisonous critters.
The people followed after the animals and gorged themselves on the carcasses of critters that fell along the way, until they cleaned ‘em out. Once they saw they were on the brink of perishing, folks started to repent of their wrongdoings and cried out to the Lord.
And it came to pass, when they finally humbled themselves enough before the Lord, He sent rain upon the earth; and the folks started to come back to life, with crops poppin’ up in the northern parts and all around. And the Lord showed off His power, keepin’ ‘em safe from hunger.
