Well, y’see, the folks’ wickedness put a mighty curse on the land—Coriantumr got himself in a whole heap of trouble fightin’ against Gilead, then Lib, and then Shiz—there was blood and mess all over the place.
Now, I reckon it started gettin’ pretty rough on the land 'cause of all them folks’ sins, where if a man just laid his tools or sword on the shelf or wherever he’d stash it, he’d wake up next mornin’ and it’d be gone—such was the curse all 'round.
So every fella clung tight to what was his, holdin’ onto it with both hands; nobody was borrowin’ or lendin’ nothin’. And all the men kept their swords ready in their right hands, protectin’ their stuff, their lives, and their kin.
Now, after a couple years went by and Shared kicked the bucket, his brother stood up and challenged Coriantumr. Well, that Coriantumr whipped him and chased him off to the wilds of Akish.
Then the brother of Shared went and threw down in the wilderness of Akish; that fight was real fierce, and a whole mess of folks met their maker by the sword.
So, Coriantumr laid siege 'round the wilderness, and that brother of Shared decided to sneak out at night to take a stab at Coriantumr’s army while they were drunk as skunks.
He strolled on over to the land of Moron and took a seat on Coriantumr’s throne.
Now, Coriantumr stayed with his troops out in the wilderness for two whole years, and let me tell ya, ‘twas a good time for beefin’ up his army.
Gilead, the brother of Shared, he got himself some muscle too, thanks to a whole mess of sneaky schemes.
It just so happened that his own high priest went and did him in while he was sittin’ pretty on his throne.
And wouldn’t ya know it, one of them secret folks offed him in a sneaky spot and took the crown for himself. His name was Lib, and he was a big fella, taller than any other man around.
Now, in Lib’s first year, Coriantumr waltzed back up to the land of Moron and challenged Lib to a tussle.
Well, they fought it out, and Lib got a hit in that wounded Coriantumr’s arm; still, Coriantumr's army kept pressin’ on, which made Lib skedaddle to the seashore.
Coriantumr chased after him, and Lib threw down again right there on the beach.
Lib got the upper hand, and those folks in Coriantumr's army hightailed it back into the wilderness of Akish.
Then Lib went after Coriantumr ‘til he caught him on the plains of Agosh. Coriantumr had herded all his people with him as he ran from Lib in that part of the land.
Once he hit them plains, Coriantumr clashed with Lib, and he gave him a whuppin’ till he kicked the bucket; still, Lib's brother shows up to take on Coriantumr, and that skirmish got real ugly, causin’ Coriantumr to run again from Lib’s brother’s army.
Now, Lib’s brother went by the name of Shiz. It came to pass that Shiz chased Coriantumr, toppled a bunch of towns, and took out both women and kids, burnin’ them places down.
Folks around the land grew fearful of Shiz; yessiree, a cry rang out—who in the world can stand against Shiz's army? Look at him sweepin’ the land clean!
Then the people started gatherin’ up in armies all across the land.
They split up; some skedaddled to Shiz’s side, while others ran to join Coriantumr.
The war had been so fierce and the bloodshed so long, you wouldn’t see a patch of land that wasn’t covered by the dead.
It was so fast and furious that no one was left to give them poor souls a proper burial; they just kept marchin’ from one bloodbath to the next, leavin’ folks—men, women, and kiddies—layin’ all over for the worms to feast on.
And the stench of it spread all over the land; folks couldn’t catch a break day or night 'cause of that smell.
But Shiz didn’t give up chasin’ Coriantumr; he swore he’d make Coriantumr pay for his brother’s blood that got spilled, plus the Lord had told Ether that Coriantumr wouldn’t fall by sword.
So, here we see the Lord unleashin’ His wrath on 'em, their wicked ways settin’ ‘em up for sure-fire destruction.
Then Shiz followed Coriantumr eastward to the coast, and they battled for three straight days down there.
The destruction in Shiz’s camp was so bad that folks started gettin’ scared and ran from Coriantumr’s soldiers; they rushed to the land of Corihor, clearin’ out the folks who wouldn’t join ‘em.
They set up their tents in the valley of Corihor, and Coriantumr threw his tents up in the valley of Shurr. Now, Shurr was close to hill Comnor, so Coriantumr rallied his troops on Comnor and blew a trumpet for Shiz’s army to come on out for a fight.
Well, they came runnin’, but got pushed back again; then they tried a second time and got sent packin’ again. By the third time, things got real heated.
Then Shiz landed a blow on Coriantumr, givin’ him some nasty wounds; Coriantumr, bleedin’ bad, fainted and got carried off like he was a goner.
Now, the number of folks lost—men, women, and kids—on both sides was so high that Shiz called his people off from chasin’ Coriantumr’s army; so, they all headed back to their camp.
