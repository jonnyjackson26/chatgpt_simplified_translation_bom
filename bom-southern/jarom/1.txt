Now listen here, I’m Jarom, just jottin’ down a few words 'cause my daddy Enos told me we ought to keep track of our family tree.
These plates ain’t much to write on, and I’m penning this for our Lamanite kin, so I ain’t gonna be scribblin’ a whole lot; ‘specially not my prophecies or revelations. What more could I even say that my folks ain’t already laid out? They’ve already spilled the beans on salvation, and that’s good enough for me.
Y’all better pay attention, ’cause there’s a heap that needs doin’ with these folks. Their hearts are as hard as a rock, their ears deaf as a post, their minds blinded, and their necks stiff as a board; but bless their hearts, God’s been real good to ‘em, not just tossing ‘em off the land just yet.
Now, there’s a good many of us who got some revelations, 'cause not everyone’s as hard-headed. Those who ain’t stiffnecked and got a little faith can have some chit-chat with the Holy Spirit, who shows ‘em what’s what, dependin’ on their level of faith.
Well, let me tell ya, two hundred years flew by, and ol' Nephi's folks got strong out here. They kept the law of Moses and made sure the Sabbath was sacred to the Lord. They didn’t go profanin’ or blasphemin’. The laws of the land were mighty strict, y’know.
And they were spreadin’ all over the place, just like the Lamanites, who were a whole lot more numerous than us Nephites; those folks loved themselves some murder and drank the blood of critters without a second thought.
Time and time again, they came at us Nephites lookin’ for a fight. But our kings and leaders were strong in their faith in the Lord; they showed the folks how to walk in His ways, and we held our ground against the Lamanites, sendin’ ‘em runnin’ from our lands, and we started makin’ our cities strong, or any place we could call home.
We got real thick, stretched out all over the place, and got ourselves plenty rich in gold, silver, all sorts of fancy stuff, and fine craftsmanship in wood, buildings, machinery, iron, copper, brass, and steel too—made all kinds of tools to work the land, and weapons for when trouble came knockin’—yep, sharp arrows, quivers, darts, javelins, the whole works for war.
So, bein’ all set to handle the Lamanites, they didn’t have much luck against us. The Lord’s word came to pass, just like He told our forefathers: as long as you keep my commandments, you’ll thrive in this land.
Now, the Lord's prophets gave the Nephites some stern warnings, ‘cause God said if they didn’t stick to His commandments and slipped into mischief, they’d be wiped off the land.
So, the prophets, priests, and teachers worked real hard, preachin’ with patience to keep the folks diligent; teachin’ the law of Moses and why it was laid down; coaxin’ ‘em to look forward to the Messiah and believe He was on His way, like He was already here. That’s how they taught.
By doin’ all that, they kept the folks from gettin’ wiped off the land; they pricked their hearts with the word, keepin’ ‘em stirred up to repent.
And lo and behold, two hundred thirty-eight years rolled on by—what with all the wars, fussin', and disagreements, that took up a bunch of time.
And I, Jarom, ain’t gonna write no more ’cause these plates are just tiny. But listen here, y’all can check out the other plates of Nephi; ‘cause them’s got all the records of our skirmishes carved in, just like the kings had it wrote down.
Now, I’m passin’ these plates to my boy Omni, so he can keep ‘em right, just like my daddies taught me to do.
