Well now, let me tell ya what the Prophet Joseph Smith had to say 'bout how the Book of Mormon came to be:
“On a warm night on the… twenty-first of September [1823] … I got down on my knees to pray and plead with the Almighty up above. 
“While I was in the midst of prayin’, I noticed this bright light floatin’ in my room, gettin’ brighter ‘til it shone more than a summer’s day, and then, outta nowhere, a figure appeared right at my bedside, hoverin’ in the air like he didn’t even touch the ground.
“He was wearin’ this loose gown that was whiter than anything you ever laid eyes on—brighter than fresh laundry on a sunny day. I swear, I ain't never seen anything so dang shiny and perfect. His hands were bare, along with his arms a bit above his wrists; his feet were bare too, with his legs showin’ a little above his ankles. His head and neck were all out in the open like that too. Didn’t have nothin’ else on but that robe; I could see right into his chest.
“Not only was his robe mighty white, but his whole self was just glorious and amazing, his face shinin’ like a bolt of lightning. The room was real lit up, but not as bright as right around him. At first sight, I was scared stiff; but that fear didn’t last long.
“He called me by name and told me he was a messenger sent straight from God, and that his name was Moroni; said God had a mission for me, and my name was gonna be talked about, both good and bad, all over the world.
“He said there was a book hid away, written on gold plates, tellin’ the story of the folks who used to live on this continent and where they came from. He also mentioned that it held the full Gospel of the Lord, as it was handed down to the ancient people.
“Plus, he said there were two stones in silver bows—kinda like magic rocks tied to a breastplate—what folks called the Urim and Thummim—stored with the plates; and these stones were what made ‘em ‘seer’ back in the day, and God had set ‘em aside for translatin’ the book. 
“He told me not to show those plates to anyone once I got ‘em, ‘cause the time for that weren’t ready yet; I was only supposed to show ‘em to folks I was told to. If I didn’t keep my mouth shut about it, I was gonna be in a heap of trouble. While we were talkin’ about them plates, I got a vision in my head so clear I could see right where they were buried, and I knew I’d recognize it again when I went there.
“Right after that chat, I saw the light gatherin’ ‘round him who was talkin’ to me, and it kept growin’ until the rest of the room was dark again ‘cept right around him; then, suddenly, it looked like a tunnel opened up straight to heaven, and he flew up ‘til he was gone, leavin’ the room all dark like it was before.
“I was layin’ there thinkin’ ‘bout how strange all this was, just blown away by what this heavenly guy had told me, when all of a sudden my room got lit up again, and just like that, he was back at my bedside.
“He started up again, repeatin’ every single thing he told me before, just as it was; and then he warned me about some real bad stuff comin’ to the earth, like hunger, war, and sickness; said these tough times were gonna hit in my generation. After tellin’ me all that, he flew back up like he did the first time.
“By this point, I was so worked up, sleep didn’t even cross my mind, and I was layin’ there astonished by everything I’d seen and heard. But then, surprise of all surprises—there he was again, standin' by my bed, tellin’ me all the same stuff over again, and added a heads-up, warnin’ me that ol’ Satan would try to lead me astray (since my family was doin' it tough), trying to get me to snag them plates for riches. He said no way! I needed to go after them plates just to glorify God, and I couldn’t be motivated by anythin’ but buildin’ His kingdom; otherwise, I wasn’t gonna be gettin' ‘em.
“After that third time, he took off to heaven again, leavin’ me to think on all the oddness I just went through; and almost before I could gather my thoughts after he left, the rooster crowed, and I realized dawn was breakin’, meaning we’d been yappin’ away all night long.
“I got up from my bed after that and headed off to do the usual chores for the day; but when I tried to muscle through like I always did, I realized I was just too weak to do anything. My dad, who was workin' alongside me, figured somethin’ was off and told me to head on home. I set out thinkin’ I’d just stroll back to the house, but when I tried to climb over the fence from the field, my strength gave out completely, and I crumpled to the ground, not havin’ a clue what was goin’ on for a spell.
“The first thing I remember was a voice callin’ my name. I looked up and sure enough, there was that same messenger hoverin’ over me, all lit up just like before. He then told me the same things all over again, and ordered me to go tell my dad about the vision and the commandments I received.
“I did just that; I went back to my dad in the field and laid it all out for him. He told me it was from God and urged me to do exactly as the messenger said. I left that field and went right to the spot where the messenger pointed out the plates were hidden, and ‘cause I’d seen it so clearly in the vision, as soon as I got there, I knew exactly where it was.
“Close by the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, there’s a big ol’ hill, the tallest one 'round these parts. Near the west side of that hill, not too far from the top, under a hefty rock, were them plates, tucked away in a stone box. This rock was thick, rounded in the middle, and tapered down toward the edges, so the middle peeped outta the dirt, but the edges were all buried.
“Once I cleared the dirt away, I found me a lever, stuffed it under the edge of that rock, and with a little elbow grease, I lifted it up. I looked inside, and lo and behold, there were the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, just like that messenger said. The box was put together with stones in some sorta cement. On the bottom of the box, there were two stones laid crosswise, and on ‘em were the plates and the other stuff.
“I tried pullin’ ‘em out, but the messenger stopped me, and let me know the time to bring ‘em out wasn’t right yet; it wouldn’t be ‘til four years later; but he told me I needed to come back to that spot in exactly a year from then, and he’d be there to meet me, tellin’ me to keep comin' back until it was time to fetch the plates.
“Just like he said, I went back each year, and every time I found the same messenger waitin’ for me, givin’ me his wisdom and guidance about what the Lord was fixin’ to do, and how things were gonna go down in the last days. 
“Well, finally, the moment came for me to get them plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second of September, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, I showed up again just like usual, and that same messenger handed them over to me with this serious warning: I was responsible for keepin’ ‘em safe; if I didn’t, or if I neglected them, I’d be cut off; but if I worked hard to protect ‘em until he came for ‘em, they’d stay safe.
“I was soon wise to why I had such a heavy load to keep them safe, and why that messenger had said once I did what was asked, he’d come for ‘em. ‘Cause no sooner did folks find out I had 'em, than everyone tried their hardest to pry ‘em away from me. Any trick they could think of, they tried it. The pressure really ramped up, and lots of folks were always lookin’ to grab ‘em if they could. But by the grace of God, they stayed safe with me ‘til I accomplished what I was supposed to do by ‘em. So when the messenger came back for ‘em, I handed ‘em right over, and he’s been holdin’ onto ‘em since then, on the second day of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-eight.”

That old record brought out from the dirt was like a voice from a people long gone, and it got turned into the words we speak today by the good ol’ power of God, all stamped with His divine nod, first hittin’ the shelves as The Book of Mormon.
