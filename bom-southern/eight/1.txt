Well, let it be known to all folks, tribes, languages, and people, wherever this here work lands: That Joseph Smith, Junior, the fella who put this work together, has shown us them plates folks been talkin’ about, lookin’ all shiny like gold; and we got to handle as many of them pages as Smith has translated, right there with our own hands; and we also laid our eyes on the carvings on 'em, all of which looked real ancient and somethin’ mighty special. And we’re here to share our testimony real serious-like, sayin’ that Smith showed us what we’re talkin’ about, ‘cause we’ve seen it, held it, and we know without a doubt that Smith's got them plates we mentioned. And we’re puttin’ our names out for all the world to see, to testify to everyone what we done seen. And we ain't tellin’ no tall tales, with God as our witness.
