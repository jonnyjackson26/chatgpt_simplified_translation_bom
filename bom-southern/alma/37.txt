Well now, lemme tell ya, the brass plates and them other scriptures are kept safe-like to help folks get to that good ol’ salvation—Them Jaredites got wiped out 'cause they was real wicked—Their sneaky oaths and promises need to stay hidden from the folks—You best be talkin' with the Lord 'bout all you doin's—Just like the Liahona led the Nephites, the word of Christ guides folks to everlasting life. 'Bout 74 B.C.
And now, my boy Helaman, I'm tellin’ ya to take them records that's been handed to me;
And I’m also askin’ you to keep a record of this here people, just like I done with the plates of Nephi, and keep all this stuff sacred as I have, 'cause there’s a reason why it’s all preserved.
And these brass plates, they got some mighty important engravings on 'em, with holy scriptures and our ancestors' family lines, straight from the start—
Well now, it’s been prophesied by our kin that they’d be kept and passed down from one generation to the next, kept safe by the Lord until they reach all nations, kinds, tongues, and peoples, so they can know the mysteries on ‘em.
And now listen, if they’re kept right, they gotta shine bright; yep, they’ll keep their brightness, and all them plates that hold the holy word will too.
Now, you might think I’m bein’ foolish here; but I tell ya, small and simple things can lead to big ol’ miracles; sometimes small means can stump the wise folks.
And the Lord God works through these small means to bring 'bout His big and eternal plans; little things can sure confuse those wise ones and save lots of souls.
And right now, it’s been wise in God’s eyes to keep these things safe; they’ve got folks thinkin’ better, makin' ‘em realize their missteps and bringin' ‘em to find out about their God for their soul's salvation.
Sure as shootin’, I tell ya, if it weren't for them records on these plates, Ammon and his buddies wouldn’t have been able to turn so many Lamanites around on the wrong traditions of their folks; yep, them records and their words led ‘em to repent; brought 'em to know the Lord their God, and to find joy in Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
And who knows, they might just be the reason many thousands, and even our stubborn Nephite brothers who are hardenin' their hearts with all that sin, come to know their Redeemer?
Now I don’t fully grasp these mysteries yet, so I reckon I’ll hold my horses.
But it’ll do to say they're preserved for a smart reason, known only to God; He’s wise over all His doin's, His ways are right, and His course keeps goin’ ‘round and ‘round.
Oh, remember, remember, my boy Helaman, how strict God’s commandments are. And He said: If ya keep my commandments, you’ll prosper in the land—but if ya don’t, y’all gonna be cut off from His presence.
And remember now, my son, God has trusted you with these sacred things He’s kept safe for a wise purpose, so that He can show His power to the folks who come after us.
And listen here, I’m tellin’ ya by the spirit of prophecy, if ya go messin' with God’s commandments, then those sacred things gonna be taken away from ya by God’s power, and you’ll be turned over to Satan to get tossed ‘round like chaff in the wind.
But if you keep God’s commandments and deal with those sacred things like the Lord wants ya to, (gotta ask the Lord for help in all things you do with ‘em) then no power from this earth or hell can take ‘em away from you, ‘cause God is strong enough to keep His word.
He’ll fulfill all the promises He made to you, ‘cause He done fulfilled promises to our fathers before us.
He promised them He’d preserve these things with a wise purpose, to show His might to the future generations.
And now look, He’s done fulfilled one purpose already, bringin' a whole bunch of Lamanites back to knowin’ the truth; He’s shown His might with 'em, and He’ll keep showin’ His power to them down the line; that’s why they’ll be kept.
So I command you, my boy Helaman, to be diligent in followin’ all my words, and to keep God’s commandments as they’re laid out.
Now, I got some words for ya ‘bout them twenty-four plates; keep ‘em safe, so the secrets and dark works of them folks that got wiped out can be revealed to this here people; yep, all their murders and robbings, and all their wickedness and horrid actions, need to be known; and make sure you hold on to them interpreters.
‘Cause the Lord saw His people was messin’ ’round in darkness, doin' secret murders and awful things; so He said if they didn’t shape up, they’d be wiped off the face of the earth.
And the Lord said: I’ll get my servant Gazelem a stone that shines in the dark to show my folks who serve me the works of their brothers—yep, their secret doin's, their dark works, and all their wicked deeds.
And now, my boy, these interpreters were fixed up so the word of God could come to pass, just like He said:
I’ll bring out all their secret doin’s and horrid acts from the dark to the light; and if they don’t repent, I’ll wipe 'em off the face of the earth; and I’ll reveal all their secrets to every nation that ends up livin’ on this land.
And now, my boy, we see they didn’t repent; so they got themselves destroyed, and the word of God’s been fulfilled; yep, their secret sins got dragged outta the dark and laid bare for us.
And now, my boy, I command you to hold tight to all their oaths, their promises, and those shady agreements in their secret bad doin's; yep, keep all their signs and wonders from this people, so they don’t know ‘em, or they might end up in the dark too and get wiped out.
‘Cause there’s a curse on all this land, destruction’s comin’ for all those dark-doers, according to God’s power, when they’re all ripe for it; so I sure hope this people don’t get wiped out.
So, keep them secret ploys of their oaths and promises from this people, and only let 'em know about their wickedness and murders; teach 'em to hate that wrong-doing and awful things, and remind 'em these folks got destroyed on account of their sins and wickedness.
‘Cause, believe it or not, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came around tellin’ 'em ‘bout their wrongs; and the blood of them they killed cried out to the Lord their God for revenge on their murderers; and that’s how God’s judgments fell on those dark-doers and secret groups.
Yep, cursed be this land forever to those dark-doers and secret schemers, ‘cept they repent before it’s too late.
And now, my boy, remember what I told ya; don’t trust those secret plans with this people, but teach ‘em a lasting hatred for sin and wrong-doing.
Preach repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach ‘em to stay humble and meek in their hearts; teach ‘em to resist every temptation from the devil, leanin' on their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Teach ‘em to never tire of doin’ good, but to be humble and lowly in heart; for them will find rest for their souls.
Oh, remember, my boy, and get yourself wise while you're young; learn in your youth to follow God’s commandments.
And sure enough, cry out to God for all your needs; let all you do be for the Lord, wherever you go, let it be in the Lord; and keep your thoughts on the Lord, and let your heart's affections be on the Lord for good.
Talk to the Lord in all you do, and He’ll guide ya good; when you hit the hay at night, just lay down to the Lord, so He can keep watch over ya while you sleep; and when you get up in the mornin’, make sure your heart's full of thanks to God; and if you do all that, you’ll be lifted up come the last day.
And now, my boy, I got somethin’ to say ‘bout that thing our fathers called a ball, or a director—or they called it Liahona, which means compass; and the Lord put it together.
And look, no man can do the likes of that fancy work. It was made to show our fathers the way they should go in the wild.
And it worked for ‘em according to their faith in God; so if they believed God could make them spindles point the way, well, it happened just like that; they got that miracle, and a whole bunch more miracles by the hand of God, day after day.
Even still, ‘cause them miracles came from small means, they saw mighty works. They got lazy and forgot to exercise their faith and hustle, and then them mighty works stopped, and they didn’t move along in their journey;
So, they stayed in the wilderness, not goin’ the right way, and they suffered from hunger and thirst ‘cause of their mess ups.
And now, my boy, I want you to understand these things ain’t without a shadow; ‘cause just like our fathers got lazy with this compass (now them things was temporal), they didn’t prosper; and it’s the same with spiritual things.
For it’s as easy to heed the word of Christ, which’ll show ya the straight path to eternal happiness, as it was for our fathers to listen to this compass, which pointed to the promised land.
And now I ask, ain’t there a type of this thing? For just as sure as this director guided our fathers to the promised land by followin’ its path, the words of Christ will carry us across this vale of pain into a much better promised land.
Oh my son, let’s not be lazy just ‘cause the way is easy; ‘cause it was the same with our fathers; it was laid out for them, that if they looked, they might live; and it’s set up for us too. The way is ready, and if we look, we can live forever.
And now, my son, make sure you take good care of these holy things, look to God and live. Go to this people and share the word, and be serious. My son, I bid you farewell.
