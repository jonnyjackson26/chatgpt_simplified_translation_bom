Well, lemme tell ya, it was right at the start of that thirty-sixth year of them judges runnin’ things over the Nephi folks, when good ol’ Shiblon got his hands on them sacred records that Helaman got from Alma.
He was a straight-shootin' fella, walkin’ the line with God, doin’ good deeds all the time, keepin’ the Lord’s commandments—just like his brother did too.
Then ain’t it just the way that Moroni passed on outta this world too. And that’s how the thirty-sixth year of them judges wrapped up.
Now, rollin' into the thirty-seventh year of the judges, we had a whole bunch of folks, ‘bout five thousand four hundred men, along with their wives and kiddos, packin’ up and leavin’ Zarahemla to head north.
So this feller Hagoth, real curious kinda guy he was, went and built hisself a mighty big ol’ ship right near the land of Bountiful, on them Desolation borders, and sent that thing sailin' out into the west sea by that narrow neck headin’ northward.
And let me tell ya, a whole heap of Nephites climbed aboard that ship, packin’ it full of supplies, women, and kids, settin’ their sights north. And that’s how the thirty-seventh year came to a close.
Then in the thirty-eighth year, this fella didn’t stop; he built more ships. That first one even came back, and lots more folks hopped on, loadin’ up with supplies, and off they went again all headed north.
Now, we ain't never heard from ‘em again, reckon they got swallowed up by the deep blue. Another ship sailed out too, but where it went, shoot, we ain’t got a clue.
Then gotta say, that year had plenty of folks packin’ up, headin’ off to the north too. And that’s how the thirty-eighth year wrapped up.
Come thirty-ninth year of them judges, Shiblon passed away as well, while Corianton took off to the north on a ship, tryin’ to haul some supplies to them folks that had already gone.
So it was mighty important for Shiblon to pass those sacred records down to Helaman, the son of Helaman, named after his daddy, ‘fore he kicked the bucket.
Now here’s the thing, all them engravings Helaman had were sent out among the people, except the parts Alma said to keep under wraps.
But hey, these precious things were meant to be kept sacred and passed down through the ages; so in this year, Helaman got ‘em right before Shiblon's time ran out.
And wouldn't you know it, this year also saw some dissenters who skedaddled off to the Lamanites, sparkin’ up their anger against the Nephites again.
Then, in that same year, they brought down a big ol’ army to throw down with Moronihah’s folks, but they got their tails whooped and had to skedaddle back home, takin’ some heavy losses along the way.
And that's how the thirty-ninth year of them judges over the Nephi folks came to an end.
So that wraps up the tale of Alma, his boy Helaman, and also Shiblon, who was his son too.
