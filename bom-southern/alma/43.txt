Well, let me tell ya, the boys of Alma went out amongst the folks to spread the good word. And Alma, bless his heart, couldn’t sit still neither, so he hopped on out there too.
Now, I ain’t gonna spend too much time talkin’ ‘bout their preachin’, ‘cept to say they was preachin’ the truth, guided by the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they was doin’ it in that holy order God called ‘em to.
Now I’m fixin' to get back to tellin’ ya ‘bout the tussles between the Nephites and Lamanites, right in the eighteenth year of the judges’ rule.
See, the Zoramites done turned into Lamanites; so when the eighteenth year kicked off, the Nephites caught wind that the Lamanites was comin’ for ‘em, so they got their act together for war; shoot, they rounded up their armies in Jershon.
Well, those Lamanites showed up with their thousands, rollin' right into Antionum, the land of the Zoramites, led by a fella named Zerahemnah.
Now, lemme tell ya, them Amalekites were even meaner and more bloodthirsty than them Lamanites, so Zerahemnah put them Amalekites and Zoramites in charge of the Lamanite troops.
He did that to keep up the hate towards the Nephites, hopin’ to use ‘em to carry out his nasty plans.
’Cause, you see, his plan was to rile up the Lamanites to get mad at the Nephites so he could try to grab up all the power for himself, bringin' ‘em into bondage.
Now, the Nephites’ plan was to protect their homes, their land, their wives, and their kids, keepin' ‘em safe from any harm; they also wanted to hold onto their rights and freedoms, so they could worship God how they saw fit.
They knew that if they got caught by the Lamanites, anyone who dared to worship the real God would be toast.
And they was also aware of how much the Lamanites despised their folks, the Anti-Nephi-Lehi group, who was known as the people of Ammon—those folks wouldn’t lift a finger to fight, seein’ as they had made a promise and staunchly stuck to it—so if they fell to the Lamanites, they’d be done for.
And the Nephites weren’t gonna let that happen; they made sure to gift ‘em some of their land to call home.
Them folks of Ammon even pitched in a good hefty sum to help support the Nephite armies; so with that, the Nephites were left all on their lonesome to face the Lamanites, who was a mixed bunch of Lamanites, Lemuelites, and folks led by Ishmael, plus all those who split from the Nephites, like the Amalekites, Zoramites, and the priests’ descendants from good ol’ Noah.
Now, those descendants were almost as many as the Nephites; so ya see, the Nephites had to battle their brothers, right down to spillin’ blood.
Well, it so happened that when the Lamanite armies gathered up in Antionum, the Nephites were poised and ready to meet ‘em in Jershon.
Now the head honcho of the Nephites, who’d been picked to be chief captain—he was in charge of all the Nephite armies—and his name was Moroni;
And Moroni took full control, runnin’ the show hard. He was just a spry twenty-five years old when he got the boss title over those Nephite armies.
Then he crossed paths with the Lamanites right there at Jershon, and his folks were armed to the teeth with swords, cimeters, and all sorts of weapons.
Well, when the Lamanites laid eyes on the Nephites, or Moroni’s crew, with their breastplates, arm shields, and those fancy head shields, along with thick clothes to boot—
Those Lamanites weren’t in no shape like that; all they had was swords and cimeters, bows and arrows, stones and slings; they was bare, just a small piece of skin wrapped ‘round their waists; shoot, most of ‘em were naked, skip those Zoramites and Amalekites;
But they didn’t even have no breastplates or shields—so you bet they were quakin’ in their boots at the sight of the Nephites’ armor, even if they outnumbered ‘em.
Would ya believe it? They didn’t even have the guts to face the Nephites at Jershon; they hightailed it out of Antionum, wanderin’ through the wilderness, skirtin’ around the river Sidon, tryin’ to sneak into Manti to take over the land; they figured Moroni and his boys wouldn’t catch on to their little scheme.
But as soon as they high-tailed it into the wild, Moroni sent out some spies to keep an eye on ‘em; and knowing what Alma had prophesized, he sent some men to ask him to check in with the Lord about where the Nephite armies oughta go to defend against those Lamanites.
Well, the Lord spoke to Alma, and Alma relayed the message back to Moroni that those Lamanites were prowlin’ ‘round in the wild, tryin’ to sneak over to Manti to pounce on the weaker folks. And those messengers delivered that message crystal clear to Moroni.
Now Moroni, leavin’ some of his army in Jershon, hopin’ no Lamanite stragglers would make it in to steal the city, he took the rest of his crew and marched over to Manti.
He rallied all the folks in that part of the land to unite and fight against them Lamanites, defending their homes and their country, their rights, and their freedoms; so they was ready when the Lamanites showed up.
Then Moroni had his army get all sneaky like, tucked away in a valley close to the bank of the Sidon, which was on the west side of the river in the wild.
He set up spies all ’round, keepin’ tabs on when them Lamanite camps would show up.
And bless his heart, Moroni knew them Lamanites had a wicked plan to wipe out their brothers, or to subjugate ‘em, so they could build their own kingdom all over the land;
And he also knew the Nephites’ only wish was to keep their land, freedom, and church safe, so he figured it weren’t no sin to defend ‘em smart; so he found out through his spies which way the Lamanites was headin’.
So he split his forces and moved part of ‘em into the valley, hidin’ some on the east and south sides of hill Riplah;
And the rest he kept hidden in the west valley, on the river Sidon’s west side, stretchin’ down to the borders of Manti.
With that, he set up his army just how he wanted, prepped for a lil’ showdown.
Next thing you know, the Lamanites were comin’ up from the north side of that hill where some of Moroni’s army was tucked away.
As the Lamanites passed Riplah and moved into the valley, headin’ to cross the Sidon, the bunch hidin’ on the south led by a fella named Lehi popped out, surroundin’ ‘em from behind.
Well, when them Lamanites noticed the Nephites creepin’ up behind ‘em, they spun around and started throwin’ down with Lehi’s crew.
And boy, oh boy, the grim work started on both sides, but it was worse for the Lamanites, since they was bare and catchin’ those nasty blows from them Nephite swords and cimeters, which brought them to their knees right quick.
On the flip side, the Nephites had a few takedowns here and there, but they had some protection, what with their breastplates and shields keepin’ them from too much harm; so, they usin’ their own weapons, they went to town on them Lamanites.
Then the Lamanites started to freak out, seein’ how bad things were goin’ for ‘em, and they began to skedaddle towards the river Sidon.
Lehi and his boys chased after ‘em, herding ‘em right into the waters of Sidon, but Lehi kept his folks on the banks to keep ‘em from crossin’.
Soon enough, Moroni and his crew caught up with the Lamanites in the valley, just on the other side of the Sidon, and started layin’ the smackdown.
Them Lamanites pulled another fast one, tryin' to get away towards Manti but found themselves face-to-face with Moroni’s boys again.
In this round, them Lamanites fought harder than ever; I’m tellin’ ya, never before had they put up such a fierce fight, no sir, not from the very start.
They was spurred on by them Zoramites and Amalekites, who was their top captains and leaders, and that Zerahemnah, who was leadin’ ‘em; they fought like wild beasts, and many a Nephite felt their sting, since they smashed right through a whole mess of their headplates, pierced many a breastplate, and chopped off a heap of arms; those Lamanites was madder than a hornet.
Still, the Nephites were spurred on by a good cause, ‘cause they weren’t fightin’ for a throne or power but for their homesteads, freedoms, wives, kids, and everything they held dear, yes sir, for their right to worship and their church.
They was just doin’ what they thought was their duty to God; since the Lord had told ‘em and their forefathers that: As long as they weren’t guilty of messin’ up first, they shouldn’t let themselves get squashed by their enemies.
And besides, the Lord said: Ya gotta defend yer families even if it means spillin’ blood. So, that’s why the Nephites were throwin’ down with the Lamanites, tryin’ to save their kin, their lands, their country, rights, and religion.
And when Moroni’s men caught sight of how fierce them Lamanites were, they were fixin’ to run, but Moroni, seein’ that, riled ‘em up with these thoughts—thinkin’ ‘bout their home, their freedom, and gettin’ out from under that yoke.
Then they turned back on them Lamanites, cryin’ out to the Lord for their liberty and their freedom from that bondage.
They started standin’ tall against the Lamanites, and in that very moment they hollered out to the Lord for their freedom, those Lamanites started to bounce out, runnin’ straight for the Sidon.
Now, them Lamanites had ‘em outnumbered by more than double; still, they got driven back ‘til they was all huddled up in one spot, the valley by the river Sidon.
So, Moroni’s forces surrounded ‘em good, comin’ at ‘em from both sides of the river, while Lehi’s men was set up on the east side.
So, when Zerahemnah laid eyes on Lehi’s gang over on the river's east and Moroni’s army on the other side, he was struck with a mighty fear.
And once Moroni caught wind of their fright, he ordered his crew to ease up on the bloodshed.
