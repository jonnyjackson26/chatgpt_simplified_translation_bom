Well, let me tell ya, some folks just ain't listenin' to the words of Helaman and his buddies, so they all kind of gathered up to go against their own kin.
And I reckon they got plenty mad, so mad they aimed to take 'em out.
Now, the big fella leading the angry crowd was a strong one, goin’ by the name of Amalickiah.
And Amalickiah wanted that throne real bad; and those folks who was fumin’ wanted him to be their king too—turns out most of 'em were the lower judges lookin' for a bit of power.
They fell for all those sweet-talkin’ lies from Amalickiah, thinkin’ that if they backed him up and made him king, he'd let 'em rule over everybody.
So, even though Helaman and his crew were preachin' with great care for the church, those folks got led astray by Amalickiah into all sorts of arguments.
And plenty in the church fell for his smooth talk, and they ended up pullin’ away from the church; things were lookin’ real shaky for the folks in Nephi, despite the big ol’ win they had over the Lamanites and all the joy from bein’ saved by the Lord.
Y'all can see how quick folks forget their God, huh? They sure do fall into trouble quick when the devil’s whisperin’ in their ears.
And boy, do we see just how much trouble one bad apple can stir up among people.
Sure as shootin’, Amalickiah, with his sly ways and smooth words, swayed a whole lotta folks to do wrong; he was lookin’ to tear apart God’s church and ruin the freedom God blessed ‘em with on that good ol’ land.
Now, Moroni, who was the big boss of the Nephite armies, he got wind of all this fuss, and man, he was madder than a hornet at Amalickiah.
So, he ripped his coat, wrote on a piece—In memory of our God, our religion, our freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and stuck it on a pole.
He put on his headgear, buckled on his armor, and took that pole with his torn coat (called it the title of liberty), then he knelt down and prayed real hard to God for liberty to bless his people as long as there were any good Christians left on that land.
Now, that's how all the real believers in Christ, ya see, who were part of God’s church, were referred to by them that weren’t part of it.
And those who were in the church? They stayed true; all the folks who really believed in Christ wore that name proudly, calling themselves Christians ‘cause they believed in the Lord who was to come.
So, Moroni prayed that the Christians and freedom of the land would have the Lord’s favor.
When he had bared his heart to God, he shouted out the whole stretch of land south of Desolation, callin' it a chosen land and the land of liberty.
And he declared: “God ain’t goin’ to let us, who are mocked for takin' on the name of Christ, be stomped down and wiped off, unless we really do it to ourselves.”
Once he spoke those words, he went out among the folks, waving his torn garment so everyone could see what he had written, yellin' loud:
“Listen up, anyone willin’ to stand up for this title on our land, come on out with the strength of the Lord and make a promise to protect our rights and our faith so God can bless ya.”
After Moroni yelled this, folks came runnin', all armored up, rippin’ their clothes to show their commitment, sayin' they wouldn’t abandon the Lord their God. They knew if they messed up and felt ashamed to wear the name of Christ, the Lord would tear ‘em apart just like they tore their clothes.
That right there was their promise, and they tossed their garments at Moroni’s feet, sayin': “We promise with our God if we fall into sin, we gon’ be treated just like our northern kin; He can toss us at the feet of our enemies just like we threw our clothes at you.”
Moroni told ‘em: “Lookie here, we’re a part of Jacob's seed; we’re a piece of Joseph’s kin who got his coat tore by his own brothers; so let's remember to stick to God’s commandments, or our clothes might end up torn too, and we could end up in prison or worse, just like what happens when we stray.”
Yeah, let’s hold on to our freedom as Joseph’s folks; we gotta remember what Jacob said before he passed away, ‘cause he foresaw that some of Joseph’s coat would be saved and wouldn’t rot away. He declared—just like my son’s coat got saved, so shall a piece of my boy’s seed be taken care of by God, while the rest of Joseph's kin might fade away, just like that coat.
Now, that brings a tear to my eye; still, my heart swells with joy for my son, ‘cause part of his kin is comin’ back to God.
Now, this was what Jacob had to say.
And who knows if those who fall away from us, just like that coat of Joseph, ain't that very remnant? And if we don’t stand strong in our faith, it could just as well be us.
Now, it came to pass that after Moroni said all that, he went out, sending word all over the place where there was fuss, gathering folks who wanted to protect their freedom, to stand up against Amalickiah and them traitors known as Amalickiahites.
Once Amalickiah saw Moroni’s folks outnumbered his crew—and noticed that his own folks were iffy about the ruckus they got into—he was worried he might lose the fight, so he took off with whoever was willing and headed for the land of Nephi.
Moroni figured it wouldn’t do for the Lamanites to get any stronger; he planned to cut off Amalickiah’s folks or bring ‘em back and put an end to Amalickiah; he knew that rascal would rile the Lamanites up to come at ‘em, and that’s exactly what Amalickiah was up to for his own gain.
So, Moroni thought it wise to gather his troops who were ready for war and all armed up, they agreed to keep things peaceful—and he took ‘em off into the wilderness to cut off Amalickiah’s path.
And sure enough, he did what he set out to do, marched right into the wild and met the armies of Amalickiah head-on.
Well, it didn’t end well for Amalickiah; he bolted with just a handful of his men, while the rest fell right into Moroni’s hands and were dragged back to Zarahemla.
Moroni, bein’ a man backed by the top judges and the voice of the people, had the power to lead the Nephite armies and keep ‘em in line.
Turns out he made sure anyone among the Amalickiahites who didn’t want to pledge to support freedom got put to death; there weren’t too many who turned down that promise of freedom.
And he raised the title of liberty high up on every tower across the Nephite lands; that’s how Moroni set the standard of liberty for the Nephites.
Folks started to see peace again in the land; they kept it up 'til nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the judges’ reign.
Helaman and the high priests kept the church in order too; for four whole years, they saw a lot of peace and joy in the church.
Now, there were many who passed on, firmly believein’ their souls were saved by Jesus Christ; they left this world with smiles on their faces.
Some shuffled off this mortal coil from fevers, which happened plenty during certain times of the year—but it wasn’t too bad, ‘cause there were lots of good plants and roots God set up to cure what ails ya, keepin' folks from gettin’ sick all due to the climate.
But some folks did pass on from good ol’ age; and those who died in Christ’s faith sure are happy with Him, as I reckon we all can suppose.
