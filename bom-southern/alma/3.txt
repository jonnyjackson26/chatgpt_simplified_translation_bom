The Amlicites done marked themselves just like the prophets said—The Lamanites were cursed for bein’ all rebellious—Folks sure do bring their own troubles down on themselves—The Nephites took down another Lamanite crew. Round ‘bout 87–86 B.C.
So it happened that the Nephites who weren’t cut down by the battle didn’t count the ones they buried—now the folks who got killed were too many to count, y’all—once they wrapped up buryin’ their dead, they headed back to their lands, their homes, their wives, and their young'uns.
A whole lotta women and kids got whacked with the sword, and a bunch of their flocks and herds went down, too; plus plenty of their fields of grain got trampled down by all them folks.
Now many of the Lamanites and Amlicites who bit the dust by the river Sidon were tossed right into the water; and lemme tell ya, their bones are deep down in the sea, and there sure are a whole lot of ‘em.
The Amlicites looked different from the Nephites, ‘cause they marked their foreheads with red like them Lamanites; but they didn’t shave their heads like the Lamanites did.
Now the Lamanites had shaved heads; they weren’t wearin’ much except for some skin wrapped ‘round their waists, along with their armor, bows, arrows, stones, and slings, and all that.
And the Lamanites had dark skin, just like the mark their daddies got on account of their wrongdoing and rebellion against their brothers: Nephi, Jacob, Joseph, and Sam, who were good and righteous men.
And their kinfolk tried to wipe ‘em out, so they ended up cursed; and the Lord God slapped a mark on ‘em, yes sir, on Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, plus Ishmaelitish women, too.
And this here was done so their kids wouldn’t mix with their brethren, so the Lord God could keep His people safe, keepin’ ‘em from mixin’ and believe in some downright wrong traditions that’d lead to their fall.
And it happened that whoever mixed their seed with the Lamanites ended up bringin’ the same curse on their own young'uns.
So, whosoever let themselves be led away by the Lamanites was tagged under that lot, and a mark was put on ‘em.
And it came to pass that whoever didn’t buy into the Lamanites’ traditions, but rather believed the records that came outta Jerusalem and the correct traditions from their folks, who believed in God’s commandments and kept ‘em, were dubbed the Nephites, or the folks of Nephi, from then on—
And it’s them who held onto the true records of their kinfolk, and also of the Lamanites’ folks.
Now let’s talk ‘bout the Amlicites again; they also done put a mark on themselves, sure enough, a right red mark on their foreheads.
So the Word of God got fulfilled, ‘cause them were the words He told Nephi: Look here, the Lamanites I’ve cursed, and I’ll put a mark on ‘em so they and their kids can be kept apart from you and your young'uns, from now on and forever, ‘less they turn from their wicked ways and come back to me so I can have mercy on ‘em.
And again: I’ll put a mark on whoever mixes their seed with your brethren, so they’ll be cursed too.
And again: I’ll mark the fella who fights against you and your kin.
And once more, I say, whoever walks away from you won’t be called your seed no more; and I’ll bless you, and whoever’s called your seed from now on and forever; and these were the promises from the Lord to Nephi and his kin.
Now the Amlicites didn’t know they were fulfillin’ God’s words when they started markin’ their foreheads; still, they came out in plain rebellion against God; so it made sense for ‘em to catch the curse.
Now I want y’all to see that they brought this curse on themselves; and just like that, every man who’s cursed brings his own condemnation on himself.
Well, it came to pass right after the battle in Zarahemla with the Lamanites and Amlicites, another army of Lamanites showed up to take on the Nephites, right in the same spot where the first army met the Amlicites.
And then there was an army sent out to kick ‘em outta their land.
Now Alma, bein' hurt, didn’t go up to fight against the Lamanites this time;
But he sent a whole heap of folks against ‘em; they went up, took out a bunch of Lamanites, and sent the rest runnin’ off from their land.
Then they came back and started settlin’ things down in the land, not troubled no more for a spell by their enemies.
Now all these things happened, yep, all these fights and fussin’ got started and wrapped up in the fifth year of them judges’ reign.
And in just one year, thousands and tens of thousands of souls left this plain for the eternal world, so they could collect their rewards based on how they acted, whether good or bad, aim for eternal happiness or eternal misery, dependin’ on what spirit they chose to follow, whether it was a good spirit or a bad one.
Cause every man gets paid by the one he chooses to follow, and that’s according to prophecy; so let it go by the truth. And that’s how the fifth year of them judges came to a close.
