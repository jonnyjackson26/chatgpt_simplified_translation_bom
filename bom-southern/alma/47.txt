Well, lemme tell ya, Amalickiah, that fella was up to some real shady stuff, using deceit, murder, and all sorts of tricky business to snag the crown from them Lamanites—those Nephite turncoats, lemme tell ya, they were wilder and meaner than the Lamanites themselves, way back ‘round 72 B.C.
Now, we’re gonna spin back to Amalickiah and the folks who skedaddled off with him into the wild; see, he took his crew up into the land of Nephi among them Lamanites, and you best believe he stirred ‘em up fierce and got ‘em mad at the Nephites. The Lamanite king was all riled up and sent out a call to arms to all his peeps to come together and get ready to fight the Nephites.
So, when that proclamation spread ‘round, you can bet they were scairt to death; yes sir, they didn’t wanna make the king mad, and they didn’t wanna take on the Nephites neither because they were worried ‘bout losin' their lives. A whole heap of ‘em just plain refused to follow the king’s orders.
Now, that king got real riled up by their defiance; so, he gave Amalickiah the reins of the part of his army that was still listenin’ to him, tellin’ him to go out and whip ‘em into shape for battle.
Well, you see, this was just what Amalickiah wanted, ‘cause he was slicker than a greased pig when it come to bein’ evil, layin' out schemes to unseat the king of the Lamanites right in his noggin.
Now Amalickiah had taken command of those Lamanites who still backed the king; and he was workin’ to win over those who weren’t playin' along, so he headed on over to a spot called Onidah, ‘cause all the Lamanites had skedaddled there, thinkin’ that the army was about to wipe ‘em out.
And they even picked a fella to be king and lead ‘em; they were all fired up, resolute that they wasn't gonna budge when it came to fightin’ them Nephites.
Well, they all huddled together on top of this here mountain called Antipas, gettin’ ready for a showdown.
Now, Amalickiah wasn’t fixin’ to engage ‘em like the king commanded; nah, his plan was to cozy up to the Lamanite armies so he could slide right in as their leader, kick the king to the curb, and take over the kingdom for himself.
So, he set his army to pitchin’ tents down in the valley near mount Antipas.
As night rolled in, he sent a sneaky message up to the mountain, askin’ that the leader of them up there, a fella named Lehonti, come down so they could talk things over.
Well, when Lehonti got the word, he wasn’t havin’ none of it and wouldn’t go down. Amalickiah sent another request, and when Lehonti still wouldn’t budge, well, he sent a third ask.
So, when Amalickiah couldn’t get Lehonti to come down, he decided to go up the mountain himself, dang near to Lehonti’s camp; he sent his fourth message, beggin’ him to drop down and bring his guards along too.
Eventually, Lehonti came down with his guards to meet Amalickiah, who then pitched a plan to come back down with his whole army at night and surround the king’s men while Amalickiah would hand ‘em over to Lehonti, if he’d make him a second-in-command.
Lehonti took his men down and surrounded Amalickiah’s lot, and before them fellas even woke up at first light, they found themselves boxed in by Lehonti's army.
Once they saw they were trapped, they pleaded with Amalickiah to let ‘em join their buddies; didn’t wanna end up all wiped out. Now, that was exactly what Amalickiah had been hopin’ for.
So, he turned over his men, goin’ against the king's orders. That was just the ticket for Amalickiah to move ahead with his plan to send the king packin’.
Now, the custom ‘mongst the Lamanites was if their main leader got himself killed, they’d just put the second-in-command in charge.
Next thing you know, Amalickiah had one of his servants slip some poison to Lehonti, slow and steady, until the poor guy kicked the bucket.
Once Lehonti was dead, them Lamanites wasted no time in crowning Amalickiah as their leader and chief honcho.
Amalickiah rolled into the land of Nephi, strutting into the city with his troops (figured he’d hit the jackpot) and took over the town.
Then the king came out to greet him with his guards, thinkin’ Amalickiah had done his duty and gathered up a big ol’ army to take on them Nephites.
But listen here, as the king approached, Amalickiah set his servants up to meet the king and they all bowed down like they was payin’ their respects.
So the king reached out his hand to raise ‘em up, just like Lamanites do, showin' peace, which is somethin’ they picked up from the Nephites.
When he raised the first fella off the ground, wham, Amalickiah stabbed the king right in the heart, and down he went.
Now, the king’s servants took off runnin’, and Amalickiah’s crew raised a ruckus, hollerin’:
“Hey now, the king’s servants done stabbed him, he’s down and they skedaddled; c’mon, ya gotta see this!”
Well, Amalickiah ordered his army to march on out and check on the king, and when they got there and found him layin' in his own blood, Amalickiah faked a big ol' fit, shoutin’: “Whoever loved the king, get out there and chase them servants down so we can make ‘em pay!”
Once the king’s loyal folks caught wind of that, they rushed out and started chasin’ after the king’s servants.
Now, when them servants saw an army hot on their trail, they were scared stiff and took off into the wild, makin' their way over to Zarahemla to join up with Ammon’s people.
And the army that chased after ‘em turned back, havin’ come up empty-handed; and just like that, Amalickiah, through his sneaky ways, won over the hearts of the folks.
Next day, he marched right on into the city of Nephi with his armies and took the place over.
Now the queen, when she got wind that the king had been done in—‘cause Amalickiah had sent a messenger to let her know that her man had been slain by his own crew, and that they’d chased after ‘em but it was all for naught, and they got away—
So when the queen got that message, she sent word to Amalickiah, askin’ him to cut the people of the city some slack and also wanted him to come on over to see her; and she wanted him to bring some witnesses to back up what he said ‘bout the king’s death.
Amalickiah took that same servant who done killed the king, along with all his crew, and marched right over to the queen where she was sittin’, and they all testified, tellin’ her that the king had been slain by his own servants, and they mentioned: “They’ve all taken off; don’t that say somethin’?”
And just like that, they satisfied the queen ‘bout the king's death.
Then Amalickiah went smooth talkin' the queen, took her for his wife, and through his schemin’ and with his crafty servants, he snagged the kingdom; shoot, he was named king all over the land, with all the Lamanites, Lemuelites, Ishmaelites, and every one of them Nephite dissenters in tow, all from the reign of Nephi right on down.
Now, these dissenters, they had all the same knowin' and teachings from the Nephites, sure did, but wouldn’t ya know it, not long after they split, they turned into even wilder and meaner than the Lamanites—soakin’ up all their traditions, slacking off, and indulgin’ in all sorts of wickedness; they just downright forgot ‘bout the Lord their God.
