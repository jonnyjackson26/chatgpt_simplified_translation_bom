Now, let me tell ya, back in the thirtieth year of them judges running things over the Nephites, after Moroni done read that letter from Helaman, he was just tickled pink 'bout how things was goin' for Helaman, what with all that land he managed to get back.
Shoot, he let everyone know 'round his neck of the woods so they could rejoice right along with him.
So, he up and sent Pahoran a letter, askin' him to wrangle up some folks to back up Helaman, so he could keep holdin' onto that part of the land that had been handed back to him like a miracle.
And as soon as Moroni sent that note down to Zarahemla, he started puttin' together a plan to get back the rest of the stuff and towns the Lamanites swiped from 'em.
Well, while Moroni was busy gettin' ready to take on them Lamanites, the folks in Nephihah—who came over from Moroni, Lehi, and Morianton—found themselves under attack by them Lamanites.
Yup, even them people who had to skedaddle away from Manti and the surrounding lands came on over and joined forces with the Lamanites.
And lemme tell ya, they was a heap of ‘em, growin' stronger every day, and under the command of Ammoron, they went at the Nephihah folks, and it turned into a huge ol' slaughter.
Their army was so big that the rest of Nephihah's people had no choice but to hightail it; they ended up joinin' up with Moroni’s army.
Now, Moroni figured they’d send folks to help out the city of Nephihah, knowin' it was a lot easier to keep that city safe from Lamanite hands than to try and get it back after it was lost, so he figured they'd be able to hold onto it just fine.
So he kept all his men in them spots he had just got back.
But when he saw Nephihah was in trouble, he got mighty upset and started doubting things since folks were actin' so wicked, wonderin’ if they were fixin' to fall into the Lamanites' hands, just like they’d done before.
And that was how all his main captains felt too. They was doubting and scratching their heads about how wicked the people had gotten, all 'cause the Lamanites was havin' themselves a good run against 'em.
And would ya believe it? Moroni was fit to be tied with the government, seein' how they didn’t give a hoot about keepin' their country free.
