Well, let me tell ya 'bout them words of Alma, y’know, what he spoke to the folks down in Gideon, all scribbled down by his own hand.
Now, this here is chapter 7.
Now, Christ is fixin' to be born from Mary—He’s gonna break them chains of death and carry the sins of His people—If y’all repent, get baptized, and keep the commandments, you’ll be livin’ the eternal life—Ain't no dirtiness gettin' into the kingdom of God—Humility, faith, hope, and good ol' charity are what y'all need. We're talkin' ‘bout way back in 83 B.C.
Well, listen here, my dear brothers, seein' as I got the chance to come on over and chat with ya, I’m gonna try and speak to ya in my own lingo; yep, straight from my mouth, ‘cause this here’s the first time I’m talkin' to ya with my words, seein' as I’ve been stuck over yonder at the judgment-seat doin' a whole lotta business and couldn't make it to y'all.
And I swear, I wouldn't have made it now if it weren't for somebody else takin' over that judgment business; and the Lord, in His good ol' mercy, allowed me to come see y’all.
And let me tell ya, I rolled in here hopin’ and prayin' that y’all had humbled yourselves before God, and that you kept askin' for His grace, that I’d find you blameless before Him, not in that awful mess our brethren got themselves into over at Zarahemla.
But bless the name of God, He’s let me know, shoot, I’m just tickled pink knowin' they’ve found their way back to His righteousness.
And I reckon, trustin' in the Spirit of God in me, I’m hopin' I’ll also get to feel joy ‘bout y’all; but I don’t want my joy to come from all that heartache I been feelin’ for the folks at Zarahemla, ‘cause, ya see, my joy comes after swimming through a whole lotta troubles and sorrow.
But I trust and hope that y’all ain't caught up in so much doubt like your kin; I trust y’all ain't puffed up with pride in your hearts; yep, I reckon y’all ain’t settin' your sights on money and the shiny things of this world; I trust you’re worshippin’ the real deal, the one true livin’ God, and that you’re lookin' forward to havin’ your sins wiped clean, with an everlasting faith that’s comin’ your way.
For listen here, I’m tellin’ ya there’s a heap of things comin'; but there’s one thing more important than all ‘em—get ready, ‘cause the time ain’t far off that the Redeemer’s gonna be livin' and walkin’ among His people.
Now I ain't sayin' He'll be among us while He's kickin' it in that mortal body; ‘cause I ain't had the Spirit tell me that’s how it’s gonna go down. Now, 'bout this here matter, I ain't sure; but I do know this much, the Lord God’s got the power to do anything that lines up with His word.
But here’s what the Spirit did tell me, sayin': Y’all better cry out to this people, sayin’—You gotta repent, prepare the way for the Lord, and walk straight in His paths; ‘cause the kingdom of heaven is near, and the Son of God’s fixin’ to show His face on this here earth.
And lookie here, He’s gonna be born of Mary, down in Jerusalem, where our forefathers were, her bein’ a virgin—a real special and chosen lady, who’s gonna be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and have herself a son, yep, even the Son of God.
He’s gonna step out sufferin’ all sorts of pains and trials and temptations; and this here’s how the word's gonna be fulfilled that says He’s pickin' up the pains and sicknesses of His folks.
And He’s takin’ on death, to break the bonds of death that hold His people tight; and He’s gonna take on their weaknesses, so His insides can be filled with mercy, in the flesh, so He’ll understand how to help His people with their troubles.
Now the Spirit knows all things; but the Son of God’s sufferin’ in the flesh so He can carry the sins of His people and wipe out their wrongdoings by the power of His rescue; and now, listen here, this is the testimony that’s in me.
Now I’m tellin’ ya, ya gotta repent and be born again; ‘cause the Spirit says if you ain’t born again, you can’t get into the kingdom of heaven; so come on and get baptized in repentance, so y’all can wash those sins away, and have faith in the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, who’s strong enough to save and cleanse from all them unrighteous deeds.
Yep, I'm sayin' come on now, don’t be scared, lay aside every sin that’s got ya stuck, the ones that’re draggin' ya down to destruction; so come on, step out, and show God you’re ready to turn from your sins and make a promise to keep His commandments, and witness this to Him today by goin’ into the baptism waters.
And whoever does this, and keeps God’s commandments after this here, they’ll remember what I’m tellin' ya, yep, they’ll remember I said they’ll have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit that testifies in me.
And now, my dear brothers, do y’all believe in these things? I’m tellin’ ya, I know you do; and how I know is by the Spirit that’s inside me. And now, ‘cause y’all got strong faith about this, ‘bout what I’ve been sayin’, it brings me so much joy.
‘Cause like I said from the start, I really wanted y’all to not be in the same pickle your brothers were, and turns out my hopes got fulfilled.
I can see y’all are walkin' the paths of righteousness; I can see you’re on the way to the kingdom of God; yep, I can tell you’re makin’ them paths straight.
I see that it's been shown to ya, by the word of His testimony, that He can’t walk along crooked paths; He don’t change from what He’s said; He don’t even have a shadow of turning left to right, or right to wrong; His course is one eternal round.
And He can't be livin’ in unholy places; ain't no filthiness or anything unclean gonna make it into the kingdom of God; so I’m tellin’ ya, the time's gonna come, yep, it’ll be at the last day, when the filthy folks gonna stay in their filthiness.
And now, my beloved brothers, I’ve told y’all these things to wake you up to your duty to God, so you can walk blameless before Him, and follow the holy path of God, the one you’ve been received into.
And now I reckon y'all should be humble, and all submissive-like, gentle; easy to talk to; full of patience and long-suffering; takin’ it easy in all things; bein’ diligent ‘bout keepin’ God’s commandments all the time; askin' for whatever you need, both spiritual and temporal; always thankin’ God for everything you do receive.
And make sure you’ve got faith, hope, and charity, and then you’ll always overflow in good works.
And may the Lord bless ya, keep your clothes clean, so at the end of the day, y’all can sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who’ve been around since this world got started, with your garments clean just like theirs, in the kingdom of heaven, never to leave again.
And now, my dear brothers, I’ve spoken these words to y’all according to the Spirit that testifies in me; and my soul is just holdin’ back joy ‘cause of all the hard work and attention y’all been givin’ to my words.
And now, may God’s peace rest on you, and your homes and land, and all your critters, and everything you own, your women and your kiddos, according to your faith and good works, from now on and forever. And there you have it. Amen.
