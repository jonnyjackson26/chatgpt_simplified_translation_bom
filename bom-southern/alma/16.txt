Well, it happened that in the eleventh year of them judges runnin' things for the folks of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there was just a whole lotta peace in good ol' Zarahemla. Ain't been no wars or fussin’ for quite a spell, till, on that same fifth day, a ruckus of war was hollered all over the land.
Now, lemme tell ya, the armies o' them Lamanites come sneakin' in from the wilderness side, headin' right for Ammonihah, and they started takin' folks out and messin' up the city good.
Well, before the Nephites could whip up a decent army to push them Lamanites right on out, they done wrecked the poor folks in Ammonihah and grabbed some more folks 'round Noah too, takin' 'em off into the wild.
Now, the Nephites were fixin' to rescue those who got carried away into the wilderness, you see. 
So the chief captain of the Nephite army—his name was Zoram, and he had two young’uns, Lehi and Aha—well, Zoram and his boys, knowin' that Alma was the priest in charge of the church, and hearin’ he had the spirit of prophecy, went to him to ask where the good Lord wanted ‘em to go lookin' for their kinfolk snatched by them Lamanites.
And sure enough, Alma asked the Lord about it. Then he come back and said: "Listen here, them Lamanites are gonna cross the river Sidon down south, way beyond Manti. Y’all gonna meet ‘em on the east side of that river, and that’s where the Lord’ll hand over your kin who got took by them Lamanites."
So Zoram and his boys packed it up and crossed that river Sidon with their army, marchin’ on out beyond Manti into the southern wilderness, which was on the east side of that river.
Then they stumbled on them Lamanites, who was scatterin’ and runnin’ off into the wild; they wrangled their captured kin back, and bless your heart, not a single one had been lost in all that mess. They brought ‘em back to their own lands.
And that’s how the eleventh year of those judges wrapped up, with them Lamanites kicked outta the land, and the folks in Ammonihah all wiped out; yep, every last one of them Ammonihahites was gone, and so was their mighty city they thought couldn’t be put to ruin by no one.
But lo and behold, in just one day it was left lookin’ sad and empty; and the scavengers, like dogs and wild critters, were havin’ a feast on the remains.
But after many days, their bodies piled up on the ground, covered up just a little. And it smelled so bad that folks didn’t wanna go movin’ into Ammonihah for many years. They started callin’ it the Desolation of Nehors, 'cause that’s who got killed there, and their lands was left in ruin.
And those Lamanites didn’t come back to stir up any trouble for the Nephites till the fourteenth year of them judges bein’ in charge. So for three whole years, the Nephites enjoyed some real good peace across the land.
Alma and Amulek hit the road preachin’ repentance in their temples, sanctuaries, and synagogues, just like them Jews doin’ it.
And all who wanted to listen to ‘em, well, they got the good word of God shared with ‘em, no favorites played, just keepin’ at it all the time.
So Alma, Amulek, and a whole lotta others who were picked for the job went out preachin’ the good word all over the place. The church spread out, takin’ root all 'round the lands and among the people of Nephi.
Now there wasn’t any rich or poor among ‘em; the Lord poured out His Spirit all over, settin’ up the minds and hearts of folks to be ready to take in the word they’d be taught when He showed up—
So they wouldn't harden their hearts to it, be all doubtful, and end up in a heap of trouble, but instead take the word with gladness, just like a branch bein’ grafted into the true vine, and find some rest in the Lord their God.
Now them priests that went out among the folks were preachin’ against all them lies and deceits, envies, fights, and mean things like robbin’, murderin’, cheatin’ on their spouses, and all sorts of wickedness, shoutin’ that these shenanigans just ain't right—
Talkin’ about stuff that was comin’ soon; yep, preachin’ about the Son of God and His sufferin’, death, and the resurrection of the dead.
Lots of folks was curious ‘bout where the Son of God was gonna show up, and they was taught he’d come to ‘em after he rose from the grave; and boy howdy, they heard that with joyful hearts.
And after the church got settlin’ down nicely all over the land—beatin’ the devil and preachin’ the pure word of God everywhere, with the Lord showerin' blessings on the people—thus wrapped up the fourteenth year of them judges runnin’ the folks of Nephi.
