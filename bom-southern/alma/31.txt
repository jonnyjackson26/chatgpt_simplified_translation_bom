Well, it so happened that after all that fuss with Korihor, Alma got word that the Zoramites were messin’ up the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, their big chief, was leadin’ folks to bow down to some ol’ stone idols. This made Alma’s heart just ache somethin’ fierce, thinkin' ‘bout all the folks bein' so wayward.
It sure bothered Alma somethin’ awful to see his people all caught up in sin, so his heart was heavy with sorrow over how the Zoramites turned their backs on the Nephites.
Now them Zoramites got themselves gathered up in a place they called Antionum, over yonder east of the land of Zarahemla, close enough to the beach, south of Jershon, which was right there next to the wild lands full of Lamanites.
Them Nephites were worried sick that the Zoramites would start talkin’ with the Lamanites, and that would mean real trouble and loss for the Nephites.
And since preachin’ the good word had a knack for gettin’ folks to do what’s right—heck, it worked better on the people’s minds than any sword fight ever could—Alma figured it was high time to show ‘em the power of God’s word.
So he rounded up Ammon, Aaron, and Omner; left Himni back at the church in Zarahemla; but took them other three along with Amulek and Zeezrom, who were hangin’ out in Melek; and he also brought along two of his boys.
Now, he didn’t take his oldest boy, Helaman, but he took Shiblon and Corianton with him to preach to those Zoramites.
See, the Zoramites had walked away from the Nephites, so they’d heard God’s word preached before.
But boy, did they get it all twisted; they weren't keepin’ God’s commandments or botherin’ with Moses' laws at all.
They also didn’t keep up with the church sittin’ down to pray and ask God for help every day so they wouldn’t get tempted.
Yep, they messed up the Lord’s ways in a whole heap of ways; so, that’s why Alma and his pals went to tell ‘em the word.
When they got into town, wouldn’t you know it, they were shocked to find the Zoramites had built them synagogues. They gathered up on just one day of the week, which they called the day of the Lord, and they worshipped in a way Alma and his boys had never seen before.
They’d got a spot built right in the middle of their synagogue, a raised platform all tall and fancy, just big enough for one fella to stand there.
So, anyone who wanted to worship had to climb up there, throw their hands to the sky, and holler out loud:
Holy, holy God! We believe you’re the real deal, and we reckon you’re holy, and we know you used to be a spirit, still are, and always will be.
Holy God, we think you’ve separated us from our own kinfolk; we ain’t buyin’ their old traditions passed down by their foolish daddies; instead, we’re believein’ you chose us to be your holy kids, and you told us there ain't gonna be no Christ.
But you’re the same yesterday, today, and always; you picked us to be saved, while everyone else around us is chosen to drop into hellfire; for that holiness, we thank you, God! And we also thank you for not lettin’ us get led astray by those silly traditions of our brethren that tie ‘em down to believe in Christ, which leads ‘em away from you, our God.
And once more, we thank ya, O God, for makin’ us a chosen and holy crowd. Amen.
Next thing ya know, after Alma and his crew listened to all them prayers, they were just blown away.
Every single fella went up there and said the same ol’ prayers.
Now, the folks called that spot Rameumptom, which means the holy stand, y’see.
From that stand, every man gave the same thanks to God, expressin’ gratitude that they were handpicked by Him, and that He didn’t lead ‘em astray by their folks’ traditions, and their hearts weren’t off chasin' things to come they didn’t understand.
After all the folks got done with their thanks like that, they headed back home, not sayin’ another peep ‘bout their God until they gathered up again at that holy stand, to give thanks their own way.
When Alma saw all this, his heart was just torn apart; he knew they were bein’ wicked and downright perverse; their hearts, he saw, were set on gold, silver, and all sorts of fancy stuff.
He noticed too that they were puffin’ up with pride like a rooster on a fence.
So he raised his voice to heaven, cryin’ out: Oh Lord, how long you gonna let your servants stick around down here in the flesh, watchin’ all this awful wickedness among folks?
Look here, God, they holler out to you, but their hearts are wrapped up in pride. They shout to you while bein’ all puffed up with frivolous fancy stuff.
Look at their expensive clothes and their fancy hairdos, their shiny bracelets and gold ornaments; they’re all decked out in precious things and still cryin’ out to you sayin’—We thank you, oh God, for bein’ a chosen people while others are doomed.
And they say you told ‘em there won’t be no Christ.
Oh Lord God, how long you gonna let this craziness and lack of faith run wild among these folks? Give me strength, Lord, so I can handle my own frailties. I am weak, and seein’ such wickedness among these folks hurts my heart.
Oh Lord, my heart's achin' real bad; please comfort my soul in Christ. Lord, grant me strength to endure with patience all these troubles comin’ my way ‘cause of these people's iniquities.
Oh Lord, bring comfort to my soul, help me and my fellow laborers—Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Amulek and Zeezrom, too, and my two sons—yes, please comfort all of ‘em, Lord. Comfort their souls in Christ, too.
Can you give ‘em strength to bear the troubles coming their way ‘cause of this sorry mess?
Oh Lord, we’re askin’ that we may have success in bringin’ ‘em back to you in Christ.
Look, Lord, those souls are precious, many of ‘em our kin; so we ask for power and wisdom to help our brethren find their way back to you.
Well, after Alma finished sayin’ all this, he clapped his hands on everyone with him. And y’all wouldn’t believe it—when he clapped them hands, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
Then they split up, not worryin’ ‘bout what to eat or drink, or what clothes to wear.
And the Lord took care of ‘em, so they wouldn’t go hungry or thirsty; and He gave ‘em strength, so they wouldn’t suffer no troubles, except for bein’ swallowed up in the joy of Christ. And that’s how it went, all on account of Alma’s prayer, since he prayed in faith.
