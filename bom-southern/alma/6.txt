Well, after Alma finished chattin' with the folks at the church in Zarahemla, he went 'n ordained them some priests and elders, layin' his hands on 'em just like God wanted, to keep an eye on things and run the church right.
Now, if someone didn’t belong to the church but felt real sorry for their sins, they'd get baptized for that repentance and then be welcomed on in.
But let me tell ya, if folks did belong to the church and didn’t bother to repent or humble themselves before the Big Guy upstairs—those who were all puffed up with pride—they got kicked out, and their names got scratched off the list of the righteous.
So, they started settin’ things straight with the order of the church over in Zarahemla.
I want y’all to know that the good word of God was out there for everyone, and nobody was kept from joinin’ together to listen to it.
Still, the children of God were told they oughta gather up often and join in some fastin' and serious prayin' for the souls of those who hadn’t met the Lord yet.
Now, it so happened that after Alma laid down these rules, he took off from the church over in Zarahemla, crossin’ the river Sidon and headin’ into the valley of Gideon. They had a little city built there, called just that, named after a fella who met an unfortunate end at the hands of Nehor's sword.
So, Alma went and started tellin' the good word of God to the church set up in the valley of Gideon, followin’ the truth passed down from his folks, along with the spirit of prophecy stirrin’ inside him, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was fixin’ to save folks from their sins, along with the holy order he was called to. And that's how it’s written, y’all. Amen.
