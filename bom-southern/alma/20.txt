Well, it all started when them folks got themselves a church in that part of the world, and King Lamoni was hopin’ Ammon would tag along with him to Nephi to introduce him to his daddy.
Then the good Lord spoke to Ammon, sayin’: "You best steer clear of Nephi, 'cause that king’s fixin’ to hunt you down; you’re better off headin’ to Middoni, ‘cause your brother Aaron, along with Muloki and Ammah, are sittin’ in the pokey."
When Ammon heard this news, he turned to Lamoni and said: "Hey now, my brother and the others are stuck in Middoni, and I’m fixin’ to go free ‘em."
Lamoni looked at Ammon and said: "Well, shoot, I reckon with the Lord’s strength, you can do anything. But hey, I’m comin’ with you to Middoni, 'cause the king there, name of Antiomno, is a pal of mine; I’ll sweet-talk him into lettin’ your brothers out of jail. Now, tell me, who clued you in on your brothers bein’ in prison?"
Ammon replied, "Ain’t nobody told me but God; He said to me—Get on over there and free your brothers, ‘cause they’re stuck in the slammer over in Middoni."
Well, Lamoni heard that and got his helpin’ hands busy gettin' the horses and chariots ready.
Then he told Ammon: "Let’s hit the road to Middoni together, and I’ll have a word with the king to get your brothers sprung."
So as Ammon and Lamoni were makin’ their way, they crossed paths with Lamoni’s daddy, the big cheese over the whole shebang.
And Ole King Lamoni asked him: "What in tarnation made y’all miss the feast when I threw a big ol’ party for my sons and folks?"
He went on to say: "Where ya headin' with this Nephite fella, huh? He’s one of them children of a liar, ain’t he?"
Lamoni, not wantin’ to ruffle any feathers, told his daddy all ‘bout where they were off to and why he didn’t show up to that feast.
When Lamoni finished spillin’ the beans, surprise, surprise—his daddy was hotter than a pepper sprout, and he said: "Lamoni, you goin’ to rescue them Nephites, children of a liar? Look, that fella robbed our kin, and now them young’uns are back messin’ with us, trying to snow us and swipe our stuff again."
Then King Lamoni ordered: "You best take Ammon out back and take care of him with a sword. And don’t you dare go to Middoni; you get your rear back to Ishmael with me."
But Lamoni replied, "No way, I ain’t takin’ out Ammon, and I’m not goin’ back to Ishmael; I’m headin’ to Middoni to free Ammon’s brothers, ‘cause I know they’re stand-up guys and true prophets of the Almighty."
When Lamoni’s daddy heard that, he was hotter than a two-dollar pistol and pulled his sword, lookin' to take his son out himself.
But Ammon stepped up and said: "Now hold on there, you can’t be layin’ a hand on your son; but truth be told, it’d be better he take a fall than you, since he’s turned his heart around. If you throw a fit and fall right now, ain't nothin’ gonna save your soul."
He continued, "You really oughta hold back; if you take out your innocent son, his blood’ll be callin’ for vengeance from the good Lord, and who knows, you might just lose your own soul in the process."
When Ammon shared that, the king answered back, "I know if I go takin’ my son out, it’s innocent blood I’m spillin’; you’re the one who’s lookin’ to end him."
So he reached out to take care of Ammon. But Ammon held his ground, deflectin’ the blows and knockin’ the king’s arm so he couldn’t hardly lift it.
When the king realized Ammon could’ve laid him low, he started beggin’ Ammon to spare his own life.
But Ammon raised his sword and told him: "Listen here, I’ll take you down unless you agree to let my brothers outta prison."
The king, scared stiff for his own hide, said: "If you let me live, I swear I’ll give ya whatever you ask, even half the kingdom, you hear?"
When Ammon spotted that the old king was givin’ in, he said: "Alright, if you’ll let my brothers outta jail, and let Lamoni keep his kingdom, and none of y'all fuss about it, then I won’t take your life; but otherwise, I’m fixin’ to bring you down."
Once Ammon said that, the king started to feel mighty relieved ‘bout still bein’ alive.
Then when he realized Ammon wasn’t out for blood, and saw the good heart he had for Lamoni, he was flabbergasted and said: "Since this is all you wanted—to let your brothers go and keep my son Lamoni in charge—why, I’ll agree to that! He can keep his throne for as long as time lasts, and I won’t get in his way no more."
And he added, "I’ll also agree to let your brothers outta the slammer, and I want you and your brothers to come on over to my kingdom; I’d sure love to see you, what with me bein’ so amazed at what y’all are sayin’ and what my boy Lamoni’s been spillin’ too."
Then Ammon and Lamoni kept movin’ towards Middoni, and Lamoni caught the king’s fancy, so they brought Ammon’s brothers right outta prison.
When Ammon met up with them, his heart was heavy, seein’ they were bare and beaten up real bad from bein’ tied up. And they’d been through all sorts of hard times—hungry, thirsty, and a world of hurt; but bless their hearts, they kept their spirits up.
Now, turns out, they’d landed in the clutches of a rougher crowd, so them folks wouldn’t listen to a lick of sense; they’d kicked ‘em out and whipped ‘em and drove ‘em from place to place till they ended up in Middoni. That’s where they finally got locked up good and tight for days on end, and thanks to Lamoni and Ammon, they got free at last.
