Now, in the good ol’ law of Mosiah, every feller wadin’ in the judge business, or any who got themselves thrown into that role, was supposed to pocket some coin based on how long they worked fixin’ to judge folks brought up before ‘em.
Now if a man owed his buddy some cash, and he just up and refused to pay, well, folks went runnin’ to the judge complainin’. Then that judge would get right to work, sendin’ folks out to drag that man up before him, and he’d sort it out based on the law and the evidence laid out against him. So, that man had no choice but to pay up what he owed, or risk gettin' laid bare or tossed outta the community like a common thief or somethin’.
And the judge, bless his heart, earned his pay based on his time workin’—that’d be a senine of gold per day, or a senum of silver, which is worth the same as a senine. And this is what the law called for.
Now here’s the scoop on the different coins of gold and silver they had, based on what they was worth. The Nephites had their own names for it, ‘cause they didn’t go addin’ and measurin’ like them Jews down in Jerusalem; instead, they changed it up to fit their own folks’ brains and needs as times changed, right up until them judges took charge ‘neath King Mosiah.
Now the reckonin’ goes like this—a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.
Then you got a senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.
Now a senum of silver was worth a senine of gold, workin’ just fine for a measure of barley, and for any other grain too. 
Now that seon of gold? Well, it was worth double a senine.
And if you ask ‘bout a shum of gold? That one was twice what a seon’s worth.
That limnah of gold? It was worth the whole shootin' match.
And an amnor of silver? That one counted as two senums.
An ezrom of silver was worth four senums.
And then there’s an onti—well, it was worth more than all ‘em put together.
Now here’s how the little numbers shook out—
A shiblon is half a senum; so, you’d call that a shiblon for half a measure of barley.
And a shiblum? That’s half a shiblon.
Then a leah is half of a shiblum.
Now that’s how they kept count.
And an antion of gold, well, that was tallied as three shiblons.
Now, folks was all workin’ just to line their pockets, since they got paid based on what they did, they stirred up a ruckus, trouble, and all kinds of wickedness, just so they could get more work and pull in that sweet, sweet cash off the cases brought to 'em; that’s when they got folks riled up against Alma and Amulek.
And this here Zeezrom started to poke at Amulek, askin’: "Can you answer me a few questions I got for ya?" Zeezrom was a slick fella, knowin’ all the tricks to lead folks astray, so he went on to say to Amulek: "Will ya answer the questions I throw your way?"
And Amulek replied: "Sure will, if it jives with the Spirit of the Lord in me; ain’t gonna say nothin' that goes against the Lord’s Spirit." Zeezrom then said: “Well, lookee here, I got six onties of silver, and I’ll hand ‘em over if you deny that there’s a Supreme Being.”
Now Amulek shot back: "Oh, you child of hell, why you temptin’ me? Don’t you know the righteous don’t fall for such tricks?"
"Do you really think there ain’t no God? I’m here to tell ya, no way, you know there’s a God, but you love that money more than him."
"And you’ve lied before God about me. You said, ‘Look at these six onties, they’re worth a heap, I’ll give ‘em to ya’—but all along you wanted me to deny my true livin’ God just so you could take me down. Now, for that nasty trickery, you’ll get what’s comin’ to ya."
And Zeezrom asked him: "You’re sayin’ there’s a true and livin’ God?"
And Amulek replied: "Yep, there’s a true and livin’ God."
Then Zeezrom asked: "Is there more than one God?"
And Amulek said, "Nope."
Zeezrom tried again: "How you know all this?"
And Amulek answered: "An angel told me."
Then Zeezrom asked again: "Who’s the one comin’? Is it the Son of God?"
And Amulek replied, "Yep."
Then Zeezrom pushed further: "Is he gonna save folks while they’re still stuck in their sins?" And Amulek told him: "I declare to you, he won’t, ‘cause it just can’t be that he goes back on his own word."
Then Zeezrom turned to the crowd: "Y’all remember this here, 'cause he said there’s only one God; there’s talk of the Son of God comin’, but he won’t save folks—like he’s got any right to tell God what to do."
And Amulek shot back at him: "Now, hold up, you’ve lied, ‘cause you’re sayin’ I spoke like I had the right to boss God around just ‘cause I said he can’t save people while they’re sittin’ in their sins."
"And I’m tellin’ you again, he can’t save ‘em in their sins; I can’t deny his word, and he says no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; so how in the world can y’all expect to be saved, if you don’t inherit that kingdom of heaven? Can’t get saved if you stay stuck in your sins."
Then Zeezrom pushed him once more: "Is the Son of God the real deal, the Eternal Father?"
And Amulek answered him: "Yep, he sure is the very Eternal Father of heaven and earth, and everythin’ in ‘em; he’s the start and the finish, the first and the last;
And he’s comin’ to the earth to save his people, takin’ on the wrongdoings of them who believe in his name; those folks are the ones who’ll see eternal life, and salvation ain’t comin' to nobody else.
So the wicked are gonna stay like folks who didn’t get no redemption made, except for the breakin’ of death’s hold; ‘cause look here, the day’s comin’ when all folks will rise from the dead and stand before God, gettin’ judged on what they’ve done.
Now, there’s this kind of death we call temporal death, and the death of Christ’ll break the hold of this here temporal death, and everybody’ll stand up again from it.
The spirit and body gonna be put back together in their good, old form; all the limbs and joints gonna be fixed up right just like we are now; and we’re gonna stand before God, knowin’ just like we know now, and have a clear memory of all our sins.
Now, this here restoration is gonna come to everyone, old ‘n young, bond ‘n free, men ‘n women, even the wicked and the righteous; and ain’t even a hair on their heads gonna get lost; everythin’ gonna get restored to its perfect form, just like it is now, or in the body, and they’ll be brought to stand for judgment before Christ the Son, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged on what they've done, whether it was good or bad.
So listen close, I’ve been yappin’ at ya ‘bout the death of this here mortal body, and the resurrection of it too. I’m tellin’ ya this mortal body’s gonna get raised to an immortal body, from death, right from the first death into life, so they can’t die no more; spirits gonna join up with their bodies, never to be separated; makin’ the whole mess spiritual and immortal, so they don’t see no decay.
Now, when Amulek wrapped up these words, folks started feelin’ all kinds of astonished, and Zeezrom? He was shakin’ in his boots. And that was the end of Amulek’s words, or at least, that’s all I been keepin' track of.
