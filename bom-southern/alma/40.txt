Well now, my boy, I gotta tell ya a little more ‘bout this here resurrection business, ‘cause I can see it’s weighin’ heavy on your mind about what happens to folks after they kick the bucket.
Now listen here, I’m tellin’ ya, there ain’t no resurrection—let me put it this way, this ol’ mortal body ain’t gonna get all immortal and uncorrupted ‘til after Christ makes His grand entrance.
See here, He’s the one who’ll get us all back up again. But let me remind ya, my son, that resurrection ain’t happenin’ yet. I’m about to share a little mystery with ya; but truth be told, there’s a heap of mysteries out there that only God knows. But I got one thing I’ve been askin’ God ‘bout real hard, and it’s all ‘bout the resurrection.
Now, there’s a set time when every last one of us is gonna rise up from the dead. When that time rolls around, nobody knows, ‘cept God, who’s got it all marked on His calendar.
Now it don’t reckon if it’s gonna happen one time, or maybe two or three; it ain’t none of my business, ‘cause God’s got it all figured out, and it’s just enough for me to know we’re all gonna rise up when the time is right.
Now there’s a little gap between when we kick the bucket and when we get back up again.
So I’m wonderin’, what in tarnation happens to folks’ souls from the moment they draw their last breath till they rise again? 
Now whether there’s more than one time for folks to rise don’t really matter to me; ‘cause everybody don’t up and die at the same time, and that’s how it is; everything’s like one day for God, and time’s just a thing we measure for us humans.
So there’s a time set for people to rise from the dead, and there’s a gap between death and resurrection. Now, I’m real curious ‘bout what happens to folks during that gap, and I’ve been askin’ the Lord real hard to figure it out; and this is what I do know.
And when that time comes when we all get up, then we’ll see that God knows all the times He’s set for mankind.
Now, ‘bout what happens to the soul between death and when you rise again—well, I got some news from an angel: as soon as folks leave this ol’ body, they all go home to God who gave ‘em life.
Then, all them righteous folks? They’re gonna be welcomed into a happy place we call paradise—a nice little spot to rest, full of peace, where they can lay down all their troubles and worries.
But then there’s the wicked ones, yeah, them who chose the wrong path; they don’t get no part of the Lord’s spirit. They picked their misdeeds over good, and the devil took ‘em right over. They’ll be thrown into outer darkness; it’ll be a cryin’ and a moanin’, and a gnashin’ of teeth, all ‘cause of their own dang wickedness, lettin’ the devil lead ‘em ‘round.
Now that’s the state of those wicked souls, sittin’ in darkness, all afraid and lookin’ to feel God’s fierce anger comin’ down on ‘em; and they stay there, just like the good folks in paradise, ‘til it’s time for ‘em to rise.
Now some folks think this happy state and this miserable state before the resurrection is some kinda early resurrection. I reckon you could maybe call it that, raisin’ the spirit or soul and sendin’ ‘em off to happiness or misery, based on what’s been said.
And I’ve heard folks talk about a first resurrection, the rising up of everyone who ever was or ever will be, right to when Christ rose from the dead.
Now, we can’t be thinkin’ this first resurrection means that’s when the souls get sent off to happiness or misery. You best not be thinkin’ that’s what it’s all about.
Listen here, I’m tellin’ ya, it ain’t that; it’s all ‘bout reunitin’ that soul with its body, stretchin’ all the way back to Adam and right up to Christ’s resurrection.
Now, as to whether those souls and bodies we’re talkin’ ‘bout all reunite at the same time, the wicked and the righteous alike, I ain’t got an answer for ya; but I can say they all gonna rise up before the folks who pass after Christ’s resurrection.
Now, son, I’m not sayin’ their rise happens right when Christ rises; but I think it’s my opinion that the righteous folks’ souls and bodies get back together at Christ’s resurrection and His climbin’ up to heaven.
But whether it’s right then or later, I can’t say; but I know for sure there’s a gap between death and the body risin’, and a soul stayin’ happy or in misery ‘til God’s got the time set for the dead to rise and get back together, body and soul, standin’ before God to be judged ‘cordin’ to what they done.
Yeah, that’s what brings ‘round the restoring of everythin’ the prophets been preachin’ ‘bout.
The soul gets back in the body, and the body reunites with the soul; every last limb and joint is gonna be put back right; even a single hair on the head won’t be missin’; everythin’ is gonna come back to its perfect state.
And now, son, this is what them prophets been talkin’ ‘bout—the restoring.
And then the righteous folks will shine like stars in God’s kingdom.
But don’t you be fooled, ‘cause a terrible death is comin’ for them wicked; they’re gonna be dead to all things that are good and righteous; they’re unclean, and the Lord ain’t lettin’ no unclean thing in His kingdom, so they’ll be tossed out, gettin’ the fruits of their bad deeds, and drinkin’ the bitter dregs of a rough ol’ cup.
