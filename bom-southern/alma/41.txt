In the Resurrection, folks come back to either a never-ending joy or a heap of misery—ain’t no way wickedness ever brought happiness—Carnal folks are just wanderin’ without God in this world—Every single person gets back what they gained when they were livin’. 'Bout 74 B.C.
Now listen here, son, I got a thing or two to say 'bout that restoration we been jawin’ about; some folks done twisted the good book, and they’re way off track 'cause of it. And I can tell your mind's been a bit troubled too, thinkin' on it. But don’t worry, I'm gonna break it down for ya.
I reckon, son, that the whole restoration plan fits right in with God’s justice; it's mighty important that everything gets put back in its rightful place. Now look, it’s just and necessary, 'cause of the power and resurrection of Christ, that a person’s soul gets reunited with its body, and every piece of that body gets back together like it should.
And it’s only fair with God’s justice that folks get judged by their actions; if their good deeds were good in this life, and their hearts were pointed in the right direction, then they oughta be brought back to what’s good come the last day.
But if their deeds were bad, they’ll get brought back to that bad. So, everything’s gonna be put back right, all things to their natural state—mortality turned to immortality, corruption to incorruption—yanked up to endless happiness to enjoy the kingdom of God, or dragged down to endless misery to hang out in the devil’s kingdom, one on this side, the other on that side—
One’s lifted up to happiness 'cause they were after that happiness, and the other’s sent to evil 'cause they chased after that bad stuff; for just like they wanted to do evil all day long, that’s exactly what they’ll get when the night rolls around.
Now, the same goes for the other fella. If he’s truly turned away from his sins, and wanted what’s right to the very end, then he’ll get rewarded for his righteousness.
These are the folks that God’s brought back; yep, them’s the ones who’ve been pulled outta that never-ending dark night; and so they stand or fall on their own; for there they are, their own judges, choosin’ between good and evil.
Now, God’s decrees can’t be changed; so the path’s wide open for anyone who wants to stroll down it and get saved.
And now listen here, my son, don’t go throwin’ in your lot with sin no more on these doctrines you’ve already dabbled in.
Don’t go thinkin’ 'cause we talk about restoration that you can go from sin to happiness. Listen close, wickedness ain’t never brought happiness.
And now, son, all folks stuck in their carnal ways are filled with bitterness and shackled in sin; they’re wanderin’ without God in this world, and they done walked away from the nature of God; so they ain't in a place that feels like happiness at all.
And now, take heed—does restoration mean takin’ somethin’ that’s natural and shovin’ it into an unnatural state, or turnin’ it upside down from what it’s meant to be?
Oh, son, that ain't it; the word restoration means bringin’ back evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for good; righteous for righteous; just for just; merciful for merciful.
So, son, be sure you show mercy to your brothers; be fair, judge right, and keep doin’ good; and if you follow this advice, you’ll reap your reward; yep, you’ll get mercy back; you’ll see justice come back around; you’ll have right judgment comin’ back to ya; and you’ll be rewarded for the good you did.
'Cause what you send out will come back to you, and get restored; so that there word restoration shows up the sinner real well, and don’t justify 'em one bit.
