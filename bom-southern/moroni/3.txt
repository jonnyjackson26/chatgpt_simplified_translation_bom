Well now, them elders get together and lay hands on folks to make 'em priests and teachers. 'Bout A.D. 401 to 421, y’know?
Way them disciples, callin' themselves the elders o' the church, went 'bout ordaining them priests and teachers— 
First off, they got down on their knees and prayed to the Big Man upstairs in Jesus' name, then proceeded to lay their hands on 'em, sayin':
"In Jesus' name, I’m ordaining ya as a priest (or if yer a teacher, reckon I’m makin’ ya a teacher) to go out and preach about turnin' away from sins and finding forgiveness through Jesus Christ, holdin' tight to your faith in His name till the very end. Amen."
And that’s just how they went 'bout ordaining those priests and teachers, based on the talents and callings God’s given to folks; they did it all by the power of the Holy Ghost that was workin' in ‘em.
