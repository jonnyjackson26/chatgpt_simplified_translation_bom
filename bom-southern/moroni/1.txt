Well, I’m Moroni, and after finishin’ up that whole story about Jared’s folks, I figured I’d be done writin’. But shoot, I ain’t kickin’ the bucket just yet, so I’m keepin’ my name under wraps ‘round them Lamanites, ‘cause they might just wanna do me in.
Now listen here, their fights are hotter than a pepper sprout, and ‘cause they can’t stand each other, they’ll take out any Nephite who won’t renounce Christ right quick.
As for me, Moroni, I ain’t backin’ down from Jesus; so I’m just wanderin’ ‘round wherever I can to stay alive and kickin’.
So, I’m tossin’ down a few more words, even though I thought I’d be done; guess I’m not write-off quite yet. I’m hopin’ these bits might do some good for my kin, the Lamanites, one of these days, if it’s God’s plan.
