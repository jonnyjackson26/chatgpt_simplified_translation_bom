Well, let me break it down for ya:
The way them elders and priests go 'bout servin' up the good ol' bread that stands for Christ’s flesh and blood to the folks at church is laid out real nice-like; they do it just like Jesus told 'em to, so we’re certain it’s done right; and that elder or priest, he went on and served it up—
And they all got down on their knees with the congregation, prayin' to the Father in Jesus's name, sayin':
Hey God, the big ol’ Eternal Father up there, we’re askin’ ya, in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, to bless this bread and make it special for all y’all who eat it; so they can chow down thinkin’ ‘bout your Son's body, and promise ya, O God, the big ol’ Eternal Father, that they’re fixin’ to take on your Son’s name, always keep Him in mind, and stick to the commandments He set forth for 'em, so they can always have His Spirit hangin' around with 'em. Amen.
