Well now, let me tell ya how they handlin' that sacramental wine, y'hear? This here's what went down:
They grabbed that cup and said, 
“Hey there, Almighty Father up above, we’re askin’ ya, in the name of Your boy, Jesus Christ, to bless this here wine for all those folks sippin' on it, so they remember the blood He shed for 'em; so they can show ya, oh Lord, that they’re keepin' Him in their hearts and always thinkin' ‘bout Him, so they can have His Spirit hangin’ out with ‘em. Amen.”
