Well now, when it comes to baptism, let me tell ya, folks who’re truly sorry for their mess-ups get dunked and welcomed into the fold—members of the church who really mean it get a clean slate—meetings run smooth-like ‘cause the Holy Ghost is in charge. This here’s about A.D. 401 to 421.
Now, I gotta say a little somethin’ ‘bout baptism. Ya see, them elders, priests, and teachers got baptized, and it ain’t like they just jumped in there without showin’ they was ready—had to have somethin’ to show they was worth it.
They didn’t let just anyone get baptized, neither. Folks had to come in with a broken heart and a real contrite spirit, and they had to tell the church they was genuinely sorry for all their sins.
Nope, nobody got dunked unless they took on the name of Christ, swearin' up and down they was gonna serve Him ‘til the end.
Once they got baptized and cleaned up real good by the power of the Holy Ghost, they joined the bunch known as the church of Christ; their names were written down so folks could remember ‘em and feed ‘em the good word of God, keepin’ ‘em on the straight and narrow, ever watchful and prayin’, leanin’ on the good deeds of Christ, who’s the start and the finish of their faith.
The church folks gathered together a whole lot to fast and pray, takin’ time to chitchat ‘bout their souls’ well-bein’.
And they sure met up often to break bread and share some wine, all in remembrance of the Lord Jesus.
They were serious ‘bout keepin’ sin outta their midst, and if anyone was found gettin’ into trouble, three witnesses from the church would put ‘em on blast before the elders. If they didn’t change their ways and confess, their names got scratched off the list, and they weren’t counted among Christ’s people no more.
But any time they turned around and asked for forgiveness, really meanin’ it, they got a pass.
And the church sure held their meetings guided by the Spirit, full of the Holy Ghost’s power; whenever the Holy Ghost led ‘em to preach, encourage, pray, plead, or sing, you bet they followed that lead.
