Well, lemme tell ya, Jesus done gave those twelve Nephite fellers the power to hand out the Holy Ghost like it was candy. 'Round A.D. 401–21.
Now, here’s what Jesus told 'em, the ones he picked out, while he laid them hands on 'em— 
He called 'em by name, sayin': Y’all gonna be askin’ the Father in my name, real powerful like; and once ya do that, you’ll get the power to lay your hands on folks, and you’ll be givin' ‘em the Holy Ghost; and you’ll do it in my name, 'cause that’s how my apostles roll.
So, Jesus said all this to ‘em when he first showed up; the crowd didn’t catch on, but those disciples sure did; and all the folks they laid their hands on? Well, they got the Holy Ghost right then and there.
