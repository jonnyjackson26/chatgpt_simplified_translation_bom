Well now, listen here, the Lord's askin': Did I just up and throw ya out, or am I done with ya for good? Now tell me, where’s the papers from your mama’s divorce? Who’d I kick ya to the curb for, or which of my folks did I sell ya off to? I mean, who exactly did I hand ya over to? Lookie here, it’s your own mess that got ya sold off, and your mama’s upset ‘cause of the trouble you caused.
So, when I showed up, there wasn’t a soul around; when I hollered, there wasn’t a single body to answer back. Hey, Israel, is my hand too short to save ya, or am I just too weak to help? Take a gander, when I give a shout, I dry up the sea, turn rivers into dry ol’ deserts, and the fish start stinkin’ ‘cause the water’s gone and they’re croakin’ from thirst.
I drape the sky in darkness, ain’t no sunshine ‘round, and I make it look like we’re wearin’ sackcloth up there.
The Lord God gave me a good way with words, teachin’ me how to speak just what you need to hear, Israel. When y’all are plum tuckered out, He’s up bright and early, wakin’ me up to listen real good like a learned fella.
The Lord God opened my ear, and I didn’t put up no fuss, nor did I turn tail and run.
I bared my back to the one swingin’ the whip and let ‘em take the hair from my face. I sure didn’t shy away from the shame or the spit.
The Lord’s got my back, so I ain't gonna be ashamed. I’ve got my face set like a rock, and I know I won’t have to hang my head.
Now the Lord’s close by, and He’s the one who’s makin’ things right for me. Who’s gonna take me on? Let’s stand up together. Who’s my enemy? Let ‘em come on over, and I’ll set ‘em straight with the words from my mouth.
The Lord God’s my helper. And all them folks thinkin’ to condemn me, well, they’re gonna fade away like old clothes, and the moths are gonna feast on ‘em.
Who’s in the crowd that fears the Lord, that listens to His servant’s voice, walkin' around in the dark, not seein’ a thing?
Hey y’all, gather 'round that fire you started, wrap yourselves up in those sparks you made. This’ll be your reward from me—you’re gonna lay your heads down feelin’ mighty low.
