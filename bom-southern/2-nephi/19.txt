Well now, let me tell ya, the gloom ain't gonna be near as bad as it was when them folks in Zebulun and Naphtali were gettin’ a raw deal at first, then it just got worse when they were messin’ ‘round the Red Sea over yonder in Galilee with all them nations.
Them that’ve been wandern’ ‘round in the dark, well, they done seen a big ol’ light shinin’; folks livin’ in the shadow of death, that light’s bustin’ through for ‘em.
You done multiplied our people and cranked up the joy—they’re celebratin’ like it’s harvest time, just like when folks are grinnin’ and split up the loot.
You done broke the heavy yoke off folks’ backs and tossed the oppressor’s stick away too.
Every battle a warrior fights is just a noisy mess, clothes all bloodied up; but this one here’s gonna be like burnin’ firewood, I reckon.
For us, a little one is born, a son is given; the whole government’s gonna rest on his shoulders, and they’ll call him Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
There ain't no end to the growth of that government nor the peace it brings, sittin’ on David’s throne, runnin’ things with judgment and justice forevermore. The Lord's fired up about doin’ this.
The Lord sent his word to Jacob, and it’s hit Israel square in the face.
And all the folks, even Ephraim and them livin’ in Samaria, they’re puffin’ up with pride and sayin’ all kinda mess:
Them bricks done fell, but we’re gonna build back up with fancy stones; them sycamores got chopped down, but we’ll swap ‘em for cedars.
So the Lord’s gonna rally up Rezin’s foes against him, bringin’ his enemies together for a good ol’ showdown;
The Syrians in front and Philistines behind; they’re gonna gobble up Israel, just like that. For all this, His anger ain’t cooled off, His hand’s still reachin’ out.
But the folks ain’t turnin’ to the one that’s layin’ the smack down on ‘em, nor are they seekin’ the Lord of Hosts.
So the Lord's gonna cut off head and tail, branch and rush all in one day from Israel.
The ancient fellow is the head, and the prophet peddlin’ lies, he’s the tail.
The leaders of this crowd, they’re leadin' folks astray; and anyone followin’ ‘em’s endin’ up in a world of hurt.
So the Lord ain't gonna take no pleasure in their young'uns, nor show mercy to the orphans and widows; every one of ‘em’s a two-timer and a wrongdoer, and folks are talkin’ nonsense. For all this, His anger’s still not quite lettin’ up.
‘Cause wickedness is burnin’ like a fire; it’s gonna eat up them thorns and briars, catchin’ in them woods, risin’ up like smoke.
By the rage of the Lord of Hosts, the land’s grown dark, and the people are just fuel for that fire; ain't nobody lookin’ out for their brother.
And he’ll grab to the right and still be hungry; eatin’ with the left hand, but ain’t no satisfaction; every man’s gonna be munchin’ on his own arm—
Manasseh and Ephraim, and Ephraim and Manasseh; they’re all gonna be ganging up on Judah. For all this, His anger’s still burnin’, and His hand’s still stretched out.
