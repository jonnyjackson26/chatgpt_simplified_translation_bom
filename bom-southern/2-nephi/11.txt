Well, Jacob done seen his Redeemer—The law of Moses is a preview of Christ comin' 'round, ya hear? Makin' it back in 'bout 559–545 B.C.
Now, Jacob had a heap more to say to my folks at that time; but shoot, I only wrote down what needed writin’, 'cause what I got down suits me just fine.
And now I, Nephi, I'm gonna share more of Isaiah's words, 'cause my heart sure loves every bit of 'em. I’ll make them fit for my people, and send 'em on out to all my young'uns, 'cause he truly saw my Redeemer, just like I done seen Him.
And my brother Jacob, he’s laid his eyes on Him too, same as I did; so I’m passin' their words along to my kids to show 'em my words ain't no fairy tales. By the word of three, God said, I’m gonna make sure my message sticks. But God keeps sendin' more folks to back it up, 'cause He’s gotta prove all He says.
Look here, my heart takes joy in showin' my people the truth about Christ comin'; that's why the law of Moses was handed down; all them things God gave to folks since the world kicked off, they’re all pointin' to Him.
And I’m also happy as a lark in the covenants from the Lord He made with our ancestors; yep, my soul is all about His grace, justice, power, and mercy in the grand ol' plan to save us from kickin' the bucket.
And I find joy in showin' my people that if Christ ain't comin', then we're all stuck in a mess.
'Cause if there ain't no Christ, there ain't no God; and if there ain't no God, well shoot, we wouldn’t even be here, 'cause there couldn’t be no creation. But lemme tell ya, there is a God, and He is Christ, and He’s comin’ when the time is just right.
Now I'm fixin’ to write some of Isaiah's words, so whosoever in my crowd sees 'em can lift their spirits and celebrate for all folks. These here are the words, and y’all can make 'em fit for yourselves and everybody else too.
