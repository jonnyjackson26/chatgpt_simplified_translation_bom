Well now, here’s what I got for ya, rephrased real nice-like:
The weighty message about Babylon that ol’ Isaiah saw comin’ at ya.
Raise up a sign on that high mountain, yell loud for ‘em, wave your hands, so they can strut right into them fancy gates.
I done told my chosen folks, and I called up my strong ones, 'cause I ain't mad at those folks who take pride in my greatness.
You can hear all the ruckus up in them mountains, like a huge crowd hollerin’, a whole mess of nations gettin’ together, the Lord of Hosts is callin’ up the troops for battle.
They’re comin’ from way out yonder, all the way from the end of the sky, yep, the Lord, and His weapons of fury, ready to wreck the whole place.
Hollerin’ time, y’all, 'cause the Lord’s day is comin’ real soon; it’s gonna hit like a tidal wave from the Almighty.
So all them hands are gonna feel weak, and every fella’s heart is gonna turn to mush;
And they’ll be scared silly; pains and sorrows are gonna grab hold of ‘em; they’ll be starin’ at each other in shock; their faces all lit up like flames.
Look out! The day of the Lord is comin’, mean and ready with a big ol’ sledgehammer, gonna make the land a ghost town; He’s gonna wipe out the sinners livin’ there.
The stars up in the sky and all them constellations won’t shine a lick; the sun’s gonna be dark when it rises, and the moon won’t be glowin’ either.
I’m gonna dish out some punishment to the world for all that evil, and the wicked folks for their wrongdoings; I’ll put an end to them proud folks, and knock the haughty off their high horses.
I'm fixin’ to make a man worth more than gold; even a single feller’s worth more than the finest gold nugget.
So I’ll shake the heavens, and the earth’s gonna move outta place, ‘cause of the Lord of Hosts’ wrath, and on the day of His fierce temper.
And it’s gonna be like a scared deer, and like a sheep with no one to look after it; every man’s gonna turn tail to his own folks, and run home.
Every proud soul’s gonna get run through; yep, all them who stick with the wicked will fall by the sword.
Their little ones are gonna be smashed right before their eyes; their homes are gonna be turned upside down, and their wives taken from ‘em.
Just wait, I’m gonna get those Medes riled up against ‘em, and they ain’t gonna care about silver or gold, don’t think they’ll take a shine to any of it.
Their bows are gonna make short work of the young men; they won’t have no pity on the expectin’ women; they ain’t gonna spare a single child.
And Babylon, the pride of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans, is gonna be just like when the Good Lord turned Sodom and Gomorrah to dust.
Ain’t nobody gonna live there, not now or in the future; no way the Arab’s gonna set up camp there, nor the shepherds gonna fold their flocks there.
But the wild critters from the desert will lay low in there; and all them houses gonna be full of sad creatures, and owls gonna make their home there, and funny folks gonna be dancing about.
And the wild beasts from the islands will be callin’ out in their empty homes, and dragons in their fancy places; and Babylon’s time is real close, ain't gonna take long now. 'Cause I’ll wipe her out quick, sure as shootin’; I’ll be merciful to my people, but the wicked are gonna meet their end.
