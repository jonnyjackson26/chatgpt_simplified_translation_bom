Well now, Zion and them young’uns are gonna get themselves saved and cleaned up come that big ol’ millennial day—take a look at Isaiah 4 for what I'm sayin’. 'Bout 559 to 545 B.C., y’know.
And come that day, seven gals are gonna grab onto one feller, sayin’: We’ll cook our own grub and wear our own duds; just let us be known by yer name so we ain't lookin' so bad.
That day, the branch of the Lord's gonna be lookin’ mighty fine and proud; the fruits of the earth gonna be pure and pretty for them folks that made it out of Israel.
And it’s gonna happen that those still kickin' it in Zion and still hangin' around in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone whose name's written down among the livin' in Jerusalem—
When the Lord’s scrubbed off all the muck from them daughters of Zion and cleared out the blood from Jerusalem right in the middle with that spirit of judgment and that spirit of burnin'.
And the Lord's gonna set up a cloud and smoke over every house on Mount Zion and over her gatherin's by day, and a bright flaming fire at night; 'cause every bit of Zion's glory's gonna be a protective shield.
And there’ll be a little shelter to shade ya from the hot sun in the daytime, a safe spot to hunker down from the storms and the rain.
