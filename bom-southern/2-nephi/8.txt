Well, listen up, y’all who’re chasin’ after what’s right. Take a gander at that ol’ rock you came from, and think ‘bout the muck you got pulled outta.
Now think ‘bout Abraham, your daddy, and Sarah, the one who brought you into this world; I called him all by his lonesome and blessed him real good.
The Lord’s gonna wrap His arms ‘round Zion, comfortin’ all them places that got all used up; He’ll turn that wild, barren land into somethin’ sweet like Eden, and that dry old desert just like the Lord’s own garden. Y’all gonna find joy and happiness there, with thankful hearts singin’ sweet tunes.
Hey, listen up, my people; lend me your ears, oh my country folks; a law is comin’ straight from me, and I’m gonna set my judgments shinin’ bright like a light for y’all.
My righteousness is right here, my rescue’s already out the door, and my strong arm’s gonna judge the folks. The islands are gonna be waitin’ on me, trustin’ in my mighty arm.
Lift your eyes up to the skies and take a peek at the ground below; ‘cause the heavens gonna fade away like a puff of smoke, and the earth, well, it’s gonna wear out like an old coat; and those livin’ on it gonna meet the same fate. But my salvation is forever, and my righteousness ain’t goin' nowhere.
Listen up, y’all who know what’s right, the folks in whose hearts I’ve scribbled my laws, don’t be scared of what folks might say, and don’t worry ‘bout their nasty talk.
‘Cause them moths gonna chew ‘em up like a worn-out shirt, and them worms gonna eat ‘em like it’s a wool blanket. But my righteousness is forever, and my salvation gonna last from one generation to the next.
Wake up, wake up! Get your strength back, oh arm of the Lord; rise up like you did back in the good ol’ days. Ain’t you the one that cut down Rahab and put the hurt on that dragon?
Ain't you the one dried up the sea, the waters of that big ol’ deep; you made a path for the ones bein’ rescued to cross over?
So, them folks the Lord freed are gonna come back singin’ to Zion; with everlasting joy and holiness sittin’ pretty on their heads; they gonna find gladness and joy; all that sorrow and sadness gonna run away.
I’m the one; yep, that’s me comforting you. Now tell me, who are you gonna be scared of, a man who’s gonna kick the bucket, or a mere human who’s gonna be turned into grass?
And you forgettin’ the Lord who made you, ‘cause He stretched out the heavens and set the earth up right; but you’re sittin’ there all scared day after day ‘cause of the oppressor’s fury, like he’s about to bring it all down? So where’s that doomsday fury comin’ from?
The captured one’s hightailin’ it, wantin’ to be set free, not lookin’ to die in the pit, nor wantin’ to run outta bread.
But I’m the Lord your God, the one whose waves roar; the Lord of Hosts, that’s my name.
And I’ve put my words in your mouth, and shaded you with my hand, so I could shape the heavens and lay down the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion: Look here, you’re my people.
Wake up, wake up, rise up, oh Jerusalem, who’s been drinkin’ from the Lord’s cup of wrath—you’ve sipped the dregs left at the bottom—
And there ain’t nobody to guide her among all the kids she’s raised; nor a single one takin’ her by the hand, outta all the sons she’s brought up.
These two boys have shown up for you, they gonna feel sorry for you—‘cause of your ruins and wreckage, the hunger and the sword—who’s gonna comfort you now?
Your sons done fainted, ‘cept these two; they sprawled out at the ends of all the streets; like a wild bull caught in a net, they’re filled with the fury of the Lord, the rebuke from your God.
So listen up now, you afflicted ones, drunk but not from no wine:
Thus says your Lord, the Lord and your God is fightin’ for his folks; lookee here, I’ve taken the cup of tremblin’ outta your hand, the dregs of my fury; you ain’t gonna drink it no more.
But I’m gonna hand it over to them folks who’ve been hurtin’ you; them who said to your soul: Get down, so we can walk over—and you laid yourself down like the ground and the street for those who passed by.
Wake up, wake up, get your strength back, oh Zion; put on your finest clothes, oh Jerusalem, the holy city; from now on, there ain't gonna be no more uncircumcised and unclean folks comin’ on in.
Shake off that dust; get up, sit up, oh Jerusalem; break free from the chains ‘round your neck, oh captive daughter of Zion.
