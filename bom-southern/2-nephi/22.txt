In them good ol’ days, all folks’ll be givin’ the Good Lord some praise—He’ll be hangin’ out with us—Just like it says in Isaiah 12. ’Bout 559–545 B.C.
Well now, on that day, you’re gonna say: Hey Lord, I’m gonna sing your praises; even when you were mad at me, you’ve backed off that anger and wrapped me up in comfort.
Looky here, God’s my salvation; I’m gonna trust Him and not be scared; ‘cause the Lord Jehovah’s my strength and my tune; He’s my salvation, too.
So go on and fill up them buckets with joy from the wells of salvation.
And on that day, y’all’ll be shoutin’: Praise the Lord, call on His name, let folks know what He’s been up to, and make sure everybody knows His name’s somethin’ special.
Sing to the Lord, ’cause He’s done some mighty fine stuff; that’s known all over this big ol’ earth.
Yell and holler, you folks livin’ in Zion; ‘cause the Holy One of Israel’s right there in the middle of ya.
