Well, lemme tell ya, the Lord’s vineyard’s fixin’ to be all empty and lonely, and His folks’ll be scattered ‘round—troubles are comin’ down on ‘em while they’s out there lost and alone—But the Lord’s gonna raise up a flag and get His people back together—Now, that’s kinda like what Isaiah was sayin’. ‘Bout 559 to 545 years before Christ, y’all.
And I’m a-gonna sing me a sweet tune for my beloved, all ‘bout his vineyard. My beloved’s got himself a vineyard sittin’ on a mighty fine hill, full of good stuff.
He put up a fence, got rid of them pesky rocks, and planted the best dang grapes he could find. Built a tower right there in the middle and made a wine-press too; he was hopin’ for some nice grapes, but all he got was a bunch of wild ones.
Now listen here, folks of Jerusalem and men from Judah, y’all judge for me between me and my vineyard.
What could’ve been done better to my vineyard that I ain’t already done? So when I looked for some nice grapes, why’d it have to go and give me wild ones instead?
Now y’all come listen; I’m gonna tell ya what I’m gonna do to my vineyard—I’m gonna take away the fence, and it’ll get all eaten up; I’m gonna knock down the wall, and it’ll get trampled down;
And I’ll leave it all wastin’ away; ain't gonna prune it or dig up no weeds; briers and thorns will take over; and I’ll even tell the clouds not to rain on it.
‘Cause the vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the house of Israel, and them folks from Judah, they’re His favorite little plants; He was lookin’ for justice, but all He found was oppression; He wanted righteousness, but all He heard was cries for help.
Well, bless their hearts, woes to them that pile house on top of house, till there ain't no space left, just so they can be sittin’ all by their lonesome in the middle of the earth!
In my ears, the Lord of Hosts said, “For real, lots of houses gonna be all empty, and grand old towns gonna be without a soul.”
Yeah, ten acres of vineyard gonna yield you barely a sip, and a whole mess of seed gonna give you just a little handful.
Woe to them that rise up at the crack of dawn, chasin’ after the strong drink, stayin’ at it till the night’s all gone, and that wine got ‘em all stirred up!
And they got their harps, and fiddles, tambourines and flutes, and wine flowin’ at their parties; but they ain’t payin’ no mind to the work of the Lord, nor considerin’ what He’s done.
So, my people went off to captivity ‘cause they ain’t got no smarts; their good folks are goin’ hungry, and their crowds are dry as bones.
So, hell’s makin’ more room for ‘em, with its mouth wide open; they’ll be headin’ right down along with their glory, crowds, big shows, and all them folks who was having a good time.
And the little man’s gonna be brought down, and the powerful folks gonna be humbled, while them lofty eyes get dropped low.
But the Lord of Hosts, He’s gonna be high and lifted up in judgment, and the holy God, He’s gonna be respected in all His rightness.
Then them lambs will be fed as they should, and them waste spots where the fat ones were will have strangers munchin’ down.
Woe to them that pull iniquity with fancy ropes, and sin like it’s just a ride in a cart;
That say, “Hey, let Him hurry up, speed things along, so we can see it; let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel get here quick, so we can know what's goin’ on.”
Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil, that make darkness seem like light and light into darkness, that turn bitterness into sweetness, and sweetness into bitterness!
Woe to them wise in their own eyes and slick in their own minds!
Woe to them mighty ones drinkin' wine, and them strong fellas mixin' up strong drinks;
Who stand up for the wicked ‘cause it pays, and take away the rights from the good folks!
So, just like fire eatin' up stubble and flames burnin’ up the chaff, they roots gonna rot, and their blooms gonna float away like dust; ‘cause they threw away the law of the Lord of Hosts and turned their backs on the word of the Holy One of Israel.
Therefore, the Lord’s got His anger lit up against His people, He’s stretched out His hand against ‘em and hit ‘em hard; the hills shook, and their bodies laid torn out in the streets. Even with all this, His anger ain’t eased, His hand’s still stretched out.
And He’ll lift up a flag for the nations far away, and He’ll hiss to ‘em from the ends of the earth; and sure enough, they’ll come a-runnin’ quick; ain’t nobody gonna be tired or trippin’ among ‘em.
Nobody gonna be snoozin’ or slumberin’; ain’t nobody gonna loosen their sashes or break their shoelaces;
Their arrows gonna be sharp, their bows all drawn back, and their horses’ hooves gonna be hard like flint, and their wheels gonna spin like a whirlwind, roarin’ like a lion.
They gonna roar like young lions; oh yeah, they gonna roar, grabbin’ up the prey and carryin’ it away safe, and none is gonna get ‘em back.
And on that day, they gonna roar against ‘em like the sea’s roarin’; and if they look out at the land, behold, it gonna be all dark and sad, and the skies gonna be shadowed over.
