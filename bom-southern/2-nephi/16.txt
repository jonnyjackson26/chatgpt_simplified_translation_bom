In the year when King Uzziah kicked the bucket, I also laid my eyes on the Lord sittin' up high on a throne, lookin' all majestic, and His train filled the whole temple.
Up above was them seraphim; each one sportin' six wings; with two, they covered their faces, with two, they covered their feet, and with the last two, they took to the skies.
And one yelled out to another, sayin’: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole dang earth is packed full of His glory.
And the doorposts shook at the sound of the one yellin’, and the whole place filled up with smoke.
Then I said: Whoa, I’m in a real pickle! I’m a mess, ‘cause I got unclean lips, and I’m surrounded by folks who got unclean lips too; I’ve seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
Then one of them seraphim zipped over to me, holdin’ a hot coal in his hand, that he grabbed with some tongs from the altar.
He put that thing on my lips and said: Look here, this has touched your lips; your wrongdoings are all washed away, and your sins are cleaned up.
I also heard the Lord’s voice sayin’: Who’m I gonna send, and who’s gonna go for us? I piped up: Here I am; send me on my way.
And He said: Go and tell these folks—Y’all listenin’, but you ain’t gettin’ it; y’all lookin’, but you can’t see nothin’.
Make these folks’ hearts heavy, and their ears dull, and their eyes shut—'cause if they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and get it in their hearts, they might turn and get healed.
Then I asked: Lord, how long’s this gonna go on? And He said: 'Til the cities are all empty, and the houses are without a soul, and the land’s all messed up.
And the Lord’s gonna move folks far away, ‘cause there's gonna be a whole lot of neglect right in the middle of the land.
But even so, there’ll be a little remnant, and they’ll come back, gonna be like a teil tree, or like an oak that still has strength when its leaves fall off; that holy seed’s gonna hold it all together.
