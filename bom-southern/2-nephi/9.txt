Well now, my dear folks, I’ve been readin’ these here words so ya’ll can understand what the Lord’s promised to all the kin of Israel—  
He’s been talkin’ to them Jews for quite a spell, speakin’ through His holy prophets since way back, keepin’ that message flowin’ from one generation to the next, ‘til it's time for ‘em to find their way back to the true faith and fold of God; when they’ll be brought home to the lands they’re meant to inherit, settlin’ down in all them promised places.  
Look here, my beloved folks, I’m sayin’ this so y’all can be filled with joy and hold your heads high forever, 'cause of the blessings the Lord God’s gonna shower on your young’uns.  
I reckon y’all been ponderin’ a lot of deep questions, many of ya, tryin’ to figure out what’s comin’ next; so I know y’all understand that our bodies gonna wear out and die; but still, with these here fleshly bodies, we'll get to see God.  
Yup, I know y’all get that He’s gonna show Himself to the folks over in Jerusalem, where we hail from; it’s only right that He’d do it among 'em; 'cause it just makes good sense for the great Creator to humble Himself and take on our human form, dyin’ for all of us, so all of us might end up servin' Him.  
Just like death's knocked on everybody's door, to carry out the kind heart of the great Creator, there’s gotta be a resurrection, and it’s gotta come to us folks ‘cause of the fall; and that fall happened ‘cause we strayed; and since man fell, well, we got cut off from bein’ in God’s presence.  
So, ya see, it’s gotta be a limitless atonement—'cause without that, this here corruption couldn’t ever put on incorruption. Folks, it’s plain as day that the first judgment that came about must’ve stuck around forever. Otherwise, this flesh would’ve just rotted and returned to the dirt, never to rise up again.  
Oh, the wisdom of God, His mercy and grace! If our bodies couldn’t rise again, our spirits would be stuck servin’ that fallen angel who turned into the devil, never to get back up.  
And our spirits would be all twisted up like he is, turnin’ into devils, just like him, kept away from our God, sufferin’ alongside that father of lies, in misery just like he is; yes sir, just like that deceiver who tricked our first folks, who even dressed up like an angel of light, stirrin’ up the kids of man to do all kinds of secret evil deeds.  
Oh, ain't our God good, preparin’ a way for us to escape the grip of that terrible monster? Yessir, that monster named death and hell, which I call the death of our bodies, and also the death of our spirits.  
Thanks to our God’s deliverance, the Holy One of Israel, this death I’m talkin’ about—the kinda death that’s just temporary—gotta give back what it took; that death’s just the grave.  
And this death I mentioned, the spiritual one, it too has to give back its dead; that spiritual death is hell; so death and hell gotta cough up what they’ve got, and hell’s gotta turn loose of its captive spirits, and the grave’s gotta let go of its captive bodies, and the bodies and spirits of folks will be brought back together; it’s all through the resurrection power of the Holy One of Israel.  
Oh, how great God’s plan is! On the flip side, God’s paradise gotta give back the spirits of the good folks, and the grave’s gotta give back the bodies of the good folks; and the spirit and the body will come back together again, and everyone will be incorruptible, immortal, and livin’ souls, havin’ perfect knowledge just like we do in the flesh, ‘cept our knowledge will be all perfect.  
So, we’ll know all our wrongs, all our dirtiness, and our nakedness; and those who lived right will know all about their joy and righteousness, all dressed up in purity, even wearin’ a robe of righteousness.  
And it’s gonna happen that when everybody passes from the first death to life, since they’ve become immortal, they gotta stand before the judgment seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then comes the judgment, and they’ll be judged according to God’s holy judgment.  
And you can bet your boots, just like the Lord lives, ‘cause God’s said it, and it’s His eternal word, it ain’t gonna change; those who’ve been righteous will still be righteous, and those who’ve been filthy will still be filthy; so the filthy ones are the devil and his minions; and they’ll be thrown into everlasting fire, a place made just for them; and their torment’s gonna be like a lake of fire and brimstone, burnin’ up forever and ever, with no end in sight.  
Oh the greatness and fairness of our God! He does what He says, ‘cause His words have gone out, and His law’s gotta be followed.  
But hey, those righteous folks, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, who’ve believed in Him, who’ve carried their burdens in this world, and brushed off all the shame—why, they’re gonna inherit God’s kingdom, that was prepared for ‘em since the world began, and their joy’s gonna be full forever.  
Oh the vast mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! He saves His saints from that dreadful monster, the devil, along with death, hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone that brings continuous torment.  
Oh how great the holiness of our God! 'Cause He knows everything, and there ain't nothin’ that He don’t know.  
And He came into this world to save all ya’ll, if y’all will listen to His voice; ‘cause He took on the pains of all folks, yes indeed, the pains of every livin’ thing, men, women, and children, all part of the Adam family.  
And He went through all this just so the resurrection could happen for everyone, so all could stand before Him on that great judgment day.  
And He commands all folks to repent, and to get baptized in His name, havin’ perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or else they ain’t gonna be saved in His kingdom.  
And if they won’t repent, and believe in His name, and get baptized, and hold on till the end, then they gotta face condemnation; ‘cause God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.  
So, He laid down a law; and where there ain’t no law, there ain't no punishment; and if there’s no punishment, then there ain't no condemnation; and where there’s no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy One of Israel got a hold of them, all ‘cause of the atonement; ‘cause they’re freed by His power.  
The atonement makes sure justice gets what it wants from all those who ain't had the law laid down for ‘em, so they’re saved from that terrible monster, death and hell, and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone that brings endless torment; and they’re brought back to that God who gave ‘em breath, the Holy One of Israel.  
But oh, woe to that fella that’s had the law laid down for him, yessir, who’s got all God’s commandments like us, and don’t follow ‘em, thinkin’ he can waste his time here and there; his state is downright awful!  
Oh, that sly plan of the evil one! Oh the emptiness and the foolishness of humans! When they get learned, they start thinkin’ they’re so smart, and they ain’t listenin’ to God’s counsel, pushin’ it aside like they got it all figured out, and that’s why their wisdom is just plain foolishness, and it don’t do 'em no good. And they’ll perish ‘cause of it.  
But bein’ learned ain’t a bad thing if you listen to God’s counsel.  
But oh, woe to those rich folks, rich in all the worldly stuff. Since they got wealth, they look down on the poor, and they pick on the meek, and their hearts are all caught up in their treasures; so their treasure becomes their god. And just watch, their treasure’s gonna fade right away along with ‘em.  
And woe to the deaf ones who refuse to listen; they’re gonna perish.  
Woe to the blind folks who won’t see; they’re gonna perish too.  
Woe to folks whose hearts are unclean, ‘cause they’ll be hit hard with the knowledge of their sins come judgment day.  
Woe to the liar, he’s gonna be kicked down to hell.  
Woe to anyone who just outright kills, for him, death's comin’.  
Woe to the folks who chase after whores, ‘cause they’re gonna get thrown down to hell.  
Yep, woe to those idol worshippers; for that devil of all devils just loves it when they do.  
And, all said and done, woe to those who die in their sins; ‘cause they’re gonna return to God, and see His face, but still be stuck in their sins.  
Oh, my beloved folks, don't forget how awful it is to transgress against that mighty God, and how terrible it is to give in to the temptations of that sly one. Remember, bein’ all about carnal things is death, but bein’ spiritual means you get eternal life.  
Oh, my dear folks, lend me your ears. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Don’t go sayin’ I’ve said hard things ‘bout you; ‘cause if you do, you’ll be fightin’ against the truth; I’m just sayin’ what your Maker’s put on my heart. I get that the truth hits hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous, they don’t fear the truth, they embrace it and stand strong.  
So then, my dear folks, come to the Lord, the Holy One. Remember that His ways are just. The path for man’s narrow, but it’s laid straight ahead of ‘em, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and He don’t hire no help there; and ain’t no other way ‘cept through that gate; ‘cause He can’t be fooled, that’s the Lord God’s name.  
And whoever knocks, He’ll open up for ‘em; and those wise folks, learned folks, and rich folks who strut ‘round like peacocks ‘cause of their smarts and riches—those are the ones He looks down on; and unless they throw all that away, considerin’ themselves foolish before God, and humble themselves right down, He ain’t gonna open up for ‘em.  
But the wise and the prudent things? They’ll stay hid from ‘em forever—yep, that happiness that’s out there for the saints.  
Oh, my beloved folks, don’t forget my words. I’m takin’ off my clothes and shakin’ 'em out in front of ya; I’m prayin’ to the God of my salvation that He sees me with His all-knowing eye; and when judgment day comes, y’all will know that the God of Israel witnessed me shakin’ your sins off my soul, and that I stand bright before Him, rid of your blood.  
Oh, my dear folks, turn away from your sins; shake off the chains of that one who wants to keep you bound; come to that God who is the rock of your salvation.  
Get your souls ready for that glorious day when justice is doled out to the good folks, even the day of judgment, so you won’t be shrinkin’ away in fear; so you don’t remember all your guilt perfectly and feel forced to shout: Holy, holy are Thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty—but I know my guilt; I broke Your law, and my sins are my own; and the devil’s got me, and I’m just prey to his misery.  
But hey, my folks, ain't it right for me to wake y’all up to the heavy truth of all this? Would I really upset your souls if yer hearts were pure? Would I lay it all out plainly if you were free from sin?  
If you were holy, I’d just talk ‘bout holiness; but since you ain’t holy, and you see me as a teacher, I gotta teach y’all the consequences of sin.  
I’ll tell ya, my soul can’t stand sin, and my heart’s all about righteousness; and I’ll give praise to the holy name of my God.  
Come on now, anyone thirsty, come to the waters; and if ya don’t have no money, come on and eat; yeah, come get y’all some wine and milk without a dime to your name.  
So don’t waste your money on stuff that don’t mean a thing, or labor for things that can't satisfy. Listen up good to me, and remember what I’ve said; come to the Holy One of Israel, and feast on what don’t perish or go bad, let your soul find some joy.  
Behold, my beloved folks, remember what your God’s said; pray to Him all the time during the day, and give thanks for His holy name at night. Let your hearts be glad.  
And just look at how great the covenants of the Lord are, and how He humbles Himself to the children of men; and ‘cause of His greatness, grace, and mercy, He promised us our seed won't just be wiped out according to the flesh, but He’ll take care of ‘em; and in future times they’ll grow into a righteous branch of Israel.  
And now, my folks, I wanna keep on talkin’ to ya; but tomorrow, I’m gonna share more of my words. Amen.
