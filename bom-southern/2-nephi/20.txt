Well now, here’s how it goes:
Watch out, y’all, for them folks makin' unfair laws and writin' up all sorts of heavy burdens they done laid out.
They’re tryin’ to keep the needy from gettin’ their fair shake, and takin’ rights from the poor folks, lettin' them widows be easy pickin’s and robbin’ the orphans!
So what in tarnation y’all gonna do when the Lord comes a-callin’, and when all that destruction rolls in from afar? Who you think you gonna run to for help? And where ya gonna stash your pride?
Without me, they’ll be bowin’ down under them prison chains, and fallin’ like the dead ones. Even still, all this mess ain’t makin' the Lord's anger go away, and His hand’s still reachin’ out.
O Assyrian, you’re the stick of my anger, and that staff they’re holdin’ is just their frustration.
I'm gonna send him right into a hypocritical crowd, and give him the go-ahead to scoop up the loot, grab the catch, and stomp 'em down like mud in the streets.
But he don’t mean nothin’ like that, him and his heart ain't thinkin' on that; deep down he’s all about destroyin’ and cuttin' off a whole lotta nations.
‘Cause he’s a-sayin’: Ain’t my princes all kings?
Ain’t Calno like Carchemish? Ain’t Hamath like Arpad? Ain’t Samaria like Damascus?
Just like my hand done built the kingdoms of them idols, and their carved images were better than what’s in Jerusalem and Samaria;
Ain't I gonna do to Jerusalem and her idols just like I did to Samaria and her idols?
So here's the deal: when the Lord’s folded up all His work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I’m gonna whip the pride right outta the king of Assyria, and he’s gonna see his lofty looks come crashin’ down.
He thinks: By the might of my own hand and my own smarts, I done all this here; ‘cause I’m wise; I moved folks around, grabbed their treasures, and pushed them folks down like a brave man.
And my hand done found all the riches of the people like it was a nest; just like someone gatherin' up the leftover eggs, I’ve gathered all that earth up; and ain't nobody flapped a wing, opened their mouth, or made a peep.
Can the ax go braggin’ ‘bout itself to the one who’s usin' it? Can the saw go actin' fancy ‘gainst the one shakinin' it? It’s like the stick tryin' to shake itself ‘gainst them that’s holdin’ it up, or like the staff thinkin' it can lift itself up like it ain’t just a hunk of wood!
So the Lord of Hosts is ‘bout to send some lean times among them well-fed folks; and His glory’s gonna set off a burnin’ like a good ol’ fire.
And the light of Israel gonna be a fire, and His Holy One gonna be a flame, burnin’ right up them thorns and briers in a single day;
And ain't nothin’ left of His glorious forest or fruitful fields, not a soul nor body; they’ll be like when a flag-bearer’s ’bout to drop.
And the rest of them trees in His forest gonna be so few, a kid can just write 'em down.
On that day, the leftover of Israel, and them that got away from the house of Jacob, they ain't gonna lean on the one who hit 'em no more, but they gonna depend on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, for real.
The remnant gonna come back, yep, even the leftovers of Jacob, back to the mighty God.
‘Cause even if your people Israel be as plenty as the sand on the seashore, still, some of ‘em gonna come back; what’s been decreed to happen will overflow with goodness.
For the Lord God of Hosts gonna make it happen, right across the whole land.
So here’s what the Lord God of Hosts says: O my folks livin’ in Zion, don’t you be scared of the Assyrian; he’s gonna swing at ya with a stick, and raise up his staff against ya, just like they did down in Egypt.
‘Cause it won’t be long now, and that anger’s gonna chill out, and my wrath in their takin’ down.
And the Lord of Hosts gonna stir up a whippin’ for him, like the killin’ of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and just like his rod was over the sea, he’s gonna lift it up like they did in Egypt.
And on that day, his load’s gonna be taken off your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; that yoke gonna be shattered ‘cause of the anointin’.
He’s come to Aiath, passed through Migron; at Michmash he done set up his rides.
They crossed over the passage; they made camp at Geba; Ramath's shakin’ in fear; Gibeah of Saul’s high-tailin’ it.
Raise up your voice, O daughter of Gallim; let it reach Laish, O poor Anathoth.
Madmenah’s gettin’ outta here; the folks of Gebim are gatherin' to skedaddle.
He’s still gonna be hangin’ around at Nob that day; he’s gonna wave his hand long the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Look yonder, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts gonna chop off the boughs with a fright; the tall ones gonna get cut down, and them haughty gonna be brought low.
And he’s gonna cut down the thickets of the woods with iron, and mighty one’s gonna bring Lebanon to its knees.
