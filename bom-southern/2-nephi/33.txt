Nephi, he sure speaks the truth—no doubt ‘bout that—He’s givin’ a shout-out to Christ—Folks who got faith in Christ, they’ll be all ears for Nephi’s words, ‘cause they’ll stand tall at that judgment day.
Now look here, I’m Nephi, and I can’t go and spill all the tales my folks been taught; writin’ ain’t my strong suit like jawin’ is; ya see, when a fella speaks with that Holy Spirit’s power, it hits deep in folks’ hearts.
But hold on now, there’s plenty who harden their hearts ‘gainst the Holy Spirit, keepin’ it out; they toss away a whole heap of good stuff that’s been written, treatin’ it like it ain’t worth a hill of beans.
But me, Nephi, I done wrote what I wrote, and I reckon it’s worth a whole lot—especially to my kin. I keep prayin' for ‘em night and day, and my eyes get all leaky ‘cause of ‘em; I call out to my God with faith, knowin’ He hears me.
And I’m sure that the Good Lord will take my prayers and bless my people with ‘em. The words I scribbled down, though I may be shaky in doin’ so, will end up bein’ strong for ‘em; they’ll encourage ‘em to do right; they’ll remind ‘em of their daddies; and they’ll talk ‘bout Jesus, helpin’ ‘em believe in Him and hold on till the end, which is that sweet life forever.
And these words don’t pull no punches ‘gainst sin, plain as day; so, ain’t no soul gonna get riled up ‘bout what I’ve written ‘less they’re dancin’ with the devil.
I take pride in plain talk; I take pride in truth; I take pride in my Jesus, ‘cause He saved my soul from the fiery pit.
I got love for my people, and big ol’ faith in Christ that one day I’ll meet many pure souls at His judgment-seat.
I got love for the Jew—yep, I call ‘em Jews 'cause that’s where I hail from.
I got love for the Gentiles too. But I reckon I can’t expect much for none of ‘em unless they get right with Christ, slip through that narrow gate, walk the straight path leadin’ to life, and keep on truckin’ down that road ‘til the end of their days.
Now listen up, my dear brethren, and hey there, Jew, and every last soul ‘round the globe, lend me yer ears and have faith in Christ; if you ain’t buyin’ what I’m sellin’, then just believe in Christ. And if ya do believe in Christ, you’ll find yerself agreein’ with these words, ‘cause they’re straight from Him, and He handed ‘em to me, teachin’ all folks to do good.
And if these ain’t the words of Christ, you go ahead and judge—‘cause He’ll show you, with power and a whole heap of glory, that these words are His come that final day; and you and I, we’ll stand toe-to-toe at His bar; and you’ll know that I was told by Him to write this, despite my shortcomings.
And I’m prayin’ to the Father in Christ’s name that plenty of us, if not all, can find salvation in His kingdom on that great last day.
And now, my good folks, all y’all from the house of Israel, and ye who roam the ends of the earth, I’m talkin’ to you like a voice shoutin’ from the dust: So long ‘til that great day rolls ‘round.
And you who turn your back on all the goodness of God, and don’t pay mind to the words of the Jews, and my words too, and all that comes from the Lamb of God, well, I’m givin’ you a warm farewell, ‘cause these words will find you guilty on that final day.
‘Cause what I bind here on earth, it’ll be brought up against ya at the judgment bar; that’s how the Lord laid it down for me, and I gotta follow suit. Amen.
