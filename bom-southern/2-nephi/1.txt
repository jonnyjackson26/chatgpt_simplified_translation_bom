Well now, lemme tell ya about this here story. After I, Nephi, finished teachin’ my brothers, our daddy, Lehi, started ramblin’ on ‘bout a heap of things, remindin’ ’em of all the mighty deeds the Lord done pulled off for us when He brought us outta Jerusalem.
He went on ‘bout how we acted up out there on the waters and talked ‘bout all the good grace God showed us, keepin’ us from gettin’ swallowed up by the sea.
Then he chatted ‘bout this land of promise we got, tellin’ us how merciful the Lord was to warn us to hightail it outta Jerusalem.
He said, “Y’all listen here, I had this vision, and let me tell ya, Jerusalem’s a goner; if we’d a stuck around, we’d a gone down with it too.”
But he reminded us, even though times were tough, we snagged ourselves a land of promise, a place that’s better than all the rest; a land the Lord promised me for my kinfolk. Yup, the Lord made sure this land's ours forever, and anyone else that He leads outta other places gets to claim it too.
So, here I am, Lehi, prophesyin’ ‘bout the way the Spirit’s movin’ in me, sayin’ not a soul will enter this land ‘less the Lord brings ‘em here.
In fact, this here land is all set aside for whoever the Lord brings. And if they do right by Him and follow His commandments, this’ll be a land of freedom; they won’t ever be brought low, ‘cept if they go and mess it up. So if wrongdoings pile up, this land’ll be cursed ‘cause of ‘em, but for the righteous, it’ll be blessed forever.
Now, I reckon it’s smart that this land stays under the radar of other nations; ‘cause if too many folks knew ‘bout it, they’d swarm in, and there wouldn’t be no place left for us to claim as our own.
So listen up, I, Lehi, got a promise: if those the Lord drags outta Jerusalem keep His commandments, they’ll thrive on this land; they’ll be kept safe from other nations so they can enjoy it all themselves. If they follow His rules, blessings’ll rain down, and nobody’ll bother ‘em or try to take their inheritance; they’ll live in peace forever.
But I tell ya, when the day comes they start doubtin’ after gettin’ so many blessings from the Lord—knowin’ all ‘bout how the earth and folks got created, seein’ all the wondrous works of the Lord since the very start—having the power to do anything by faith, keepin’ all them commandments since day one, and bein’ shown kindness by His goodness into this fine land of promise—listen here, if they go rejectin’ the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Savior and God, then the fair judgments of a just God are gonna come down on ‘em.
Oh, you bet He’ll send other nations their way, take away their lands, and make ‘em scatter and suffer.
Yep, just as one generation gives way to another, there’s gonna be bloodshed and great troubles among ‘em; so I urge ya, my sons, do remember that; I really want ya to listen to what I’m sayin’.
Oh, if only y’all would wake up; rise up from that deep sleep, shake off them awful chains that got ya bound up, them chains that carry folks right down into eternal misery and despair.
Wake up! Get off that ground, and lend an ear to a worried parent whose time is runnin’ out, ‘cause soon enough my body will be layin’ down in the cold and silent ground where no traveler returns from; just a few more days and I’ll be followin’ the way of all the earth.
But you see, the Lord done saved my soul from hell; I’ve seen His glory, and I’m wrapped up tight in the arms of His love forever.
And I want badly for y’all to remember to keep the laws and rules of the Lord; this has been the worry of my heart since the get-go.
My heart gets heavy with sorrow every now and then, ‘cause I fret that ‘cause of y’all’s stubborn hearts, the Lord your God might unleash His full wrath on ya, cuttin’ you off and destroyin’ you for good;
Or that a curse could befall ya for a pile of generations; you might face swords and hunger, be hated, and be led ‘round by the devil's will and captivity.
Oh my sons, I hope these troubles don’t come your way; I want y’all to be a special and favored people of the Lord. But, whatever happens, let His will be done; His paths are righteous forever.
And He said that: as long as ya keep my commandments, you’ll thrive in the land; but if you don’t, you’ll be cut off from my presence.
Now, I want my heart to be joyful thanks to y’all, and to leave this world with happiness over you, not sorrow weighin’ me down to the grave; rise up from the dust, my boys, and be real men, and get your hearts and minds together, united in all ways, so you can avoid captivity;
So you don’t end up cursed with a bad curse; and so you don’t get on the wrong side of a just God, resulting in the destruction, that’s right, the eternal destruction of both soul and body.
Wake up, my boys; suit up in the armor of righteousness. Shake off those chains binding ya, and come outta that darkness, and rise from the dust.
Quit makin’ trouble for your brother, who’s had glorious visions and kept the commandments since we left Jerusalem; who’s been used by God to get us into this land of promise; ‘cause if it weren’t for him, we’d a-starved out there in the wilderness; still, y’all tried to take his life, and he’s suffered a whole lot ‘cause of your actions.
And I’m downright scared and tremblin’ ‘cause of y’all, wishin’ he ain’t have to go through that again; for y’all have accused him of seekin’ some power over ya; but I know he’s not been after power nor authority over you, no sir, he’s only wanted God’s glory, and what’s best for your eternal souls.
And y’all have grumbled ‘cause he’s been straight with ya. Y’all sayin’ he used sharp words; sayin’ he’s been mad at you; but listen here, his sharp words came from God’s power in him; and what y’all call anger was just the truth from God that he couldn’t hide, speakin’ boldly ‘bout your wrongdoings.
And it gotta be that God’s power is with him, even givin’ him the command to tell y’all to obey. But it wasn’t just him; it was the Spirit of the Lord in him that opened his mouth to speak and couldn’t keep quiet.
And now my son, Laman, and Lemuel and Sam, and my sons who are the sons of Ishmael, listen here, if you’ll listen to Nephi, you won’t perish. And if you listen to him, I’m givin’ ya a blessing, my first blessing.
But if ya won’t listen, I’m takin’ back my first blessing, yep, gonna rest it on him instead.
And now, Zoram, I talk to you: You’re Laban’s servant; yet, you made it outta Jerusalem, and I know you’re a true buddy to my son, Nephi, for good.
So, ‘cause you’ve been loyal, your kin’s gonna be blessed with his kin, livin’ the good life right here on this land; and nothing, unless it’s iniquity among ‘em, will ever mess up their good times here forever.
So if you keep the Lord’s commandments, the Lord’s set this land aside to keep your family safe alongside my son’s family.
