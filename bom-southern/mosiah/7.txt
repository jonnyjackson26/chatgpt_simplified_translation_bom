Well now, it turns out that after King Mosiah had a nice stretch of peace for three whole years, he got mighty curious 'bout what happened to the folks that went up to live in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of it; 'cause his people hadn’t heard a peep from ‘em since they skedaddled from Zarahemla, and they were pestering him somethin’ fierce.
So, King Mosiah decided to let sixteen strong fellas go check in on their kinfolk up in Lehi-Nephi, to see what’s been goin’ on.
Now, the next day, they hit the road, and taggin’ along was one big ol’ Ammon, a strong and hearty soul, and a grandchild of Zarahemla; and he was leadin’ the pack.
Well, they were a bit lost on how exactly to travel through that wilderness to get to Lehi-Nephi; consequently, they wandered about for many days—forty days to be precise.
After wanderin' forty days, they spotted themselves a hill just north of Shilom, and that’s where they decided to set up camp.
Ammon took three of his brothers, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they headed down into the land of Nephi.
Wouldn’t ya know it, they ran smack dab into the king of the folks in Nephi and Shilom; they were just surrounded by the king’s guards, got grabbed up, tied up, and tossed in jail.
After bein’ in the slammer for two whole days, they got called back in front of the king, their ropes were cut, and there they stood, ready to answer whatever questions he had.
He said to ‘em: Look here, I’m Limhi, son of Noah, who was son of Zeniff, who made his way outta Zarahemla to take this land, the land of our folks, and y’all made me king ‘cause the people said so.
Now, I’m wonderin’ why in tarnation y’all thought it was a good idea to waltz up close to the city walls while I was outside with my guards?
Well now, I let y’all live so I could ask ya a few questions, 'cause if I hadn’t, I’da had my guards do away with ya. So, speak up.
And when Ammon figured it was his turn to talk, he stepped up and bowed to the king; then standin’ tall again, he said: O king, I’m just so thankful to God that I’m still breathin’ and gettin’ to chat with ya; I'm gonna do my best to speak right out.
'Cause I’m pretty sure that if y’all had known me, you wouldn’t have let me get all tied up like this. I’m Ammon, a descendent of Zarahemla, and I came up here to check on our kinfolk that Zeniff brought out from that land.
So after Limhi heard what Ammon had to say, he was happier than a lark, and said: Well now, I’m sure my folks from Zarahemla are still kickin’. I’m gonna celebrate, and tomorrow I’ll make sure my people are celebratin’ too.
‘Cause we’re stuck in a mess with those Lamanites, and the taxes they’re layin’ on us are rougher than a cob. Our brothers are gonna rescue us from all this bondage, or we’ll just be slaves; but we reckon bein’ slaves to the Nephites is better than givin’ half to the king of the Lamanites.
And so, King Limhi told his guards to quit cuffin’ Ammon and his brothers, and sent 'em to that hill north of Shilom to fetch their brothers to bring ‘em into the city, so they could eat, drink, and rest after all their hard travels; ‘cause they’ve been through a whole heap, suffered hunger, thirst, and pure exhaustion.
So the next day, King Limhi sent a shout-out to all his people to come together at the temple to hear what he had to say.
And when they all gathered up, he told 'em: O my people, lift your heads and take heart; for the time's near or not far off when we ain’t gonna be under our enemies no more, despite all our struggles that didn’t seem to help; yet I hold onto hope that we still got some fight left in us.
So lift your heads high and rejoice, put your trust in God, the one who was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the same God who brought the children of Israel outta Egypt, made ‘em walk through the Red Sea on dry land, and fed ‘em with manna so they wouldn’t starve in that wilderness; He done a whole mess of things for ‘em.
And let’s not forget, that same God brought our folks outta Jerusalem, and kept ‘em safe and sound ‘til now; but it’s ‘cause of our own sins that we’ve ended up in this mess.
Y’all can witness this day, that Zeniff, who got crowned king over these people, he was just too eager to claim the land of his forefathers, and got tricked by the crafty king Laman, who bargained a deal with him and ended up takin’ a piece of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and Shilom; and the land all around—
And all that was just to make us slaves or bound up. And here we are, givin’ tribute to the king of the Lamanites, forked over half of our corn, barley, and any grain we got, and even half of what our herds and flocks produce; that king’s takin’ half of everything we got or earnin’.
Ain’t that a kick in the pants? And ain’t our troubles just enormous? Just look at how much reason we got to weep.
Shoot, I reckon I’m tellin’ ya, we got plenty of reason to mourn; ‘cause think about how many of our brothers have been cut down, and their blood’s been spilled for nothin’, all ‘cause of sin.
If our folks hadn’t gone and messed up, the Lord wouldn’t have let such a terrible thing come down on 'em. But they didn’t wanna listen to His words; oh no, there was fights breakin’ out among ‘em, even goin’ so far as to shed blood right there.
And they went and killed a prophet of the Lord; yep, a chosen man of God, who called ‘em out on their wrongdoings and prophesied about all kinds of things, even the coming of Christ.
And 'cause he told ‘em that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said He would take on the image of man, just like man was made in the beginning; or to put it another way, he said man was made like God, and that God would come down to earth and take on flesh and blood, and walk among us—
And because he spoke the truth, they went and did him in; and they done a whole lotta other things that brought down God’s wrath on top of ‘em. So who’s surprised they’re in bondage, and sufferin’ somethin’ awful?
‘Cause let me tell ya, the Lord's said: I ain’t gonna help my people when they’re actin’ up; I’m gonna make their paths rocky, so they can’t prosper; and their actions will be a real trip-up for ‘em.
And once more He says: If my people keep sowin’ filthiness, they’ll be takin' a ride on the whirlwind of troubles; and the results will be pure poison.
And again He says: If my folks sow filthiness, they’ll be catchin' the east wind that’s gonna bring quick destruction.
And now, just looky here, the Lord’s promise is comin' true, and y’all are hurtin’ and sufferin’.
But if y’all turn back to the Lord with all your heart and put your trust in Him, servin' Him with everything you got on your mind, if you do that, He’ll, by His own will and delight, bring ya outta bondage.
