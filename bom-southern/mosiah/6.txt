Well now, King Benjamin figured it was high time, after he finished yap-yappin' to the folks, to write down the names of all them who'd made a promise with God to follow His rules.
Yup, there wasn't a single soul in the crowd, 'cept for them little tykes, who hadn't joined that there covenant and taken on the good ol' name of Christ.
And then, when King Benjamin wrapped up all them business matters, he went ahead and set his son Mosiah up as the new boss man and king, givin' him all the lowdown about runnin' the kingdom. Plus, he brought on some priests to teach the folks so they could hear and remember God's commandments, along with the promises they made. After that, he told the crowd to disperse, and they all went on back home to their families.
So, Mosiah stepped in as king right after his daddy. He started reignin' when he hit thirty years old, which meant it had been around four hundred and seventy-six years since Lehi split from Jerusalem.
King Benjamin stuck around for three more years, then he kicked the bucket.
Then it came to pass that King Mosiah followed the good Lord's ways, kept an eye on His laws, and did his best to follow all the commandments.
Mosiah got his folks workin' the land, and he rolled up his sleeves to help out too, so he wouldn't be a burden on 'em. He wanted to do like his daddy did, you see. And for three whole years, there wasn't a single scrap or fuss among his people.
