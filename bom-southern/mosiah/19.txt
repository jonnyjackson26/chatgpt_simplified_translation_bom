Well, it happened that the king's army came back, but they couldn't find no sign of the good folks.
Now, lemme tell ya, the king's forces were lookin’ pretty weak, and folks started pickin’ sides around there.
The smaller group started raisin’ all kinds of fuss against the king, and before long, there was a big ol’ fight brewin’ among ‘em.
There was this fella named Gideon, strong as a bull and none too happy with the king, and he pulled out his sword, swearin’ in his rage he was gonna take that king down.
So he and the king got into it, and when the king saw he was about to get the short end of the stick, he high-tailed it and climbed up on a tower by the temple.
Gideon was right on his heels thinkin’ about taking the king out, but the king looked around and saw them Lamanites comin’ up on ‘em, right on the borders.
In a real whimperin' moment, the king shouted out, beggin’ Gideon to take it easy on him, sayin' the Lamanites were fixin' to wipe ‘em out, and he was worried 'bout his people.
But truth be told, the king was more worried ‘bout his own skin than his folks; still, Gideon let him live.
Then the king ordered everyone to skedaddle before the Lamanites showed up, and he took off leadin’ the charge with all the women and young’uns followin’ him into the wilderness.
Sure enough, the Lamanites were hot on their trail, caught up with ‘em, and started takin' ‘em out.
Next thing you know, the king was tellin’ all the fellas to leave their wives and kids and run from the Lamanites.
But there were plenty who stood their ground, sayin’ they’d rather stick around and face whatever came than abandon their loved ones, while others took off, leavin' their families behind.
Those that stayed put made their pretty daughters step up and plead with the Lamanites to spare ‘em.
And lo and behold, the Lamanites felt a little sorry for ‘em, all mesmerized by the beauty of them gals.
So the Lamanites decided to let ‘em live and took ‘em captive, draggin’ them back to Nephi, makin’ ‘em agree to hand over the king and half of all their stuff, includin’ gold, silver, and all the good things they had, so they would be payin’ tribute to the Lamanite king every year.
Well, one of the king’s boys, Limhi was his name, got caught up with the rest of those prisoners.
Now, Limhi didn’t want his daddy gettin’ himself in a heap of trouble; still, he wasn’t blind to his father’s wicked ways, bein' a decent man himself.
So Gideon sent some men off into the wilderness quietly to look for the king and his crew, and they ran into folks out there, except for the king and his priests.
Those fellas had promised in their heart that they'd head back to Nephi, and if their wives and kids were dead, they’d get some payback and go down fightin’ together.
But the king told 'em not to go back, makin’ ‘em real mad, and they made sure he paid, even to the point of lettin' him meet his end with fire.
And they were fixin' to take out the priests too, but them fellas ran off before they could get caught.
Then they were on their way back to Nephi and bumped right into Gideon’s men. Those fellows filled ‘em in on the whole mess with their wives and kids, and how the Lamanites had allowed them to hold onto their land if they paid ‘em half of all they had.
So, the people let Gideon's men know they’d taken care of the king, and his priests took off deeper into the wilderness to escape.
Once they wrapped up their little ceremony, they went back to Nephi all happy, 'cause their families were safe, and they filled Gideon in on what they did to the king.
And then the Lamanite king made ‘em a promise that his folks wouldn’t touch ‘em.
And Limhi, bein’ the king’s son, got the crown handed to him by the people and promised the Lamanite king his folks would pay tribute, half of all they had.
So, Limhi set to work makin’ the kingdom solid and bringin' some peace to his people.
And the Lamanite king put guards all over the land so Limhi’s folks wouldn’t take off into the wilderness, supportin' his guards from the tribute that came from them Nephites.
For two whole years, King Limhi had himself some good, peaceful times in his kingdom, with the Lamanites leaving ‘em alone and not causin’ any trouble.
