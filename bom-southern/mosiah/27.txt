Well, y’all, let me tell ya what happened next. Folks in the church were bein’ hurt real bad by them folks who just didn’t believe, so they started grumblin’ and complainin’ to their leaders ‘bout it all; and they went and told Alma their troubles. Alma, bein’ the good man he is, took it up with the king, Mosiah. So the king called his priests in for a lil' chat.
Now, King Mosiah decided to send out a big ol’ announcement all over the land sayin’ that no unbeliever was gonna mess with folks who belonged to God’s church.
They laid down some strict rules in all the churches, makin’ sure there was no fussin’ or fightin’, and that everyone was treated equal-like.
No pride or snootiness allowed in the church; every man should treat his neighbor just like he’d want to be treated, workin’ hard to take care of his own self.
Yup, all them priests and teachers needed to be workin’ too for what they got, ‘cept when they were sick or goin’ through some tough times. And you know what? When they did that, they really found favor with God.
Things started settlin’ down, and there was peace rollin’ back into the land; folks were havin’ babies left and right and spreadin’ out all over, buildin’ up cities and towns everywhere you looked.
And the Lord showed up among ‘em, blessin’ ‘em and makin’ ‘em into a mighty and rich people.
Now, the sons of Mosiah, well, they were runnin' with the wrong crowd; they were counted among the unbelievers. One of Alma’s boys, also named Alma, fit in there too, but he turned out to be a real piece of work—wicked as sin and into idol worship. He loved to talk sweet to folks, and that led a lotta good folks astray.
He was like a big ol’ rock in the road for the church, stealin’ folks’ hearts and causin’ all kinds of arguments and mess—just givin’ the enemy a chance to mess with ‘em.
So here’s the deal: while he was out tryin’ to tear down God’s church—sneakin’ around with those sons of Mosiah, lookin’ to lead the good ones wrong, goin’ against God’s rules and the king’s too—
Outta nowhere, while they were kickin’ up trouble, wham! An angel from the Lord showed up, comin’ in like a storm cloud, and he spoke with a voice that shook the ground beneath their feet.
They was so shocked, they just plopped down flat on the ground, not understandin’ a word he said.
But the angel called out again, shoutin’: “Alma, get up and stand tall! Why’re ya messin’ with God’s church? The Lord says: This is my church, and I'm gonna build it up; ain’t nothin' gonna tear it down but if my folks turn against me.”
Then the angel said: “Listen here, the Lord’s heard the prayers of his people and your daddy, Alma, who’s been prayin’ real hard about you, hopin’ you’d find the truth; so I came down to show ya the power of God, ‘cause those prayers need answerin’!”
Then he asked, “Can you argue with God’s power? Don’t my voice shake the whole earth? And can’t you see me right here? I was sent straight from God.”
I’m tellin’ ya now, he went on: “Don’t you forget how your folks were stuck in Helam and Nephi, all chained up, but the Lord delivered ‘em from that mess. Now, I’m tellin’ you, Alma, quit tryin’ to destroy the church, or their prayers won’t be heard, and you might just get tossed aside yourself.”
And that was the last thing the angel said to Alma before he took off.
Well, Alma and his buddies hit the dirt again, just mind-blown; they had seen a real angel, and his voice boomed like thunder, makin’ everything shake. They knew only God’s power could do somethin' that wild.
Alma was so shocked, he couldn't even talk; he got all weak-like and couldn't lift a finger, so his friends had to carry him till they laid him down in front of his dad.
They told his father all that went down, and his daddy was mighty relieved, knowin’ it was God’s power at work.
He called up a whole crowd of folks to witness the wonder the Lord had worked for his son and his friends.
He gathered the priests together, and they all started fastin’ and prayin’ hard, askin’ God to help Alma speak again and get his strength back—wantin’ everybody to open their eyes to God’s goodness and glory.
After two days and nights of that prayin’, Alma got his strength back and stood up, tellin’ ‘em to find comfort.
He said, “I’ve turned my life around, and the Lord has saved me; I’m reborn of the Spirit, y’all!”
Then the Lord told me not to be shocked that all folks, women and children, from every nation and tongue, gotta be born again; they need to be changed from their sinful ways into righteous ones, becomin’ His young’uns.
And that’s how they become brand new; and if they don’t do that, they ain’t gonna inherit the kingdom of God.
I’m tellin’ ya, if it ain’t like that, they’ll get thrown away, and I know this ‘cause I was almost cast off myself.
But after muddlin’ through a heap of troubles and repentin’ like nobody’s business, the Lord in His mercy pulled me outta the flames, and I’m born of God now.
I’ve been saved from the bitter gall and the chains of sin. I was sittin’ in the darkest hole, but now I see the glorious light of God. My soul was tortured eternally, but now I’m saved and feelin’ fine.
I turned my back on my Savior and didn’t believe what our folks had taught us; but now I see He’s gonna come, and He knows every critter He made, and He’ll show Himself to everyone.
Yup, every knee is gonna bow, and every tongue’s gonna confess before Him—even on that final day when every soul stands before Him for judgment. Then folks who lived without Him will have to admit that the punishment is rightly theirs; they’ll be scared and shakin’ in His presence.
And then, just like that, Alma started teachin’ the folks, him and his pals who saw the angel, trappin’ around the land, sharin’ what they witnessed and preachin’ God’s word despite all the troubles they faced, bein’ beat up by nonbelievers all the way.
But through all that mess, they gave a whole lotta comfort to the church, solidifyin’ their faith and encourage ‘em to keep God’s commandments, even through thick and thin.
Four of ‘em were the sons of Mosiah; their names were Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni—those were King Mosiah’s boys.
They hit the road all through Zarahemla, among all the folks under King Mosiah's rule, goin' all out to fix the wrongs they’d done to the church, spillin’ their sins and preachin’ all the wonder they’d seen, explainin’ the prophecies and scriptures to anyone who’d listen.
And that’s how they became instruments in God’s hands, bringin’ a bunch of folks to know the truth and to find their Redeemer.
Ain’t they lucky? They shared peace and good news, declar’n to everyone that the Lord is king.
