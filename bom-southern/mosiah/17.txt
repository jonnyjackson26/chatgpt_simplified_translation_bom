Well, it happened that after Abinadi wrapped up all his talk, the king got real stubborn and told his priests to go ahead and take him outta there and put him to death.
Now there was this one fella named Alma, a kin to Nephi and quite a young whippersnapper, who actually believed what Abinadi had said. He knew all too well the bad stuff Abinadi was callin' out against 'em, so he started beggin' the king to just chill out and let Abinadi leave without all that ruckus.
But that king got even more fired up and had Alma tossed outta the pack, sendin' his henchmen after him to do him in.
Shoot, Alma hightailed it outta there and found himself a nice hidden spot so they couldn't catch him. He was layin' low for quite a spell, just writin' down everything Abinadi had shared.
Then the king had his guards go surround Abinadi and drag him back in; they tied him up and threw him in the slammer.
After a few days, after chatin' with his priests a bit, the king called him back in again.
And the king said: "Abinadi, we got ourselves a charge against ya, and it looks like you’re a goner."
"For you’ve said that God’s fixin' to come down to hang out with folks, and this here is why you’re gonna bite the dust unless you take back everthing you’ve said that ain’t nice about me and my crew."
Now Abinadi didn’t back down, sayin': "I ain’t takin' back a word! Everything I said’s the honest truth, and I’ve landed right in your clutches to prove it."
"Yeah, I’m willin' to take it all the way to the end, and I won’t take back my words; they’re gonna stand as proof against ya. And if you go ahead and kill me, you’ll be spillin' innocent blood, and that’ll stand as your witness in the end times too."
Now that King Noah was gettin' a little twitchy 'cause he didn’t like the idea of what Abinadi was sayin' might come back around on him.
But them priests hollered up against him, startin' to accuse him of talkin' smack about the king. So, the king got all riled up and handed him over to be offed.
Next thing ya know, they grabbed him, tied him up, and started beatin' on him with sticks and such, takin' it all the way to a fatal end.
And when them flames began to lick at him, he hollered at 'em, sayin':
"Look here, just like y’all are doin’ to me, your kin are gonna suffer plenty too—endure the same fiery death ‘cause they trust in the Lord their God."
"And believe me, you’ll be stricken down with all sorts of ailments ‘cause of your wicked ways."
"Yep, you’ll be gettin’ hit from all directions and scattered around just like a wild herd runnin' from mean beasts."
"And on that day, you’ll be hunted down by your enemies and feel the flames just like I do."
So, God’s got a way of settlin' the score with folks who mess with His own. O God, take my soul.
And when Abinadi got to the end of that speech, he fell, meetin' his fiery fate; yep, he was done in ‘cause he wouldn’t back down from God’s commandments, sealing the truth of his words with his life.
