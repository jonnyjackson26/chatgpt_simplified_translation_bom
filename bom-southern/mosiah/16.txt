God saves folks who’ve lost their way—But for them that just live for the flesh, it’s like there ain’t no hope for ‘em—Jesus gives us life after this one, weather it’s eternal bliss or eternal misery. ‘Bout 148 B.C.
Well, after Abinadi finished his piece, he raised his hand and said: There’s gonna come a time when everyone’s gonna see the salvation of the Good Lord; every nation, tribe, tongue, and people gonna be on the same page and confessin’ that God’s judgments are right.
Then all them wicked folks gonna be thrown out, and they’ll be howlin’, cryin’, wailin’, and grindin’ their teeth; and that’s ‘cause they wouldn’t listen to the Lord’s call; so God ain’t gonna save ‘em.
They’re stuck in their wicked ways, and the devil’s got a grip on ‘em; yeah, that old snake who led our first folks astray, that’s what made ‘em fall; that’s what turned all humanity into folks who chase after sins, knowin’ the difference ‘tween right and wrong, givin’ themselves over to devilish ways.
So there we all were, lost; and I tell ya, we’d be downright lost forever if God hadn’t swooped in and saved His people from their mess.
But ya best remember, if a person keeps on livin’, doin’ what their flesh wants, and stays rebellious against God, they’re stuck in their fallen state with the devil holdin’ all the cards. So they’re like there ain’t no hope for ‘em, bein’ an enemy to God; and you betcha the devil is on the same side against Him.
And now if Jesus hadn’t come to earth, speakin’ ‘bout what’s yet to come like it’s already happened, there wouldn’t be no chance for redemption.
And if Jesus hadn’t come back to life, or broke the chains of death so the grave couldn’t win, and death couldn’t sting, there wouldn’t be no resurrection.
But sure enough, there’s a resurrection, so the grave don’t win, and the sting of death’s been gobbled up by Christ.
He’s the light and life for the world; yeah, a light that won’t ever go out; and also a life that goes on forever, so there’s no more death to worry ‘bout.
This here mortal body’s gonna put on immortality, and this here corruptible’ll dress up in incorruption, and stand before God’s judgement, bein’ judged for what they did, good or bad—
If they did good, they’ll get raised up to endless life and joy; and if they did bad, they’ll get raised up to endless misery, servin’ the devil who had ‘em under his thumb, which is pure damnation—
They followed their own nasty desires; never called on the Lord when mercy was just sittin’ there waitin’ for ‘em; ‘cause mercy was reachin’ out to ‘em, but they just ignored it; they were told to turn from their wicked ways but just wouldn’t do it; even though they was told to repent, they turned their back on that too.
And now, don’t y’all think you oughta tremble and get right with your sins, and remember that only through Christ can you be saved?
So, if you’re teachin’ the law of Moses, make sure to also tell ‘em it’s just a shadow of what’s to come—
Tell ’em that redemption’s comin’ through Jesus, the Lord, who’s the one and only Eternal Father. Amen.
