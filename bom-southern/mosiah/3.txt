Alright, here’s what I reckon it sounds like in a Southern drawl:
Well now, listen up, y’all, ‘cause I’ve got somethin’ more to say to ya; I got some words ‘bout what’s comin’ up ahead.
The stuff I’m fixin’ to share came straight from an angel sent by the Good Lord. He told me, “Wake up!” and sure enough, I opened my eyes, and there he was standin’ right in front of me.
He says, “Wake up, and lend an ear to what I’m fixin’ to say; ‘cause I’m here to bring ya some real good news that’s gonna make ya happy.”
The Lord done heard your prayers and saw your good works, and He sent me to let ya know so you can celebrate; and share it with your folks so they can be full of joy too.
Y’all best be payin’ attention, ‘cause not far off, the Lord Almighty who’s been around since forever is comin’ down from the skies to live among folks in a body made of clay, and He’s gonna go ‘round doin’ some mighty works like heal the sick, bring the dead back to life, help folks walk who couldn’t, make the blind see, help the deaf hear, and fix up all sorts of ailments.
He’s gonna cast out them evil spirits livin’ in folks’ hearts.
And y’all, He’s gonna face temptations and all sorts of hurt, hunger, thirst, and tireless labor, more’n any man could handle ‘til he nearly dies; ‘cause blood’s gonna pour from every pore, just from the pain of all the sins and the wrongdoings of His people.
And they’ll call Him Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of everything from day one, and His mama will be named Mary.
And looky there, He’s comin’ for His own, so salvation can reach the children of men who believe in His name; and after all that, folks gonna see Him as just a man, sayin’ He’s got a devil, and they’ll beat Him and hang Him on a cross.
But listen here, on the third day, He’s gonna rise up from the dead; and guess what, He’s standin’ there to judge the world; all these things gotta happen so that there’s fair judgement for all.
‘Cause here’s the deal, His blood covers the sins of those who got lost ‘cause of Adam’s misstep, who died not knowin’ what God wanted from ‘em, or who just sinned outta ignorance.
But oh boy, woe be to the one who knows he’s shakin’ his fist at God! ‘Cause there ain’t no salvation for them unless they turn their lives around and put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
And the Lord God’s gone ahead and sent His holy prophets to every kinda folk, kindred, and tongue, to tell ‘em that if they believe Christ is comin’, they can have their sins wiped clean and be filled with happiness, like He’s already walked among ‘em.
Yet, the Lord God saw his people were stubborn as mules, so He gave ‘em a law, the law of Moses.
He showed ‘em lots of signs, wonders, and shadows about His comin’, and holy prophets spoke about it too; but they just couldn’t take it, harden’ their hearts, and didn’t get that the law of Moses don’t mean a thing ‘til ya get to the atonin’ blood.
And even if little ones could sin, they couldn’t be lost; but I’m tellin’ ya, they’re blessed; ‘cause just like Adam, they fall by nature, but the blood of Christ covers their wrongs.
And let me tell ya this, there ain’t no other name or way for salvation for the kids of men, ‘cept through the name of Christ, the Lord Almighty.
‘Cause listen here, He judges, and His judgement’s fair; and babies don’t perish when they pass away young; but folks bring trouble to their own souls if they don’t humble themselves and be like little children, believin’ that salvation’s been, is, and will be through the blood of Christ, the Lord Almighty.
The natural man’s been in a fight with God ever since Adam fell, and he will be forever unless he lets the Holy Spirit draw him in, puts off that natural man, and becomes a saint through the atonement of Christ, bein’ like a child, gentle, meek, humble, patient, full of love, and ready to accept whatever the Lord sees fit to give him, like a kid listens to their father.
And I’m tellin’ ya, there’ll come a time when everyone’ll know about a Savior across every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.
And when that time rolls ‘round, nobody’s gonna stand blameless before God, ‘cept little children; only through turnin’ their lives around and faith in the name of the Lord God Almighty.
And even right now, when you’ve told your people what the Lord told ya, they still ain’t blameless in God’s eyes, ‘cept as far as the words I’ve shared with ya.
Now, I’ve gone and said what the Lord told me to say.
And the Lord says this: They’ll be like a bright sign against this people on judgement day; and they’ll get judged, every man by what he’s done, whether it’s good or bad.
And if they’ve done wrong, they’ll be stuck face-to-face with their guilt and wrongs, which’ll make 'em wanna hide away from the Lord in a state of misery and endless torment, where they can’t ever come back; so they’ve brought damnation on their own souls.
So they’ve drunk deep from the cup of the wrath of God, which justice can’t turn away from no more than it could say Adam didn’t fall for munchin’ on that forbidden fruit; so mercy can’t claim ‘em no more, ever.
And their torment’s gonna be like a burning lake of fire and brimstone, with flames that can’t be put out, and smoke that’ll rise up forever and ever. That’s what the Lord commanded me. Amen.
