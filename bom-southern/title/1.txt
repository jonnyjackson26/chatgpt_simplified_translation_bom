Well now, this here’s a fetchin' of the tale of ol' Mormon, writ down on them plates snatched from Nephi's own.
So, it’s a cut-down version of what them Nephites and Lamanites been up to—wrote it up for the Lamanites, who still got ties to Israel; also got somethin’ for the Jews and Gentiles too—This here was done 'cause God said so, and also ‘cause He was givin' some prophecies and revelations—Done wrote it all up, sealed it tight, and kept it hid away for the Lord, so it wouldn’t get messed up—It’s gonna come out by God’s big ol' power and help us understand it—Sealed up by Moroni's hand, tucked away for the Lord, so it can show up when the time’s right, thanks to the Gentiles—And we’re lookin' at this whole thing ‘cause of God's grace.
Now, there’s also some abridged bits from the Book of Ether, which holds the records of Jared's folks, who was all scattered when the Good Lord mixed up talkin’ while they were tryin’ to build a big ol' tower to heaven—This here’s to show the remnants of Israel just how great the Lord been for their kin; and so they can remember 'em covenants, that they're not just tossed aside forever—It’s also to help both Jews and Gentiles see that Jesus is the Christ, the Forever God, showin’ Himself to all nations out there—Now, if somethin’ don’t sit right, it’s just the slip-ups of folks; so don’t go puttin’ the blame on the things of God, or you might find yourself in a pickle at the judgment seat of Christ.  
Translated by Joseph Smith, Jun.
