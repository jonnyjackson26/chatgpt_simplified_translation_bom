Israel’s gonna be scattered all 'cross this here earth—The Gentiles are gonna nurse and take care of Israel with the gospel in the latter days—Israel’s gonna get gathered up and saved, and the wicked folks, well, they’re gonna burn up like dried grass—The devil’s kingdom’s gonna get wiped out, and Satan, he’ll be tied up tight. 'Bout 588–570 B.C.
Well, let me tell ya, after I, Nephi, read what was carved on them brass plates, my brothers came up to me askin’, “What in tarnation do them words mean?” They was wonderin’ if it all could be understood in a spiritual kinda way, stuff that’s gonna happen in the spirit, not in the flesh.
And I told 'em, “Look here, it was all shown to the prophet by the Spirit’s voice; ‘cause it’s through the Spirit that the prophets find out what’s gonna happen to folks down here on earth.”
So, the stuff I read’s got to do with both the everyday and the spiritual; looks like the house of Israel's gonna get scattered all over this big ol’ world and into all the nations sooner or later.
Now, I reckon there’s a whole lotta folks already lost from what they oughta know ‘bout Jerusalem. Yep, most of the tribes been led off, scattered to the winds on them islands of the sea; and where they all went, none of us really knows, except we know they’ve been led away.
Now since they’ve been led astray, prophetic words been said about ‘em, and also those who’ll be scattered and confused in the future ‘cause of the Holy One of Israel; they’ll harden their hearts against him, and ‘cause of that, they'll get spread out among the nations and folks are gonna hate ‘em.
Still, after the Gentiles take care of ‘em, and the Lord lifts up his hand towards the Gentiles, makin’ ‘em a standard, and their kids get carried in their arms, and their daughters on their shoulders, well, those words I’m talkin’ about are just for the here and now; ‘cause that’s how the Lord’s covenants work with our ancestors; and it means us in the days comin’ up, and all our kin in the house of Israel too.
And it means that time’s a-comin’ when after all the house of Israel has been scattered and confused, the Lord God’s gonna raise up a strong nation among the Gentiles, right here on this land; and through ‘em, our descendants are gonna get scattered too.
After our folks are scattered, the Lord God’s gonna do some amazing things with the Gentiles, which is gonna be mighty important for our descendants; ‘cause it’ll be like they're bein’ taken care of by the Gentiles, held in their arms and on their shoulders.
And it’s gonna be valuable for the Gentiles too; not just them, but for all the house of Israel, showin’ the covenants of the Father of Heaven to Abraham, when He told him, “In your seed, all the families of the earth are gonna be blessed.”
And I wanna tell ya, my brothers, that all them families out there can’t be blessed unless He shows His power to the nations.
So, the Lord God’s gonna make His arm bare for all the nations to see, bringin' His covenants and gospel to folks in the house of Israel.
He’s gonna gather ‘em back from bein' held captive, and they’ll come together in their own lands; they’ll come outta the shadows and the dark; they’ll know the Lord is their Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.
And the blood from that wicked church, the one that’s a whore to all the earth, is gonna fall back on their own heads; they’ll be fightin’ amongst themselves, and their own swords'll come down on ‘em, and they’ll be drunk on their own blood.
And every nation that wars against ya, O house of Israel, is gonna turn on itself, stumbling right into the trap they set for the Lord’s people. And all who fight against Zion are gonna be wiped out, and that great whore, who messed up the right paths of the Lord, that great and wicked church, is gonna crash into the dirt, and it’s gonna be a mighty fall.
‘Cause look here, the prophet says, the time’s a-comin’ real quick when Satan won’t have no power over the hearts of men no more; 'cause the day’s comin’ soon when all the proud and the wicked are gonna be burned up like dried grass; and that day is gonna come when they gotta face the fire.
‘Cause soon as a whistle, the full wrath of God’s gonna be dumped out on all of mankind; ‘cause He ain’t gonna let the bad folks destroy the good ones.
So, He’s gonna keep the righteous safe by His mighty hand, even if it means His full wrath needs to come, and the good folks are gonna be preserved, even when their enemies are getting burnt up. Don’t you worry, the righteous ain’t gotta fear; the prophet says they’ll be saved, even if it’s by fire.
Now listen up, my brothers, I’m tellin’ ya, these things gotta come real soon; yep, all of it—blood, fire, and smoke's gotta come; and it’s gotta happen right here on this earth; it’s gonna come to people down here in the flesh if they harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
‘Cause the righteous ain’t gonna perish; surely the time’s a-comin’ when all those fightin’ against Zion are gonna be cut off.
And the Lord’s definitely gonna make a way for His folks, fulfillin’ the words of Moses, where he said, “A prophet’s gonna be raised up by the Lord your God, just like me; y’all better listen to everything he says.” And it’s gonna happen that all who don’t listen to that prophet are gonna be cut off from the people.
And now I, Nephi,’m tellin’ ya, that the prophet Moses spoke about is the Holy One of Israel; so he’s gonna bring judgment the right way.
And the good folks don’t need to worry, ‘cause they ain’t gonna be confounded. But it’s the devil’s kingdom that’s buildin’ up among the kids of men, that kingdom that’s settin’ its roots in the flesh—
‘Cause the time's gonna come real fast when all them churches built for profit, and those lookin’ for power over others, and those tryin’ to be popular in the world's eyes, and those chasing after the desires of the flesh and worldly treasures, doin’ all kinds of wrong; yeah, in short, all those belongin’ to the devil’s kingdom are the ones who gotta tremble in fear; they're gonna be brought low in the dirt; they’re the ones who’re gonna be consumed like stubble; and that’s just what the prophet said.
And the time’s comin’ quick when the good folks are gonna be led like young calves, and the Holy One of Israel's gonna reign in power and might and glory.
He gathers His kids from all over the earth; counts His sheep, and they know Him; there’s gonna be one flock with one Shepherd; He’s gonna feed His sheep, and they’re gonna find pasture in Him.
And ‘cause His people are righteous, Satan’s got no power; he can’t be let loose for a good long while; ‘cause he got no hold on the hearts of the people, since they’re livin’ right, and the Holy One of Israel is in charge.
And now look here, I, Nephi,’m sayin’ to ya that all this gotta happen in the flesh.
But, y’all listen, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and folks are gonna feel safe in the Holy One of Israel if they’ll just repent.
And now I, Nephi,’m gonna wrap it up; I wasn’t gonna go on much more about these things.
So, my brothers, think hard on the stuff that’s been written on them brass plates; it’s true, and they testify that a man’s gotta be obedient to God’s commandments.
So don’t go thinkin’ that me and my dad are the only ones who’ve said this or taught it. So if y’all are obedient to the commandments and stick it out to the end, you’ll be saved at the end of the days. And that’s just how it is. Amen.
