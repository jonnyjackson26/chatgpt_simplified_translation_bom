Well, it turned out that I hollered at my brothers, sayin’, “Let’s head back up to Jerusalem, y’all, and keep the Lord’s commandments, ‘cause He’s way tougher than all this here earth. So tell me, why ain’t He stronger than Laban and his fifty fellas, or even all his thousands?”
So let’s go on up; let’s be tough like Moses, ‘cause he sure talked to that Red Sea, and it split like a fence in a windstorm. Our folks made it through all right, on dry ground, while Pharaoh’s armies got themselves drowned in them waters.
Now y’all know this here’s true; and y’all also heard an angel speakin’ to ya, so why in tarnation would y’all doubt? Let’s go on up; the Lord can save us, just like He did our daddies, and take care of Laban, just like He dealt with them Egyptians.
But when I said all this, they were still mad and grumblin’ on, yet they followed me till we got just outside them Jerusalem walls.
And it was nighttime, so I told ‘em to hide outside the walls. After they got themselves hid, I, Nephi, sneaked right into the city and made my way to Laban’s house.
And let me tell ya, I was guided by the Spirit, not knowin’ beforehand what I was ‘bout to do.
But I kept movin’ forward, and when I got close to Laban’s house, I spotted a fella who was flat on the ground, 'cause he had too much wine.
And when I got to him, I realized it was good ol’ Laban.
I laid my eyes on his sword, pulled it right outta its sheath; that hilt was pure gold, and dang, the craftsmanship was somethin’ else. That blade was made of the finest steel around.
So it happened that the Spirit pressed me to take Laban out; but I thought to myself, “Well shoot, I ain't never killed a man before.” I recoiled a bit and wished I could just walk away from slayin’ him.
Then the Spirit told me again, “Listen here, the Lord’s handed him over to ya. And I knew he had tried to take my life, and he wouldn’t listen to the Lord’s commandments, plus he’d taken our stuff.”
Then the Spirit said again, "Take him out, 'cause the Lord's put him in your hands. 
The Lord takes down the wicked to fulfill His good purposes. Better one man take the fall than a whole nation fade away into disbelief.
So when I, Nephi, heard all that, I remembered what the Lord told me out in the wild, sayin’, “As long as your seed keeps my commandments, they'll thrive in the promised land.”
Yep, and I thought, “Ain't no way they can keep the Lord’s commandments under Moses’ law if they don’t have the law itself.”
Plus, I knew that the law was all written down on them brass plates.
And again, I figured the Lord had put Laban right in my path for a reason, so I could grab the records just like He said.
So, I listened to the Spirit, grabbed Laban by the hair, and off came his head with his own sword.
After I done that, I took Laban's clothes and put ‘em on me, every last piece; and I strapped on his armor around my waist.
Once I’d done all that, I headed to Laban’s treasury. As I walked toward there, I saw Laban's servant, who had the keys to the treasury. I told him in Laban’s voice to come with me to the cash box.
He thought I was Laban, since he saw the garments and my sword strapped on me.
He started chattin’ with me about the Jewish elders, knowin’ his master had been out with ‘em at night.
I talked to him like I was Laban.
I also told him I was gonna carry those engravings on the brass plates back to my older brothers waitin’ just outside the walls.
Then I told him to follow me on along.
He thought I was talkin’ ‘bout the church folks, and since I was Laban who had just put the hurt on, he went ahead and followed me.
He kept mentionin’ the Jewish elders as we walked toward my brothers waitin’ outside.
And when Laman saw me, he got so scared he practically jumped outta his skin, and Lemuel and Sam took off runnin’. They thought I was Laban and that he’d killed me, tryin’ to take their lives too.
So I yelled after ‘em, and they finally heard me and stopped runnin’ from me.
Then when Laban’s servant saw my brothers, he started shakin’ all over, ready to bolt back to Jerusalem.
Now, I, Nephi, bein’ a big ol’ fella and havin’ gotten some strength from the Lord, grabbed hold of Laban’s servant and wouldn’t let him run off.
Then I talked to him, tellin’ him, “If you’ll listen to what I say, just as the Lord lives and I do too, if you’ll just listen to our words, we’ll let ya keep your life.”
I told him with an oath that he didn’t need to worry; he’d be free like us if he came down into the wilderness with us.
And I added, “Surely the Lord told us to do this here, so shouldn’t we keep His commandments? If you’ll come down to the wilderness with my father, you’ll have a spot with us.”
Then Zoram got his courage from what I said. Zoram was that servant's name, and he swore he would follow us out into the wilderness. He even promised he’d stick with us from then on.
We were real keen on him stickin’ with us so them Jews wouldn’t catch wind of our getaway into the wild, ‘cause they might come after us and wipe us out.
After Zoram swore to us, our worries about him eased up.
So, we took them brass plates and Laban's servant, and we set off into the wilderness, making our way to our daddy’s tent.
