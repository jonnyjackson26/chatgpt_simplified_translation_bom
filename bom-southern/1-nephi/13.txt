Well, let me tell ya, one day that angel came a-talkin' to me, sayin': "Looky here!" So I gave it a glance and saw a whole mess of nations and kingdoms.
Then the angel asks me, "What're ya seein'?" And I told him, "I see a whole bunch of nations and kingdoms."
And he said, "These here are the nations and kingdoms of them Gentiles."
Next thing ya know, I spotted this big ol' church poppin' up among them Gentiles.
The angel pointed out, sayin': "Check out this church that's downright horrible, worse than any other one, that goes 'round causin' harm to the saints of God, torturin' 'em, and puttin' chains on 'em, heavy as iron, draggin' ‘em into captivity."
I looked closer and saw that big bad church; turns out, the devil founded it.
Then I noticed gold, silver, fancy silks, and scarlet threads, and all kinds of nice clothes; I also saw plenty of ladies of ill repute.
The angel spoke again, sayin': "See all that gold, silver, silk, and fine clothes? That's what this nasty church craves."
And for the world's glory, they done went destroyin' the saints of God, dragging 'em into captivity.
I looked around and saw a whole lotta water, keepin' the Gentiles separated from my kin.
Then the angel told me: "Lift yer eyes, the wrath of God is on your kinfolk."
I saw a fella among the Gentiles, way far away from my family 'cause of all that water; I watched the Spirit of God come down and work on him, and he set out on them waters to reach my kin who were in that promised land.
Before long, I saw the Spirit of God workin' on other Gentiles too; they were makin' their way outta captivity on those waters.
I noticed a heap of Gentiles in the promised land; I also saw God's anger sittin' on my folks, scatterin' 'em before the Gentiles and givin' 'em a good ol' smackin'.
And I saw the Spirit of the Lord with them Gentiles, helpin' ‘em thrive and claim that land for themselves; they looked white and fair as my folks used to be before the trouble started.
I, Nephi, saw that them Gentiles who made it outta captivity humbled themselves before the Lord, and the Lord's power was right there with 'em.
I also saw their mama Gentiles gatherin’ up on the waters and land, gettin’ ready to tussle with ‘em.
I realized God’s power was with them, and His wrath was heavy on those folks comin’ together against ‘em.
I, Nephi, realized that the Gentiles who broke free from captivity were saved by God’s might from all those other nations.
Next thing I knew, I saw that they were doin' well in the land; and I spotted a book bein’ passed around among ‘em.
The angel asked me, “You know what that book's all about?”
I told him, “Nope, not a clue.”
He replied, “Well, it came straight outta the mouth of a Jew.” And I, Nephi, looked again, and he said: "What you're lookin' at is a history of the Jews, chock-full of the Lord's promises to the house of Israel; it also has lots of prophecies from the holy prophets; it's a record kinda like what’s on the brass plates, just not as many; but it surely has the Lord’s promises, and it’s worth a whole lot to the Gentiles."
Then the angel of the Lord said to me: “You saw that book come outta a Jew's mouth; when it did, it had the fullness of the Lord's gospel, the one those twelve apostles are shoutin' about; and they’re tellin’ it like it is, based on the truth found in the Lamb of God."
So, you'd see these things comin' from the Jews, all pure-like, straight to the Gentiles, based on the truth that is in God.
And after the twelve apostles hand it down, you notice that awful church comin' together, which is the worst of all; ‘cause they took away a whole lotta the gospel of the Lamb, messin' with precious pieces, and they’ve also taken many of God’s promises.
All that fuss was to make folks go astray, blindin’ their eyes and hardenin’ their hearts.
So, you see after that book’s traveled through the hands of that nasty church, there’s a heap of simple and precious things taken out, from the Lamb of God’s book.
And once those simple things were gone, it spread across all them Gentile nations; and after it hit all them nations, even over all the waters you spotted with the Gentiles who escaped captivity, you see that because of those missing simple and precious things, folks get all mixed up, even to the point where ol’ Satan wields great power over ‘em.
But you can see that those Gentiles who got outta captivity and got lifted by God above all others are livin’ on a special piece of land, the one God promised your daddy for his kids' inheritance; if not, then God won’t let those Gentiles wipe out all your folks mixed in with ‘em.
And He won’t sit back and let them Gentiles destroy your kin.
That good Lord’s not gonna stand by and let them Gentiles stay in that sorry state of blindness you see on 'em, ’cause of the precious pieces of the gospel of the Lamb that that nasty church kept to itself.
So the Lamb of God says: “I’ll show mercy to the Gentiles, to the remnant of the house of Israel when I judge 'em.”
Then the angel of the Lord talked to me again, sayin’: “Look, the Lamb of God said, after I drop in on the remnant of the house of Israel—I’m talking ‘bout your daddy’s folks—so after I visit ‘em in judgment, and I smack ‘em by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles trip up real bad ‘cause of those simple and precious pieces of the Lamb’s gospel that that nasty church kept hidden, the mother of all harlots will say, that Lamb—I’ll show mercy to the Gentiles that day, bringin’ ‘em a lot of my gospel that’ll be plain and precious, says the Lamb."
‘Cause, listen up, says the Lamb: “I’m gonna reveal myself to your kin so they write a heap of things I’m gonna teach ‘em, which’ll be plain as day; and once your kin get wiped out, and their belief's gone down the drain, even your brethren's seed, just know all this will be tucked away and then brought out for the Gentiles, by my power, the Lamb's gift."
And in those records, my gospel’s gonna be written, says the Lamb, along with my rock and my salvation.
And bless those who strive to bring my Zion to life that day, for they’ll have the gift and the strength of the Holy Ghost; and if they keep going 'til the end, they’ll be lifted up on the last day, saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoever spreads good news, talkin’ about joy, it’ll be beautiful ‘pon the mountains.
Then I saw the remnant of my kin, and also that book of the Lamb of God, which came outta the mouth of the Jew, makin' its way from the Gentiles to the remnant of my family.
And after that book reached ‘em, I noticed some other books comin’ through the power of the Lamb—going from the Gentiles to ‘em, convinvin’ the Gentiles and the remnant of my folks, plus the Jews scattered all over, that the prophets’ records and those twelve apostles of the Lamb are right on the money.
Then the angel said to me: “These last records you seen among the Gentiles gonna confirm the truth of the first ones—the twelve apostles of the Lamb—and will show the plain and precious things that got taken away from ‘em, and will let all folks know, of every kind, tongue, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Everlastin’ Father, the Savior of this world; and everyone’s gotta come to Him, or they ain’t gonna be saved."
And they gotta come followin’ the words that’ll be laid down by the mouth of the Lamb; and them words of the Lamb will be writ down in the records of your kin, just like they’ll be in the records of those twelve apostles of the Lamb; so both gonna come together as one— there’s one God and one Shepherd watchin’ over all the earth.
And the time's comin’ when He’s gonna show Himself to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; and after He’s shown to the Jews and also the Gentiles, then He’ll reveal Himself to both again, and the last shall be first, while the first shall be last.
