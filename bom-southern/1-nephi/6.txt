Nephi's scratchin' down the good stuff 'bout the Lord—his goal's to get folks to come on over to the God o' Abraham and find some salvation. 'Bout 600 to 592 B.C., y'all.
Well now, I, Nephi, ain't gonna spill the beans 'bout my family's history in this here part o' my writin'; I ain't plannin' to do it later neither on these plates I'm choosin' to scribble on; my daddy's kept that record, so I ain't botherin' with it here. 
It’s enough for me to say we’re kin to Joseph.
And honestly, I ain't too keen on gettin' all detailed 'bout my pops’ whole story, 'cause it just won’t fit on these plates; I’m lookin’ for space to write 'bout the things of the Lord.
Truth is, I'm all about tryin' to get folks to come to the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and find their salvation.
So, I ain't gonna scribble down what the world finds all shiny and pretty; I'm just fixin' to write what makes the Lord happy and what speaks to folks who ain't caught up in the world.
So, I’m tellin’ my kin they best not fill these plates up with stuff that don’t matter to the kids of man.
