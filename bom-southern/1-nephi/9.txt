Well, lemme tell ya, Nephi done whipped up two sets o’ records—call ‘em the plates of Nephi, y’all—one set’s got all that everyday kinda history, while the smaller ones get all spiritual and stuff. We’re talkin’ ‘round 600–592 B.C.
Now, my daddy saw a whole heap a’ things, heard ‘em too, and ran his mouth ‘bout it all while he was livin’ in a tent down in the valley o’ Lemuel. And let me tell ya, there was a bunch more things he laid eyes on that ain’t fit to be scribbled down on these here plates.
Now, as I’m talkin’ ‘bout these plates, let me set ya straight—these ain’t the ones where I’m givin’ a full rundown on my folks’ story; nope, those plates I call by my very own name, Nephi—so that’s why they call ‘em the plates of Nephi. And these other plates, well, they go by the same name too.
But I done got a message from the Lord sayin’ I gotta make these plates for a special reason—to make sure there’s a record of my people’s ministry sittin’ right there.
On the other plates, they oughta have a record o’ the kings and all the battles and fussin’ my people has been in; so these plates mainly focus on the ministry, while the other ones are more ‘bout the kings and all that jivin’ and fussin’.
So, the Lord’s told me to make these plates for a smart reason that I reckon I don’t quite understand.
But the Lord, well, He knows everything from the very start; so He’s got a way figured out to get all His work done with His children down here; ‘cause, ya see, He’s got all the power to make sure His words come to pass. And that’s how it is. Amen.
