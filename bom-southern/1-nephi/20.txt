Well now, listen up, folks, here’s the deal, ya hear? O house of Jacob, y’all who go by Israel’s name, y’all comin’ outta them Judah waters, or maybe outta that baptism water, swearin’ by the Lord’s name, but lemme tell ya, y’all ain’t bein’ honest or righteous about it.
Now, they call themselves from the holy city, but they ain’t leanin’ on the Lord of Hosts, the one and only God of Israel; yep, that’s what they call Him.
You best believe I’ve been talkin’ 'bout what’s been goin’ on right from the start; it’s all come straight from my mouth, and I laid it out there for ya. I done showed it to ya quick-like.
I did that ‘cause I knew y’all were hard-headed, with necks like iron and brows like brass, not budgin’ an inch.
From the get-go, I’ve let you in on what was comin’; I showed ya before it happened ‘cause I didn’t want ya sayin’—“My idol made this happen, and my fancy carvings made this go down.”
Y’all seen and heard all this; why ain’t ya spillin’ the beans? I’ve shown ya fresh stuff from now on, some secret things, and you just didn’t know ‘em.
They’re comin’ out now, not from way back; even before you heard ‘em, they was told to ya, so you couldn’t say—“Well, I kinda knew ‘em.”
Yep, and you didn’t hear ‘em; nope, you didn’t know ‘em; from back then, your ears were shut tight; I knew you’d be tricky, called a sinner right from the womb.
But, for my name's sake, I’m holdin’ back my anger, and ‘cause of my glory, I ain’t cuttin’ you off.
Looky here, I’ve cleaned you up, I’ve picked you outta the furnace of hard times.
For my own sake, sure as shootin’, I’m doin’ this, ‘cause I ain’t lettin' nobody mess with my name, nor givin’ my glory to no one else.
Listen up, Jacob, and Israel—my chosen one; yep, that’s me; I was the first, and I’m the last.
My hand laid the groundwork of this ol’ earth, and my right hand’s stretched out the heavens. I call to 'em, and they all stand up together.
Y’all come together, and listen; who among ‘em has said what’s goin’ on? The Lord’s got love for him; sure enough, He’ll do what He promised through ‘em; and He’ll take care of Babylon, and His might will hit the Chaldeans.
The Lord says, “I’m the one speakin’; I’ve called him to shout it out, I brought him along, and he’s gonna make his way smooth as can be.”
Come on over here, I ain’t been whisperin’ in the shadows; from the start, since it was brought up, I’ve been talkin’; the Lord God, along with His Spirit, sent me, y’all.
And here’s what the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, says: I sent him, your Lord who teaches ya how to get ahead, leadin’ you along the path you oughta be walkin’, that’s what He did.
Oh, if only you’d listened to my commandments—your peace would’ve been as steady as a river, and your righteousness like them waves rollin' in from the sea.
Your descendants woulda been like grains of sand; the kids from your loins like little rocks; they wouldn’t been cut off or wiped out before me.
Now get on outta Babylon, run from them Chaldeans, singin’ all the way, tellin’ everyone, shout it all the way to the ends of the earth; say: The Lord has saved His servant Jacob.
And they didn’t thirst; led ‘em through them deserts; made water gush outta the rock; He even split that rock and the waters flowed like crazy.
And even after all that, and then some, there’s still no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked ones.
