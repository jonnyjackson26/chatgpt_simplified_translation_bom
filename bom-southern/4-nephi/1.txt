Well, let me tell ya, the thirty-fourth year rolled on by, then the thirty-fifth came 'round, and lo and behold, those disciples of Jesus got themselves a whole church of Christ settin' up in all the nearby lands. And folks, anyone who come to ‘em and genuinely repented of their mess-ups ended up gettin' baptized in the name of Jesus, and they got themselves the Holy Ghost too.
Then in that thirty-sixth year, every last one o’ them folks got all converted to the Lord all over the land, both Nephites and Lamanites. There wasn’t no fussin' or fighting no more, and each fella treated his neighbor just right.
They shared everything they had, so there weren't no rich folks or poor folks, bond or free; everyone was free, partakin' in that heavenly goodie.
And wouldn’t ya know it, the thirty-seventh year came and went, and still, there was peace all across the land.
Shoot, those disciples of Jesus were doin' some mighty fine works, heal’n up the sick, raisin' the dead, makin’ the lame walk, givin' sight to the blind, and helpin' the deaf hear. They was pullin' off all sorts of miracles among the folks, and not a one of ‘em worked their wonders 'cept in the name of Jesus.
So the thirty-eighth year passed along, then the thirty-ninth, and it just kept on goin’ ‘til the forty-first and forty-second years had slipped right on by, even up to forty-nine years and then fifty-one and fifty-two; shoot, fifty-nine years just zoomed past.
And, lemme tell ya, the Lord was sure blessin’ ‘em plenty in the land; so much so that they were rebuildin' cities that had been burnt to the ground.
Yep, that big ol’ city of Zarahemla got built right back up again.
But doggone it, there were a heap of towns that had sunk into the ground, and water took their place, so them cities couldn't be fixed back up.
Now, look here, them Nephites sure got strong and had a bunch o’ kids, turning into a real fair and happy folks.
They was gettin' married left and right, all blessed up just the way the Lord had promised 'em.
They weren't followin' that ol’ law of Moses anymore, nah; they were stickin' to the commandments that they got from their Lord and God, keepin' up their fasting and prayers, meetin’ together often to pray and listen to the word of the Lord.
Well, I’ll be, there wasn't no bickering among the folks, all across the land; only some powerful miracles bein’ done by them disciples of Jesus.
Now, the seventy-first year passed, then the seventy-second, and on ‘til the seventy-ninth year had come and gone. A hundred years ticked by, and all the disciples of Jesus—’cept for three that was stickin’ around—had gone on to the paradise of God, and other disciples were put in their place; a whole lotta that generation had passed too.
Not a drop of contention was found in the land, thanks to the love of God settlin' in folks’ hearts.
There wasn’t no jealousy, no fights, no ruckus, no shenanigans, no tall tales, no killings, or any kinda wildness; you best believe those folks was the happiest around, 'cause they was made by the hand of God.
There weren’t no thieves nor murderers, no Lamanites, and none of them -ites either; they was just one big ol' family, the children of Christ, and heirs to God’s kingdom.
Boy, how blessed they were! The Lord was showerin' them with blessings in everything they did; they thrived so much it was a hundred and ten years before the first generation from Christ shuffled off, and still, there wasn’t no fussin' in the land.
And it came to pass that Nephi, the fella who kept this last record (on them plates of Nephi), he passed away, and his boy Amos took over for him, keeping it on them plates too.
That Amos held on to it for eighty-four years, and peace still lay over the land, ‘cept for a small bunch of folks that broke away from the church and started callin’ themselves Lamanites; hence, Lamanites popped up in the land again.
Then ol’ Amos kicked the bucket too (countin' one hundred and ninety-four years since Christ hit town), and his son Amos picked up the record in his place; he kept it on them plates of Nephi as well, and it got written down in that book of Nephi, which is this one right here.
Now two hundred years slipped on by, and only a few left from the second generation were still kickin’.
And I, Mormon, just wanna share that folks was multiplyin’ so fast, they spread all over the land, gettin’ themselves pretty darn rich from their good fortune in Christ.
Now, in the two hundred and first year, pride started stirrin’ up among ‘em, with folks wearin' fancy clothes and all sorts of shiny pearls, gettin' real big on the fine stuff of the world.
And after that, they didn’t share their goods no more, not even a little bit.
They started drawin' lines, divvyin’ themselves into classes; and built up churches just for themselves to cash in, all while turnin’ their backs on the true church of Christ.
And wouldn’tcha know it, when two hundred and ten years rolled on past, a whole mess of churches sprang up in the land; shoot, there were lots of churches claiming they knew Christ, yet they denied parts of His gospel so much that they welcomed all kinds of wrongdoings and got all mixed up with the sacred stuff reserved for folks who were worthy.
That church blew up real big ‘cause of all the wrong stuff happenin’, and ‘cause ol’ Satan managed to wrangle their hearts.
And then, there popped up another church that flat out denied Christ, and they took after the true church of Christ, persecutin’ ‘em for bein’ humble and for believing in Christ; they were all riled up 'cause of the many miracles gettin’ done among those disciples.
So, they flexed their power and authority over those disciples of Jesus who stuck with ‘em, throwin’ ‘em in jail; but with the power of the word of God in them, the prisons busted open, and they got out there doin' mighty miracles right among the folks.
But even with all them miracles, the people hardened their hearts, fixin' to kill ‘em just like those Jews in Jerusalem aimed to take out Jesus, just like He said.
They tossed 'em into fiery furnaces, and somehow, they came out without a scratch.
And they heaved 'em into dens of wild beasts, and those disciples played with ‘em like a child plays with a lamb; and they walked right out, no harm done.
Still, folks kept hardenin' their hearts ‘cause they was led astray by a bunch of priests and false prophets buildin' more churches and doin’ all sorts of wrong. They smacked around the people of Jesus; but those folks of Jesus didn’t hit back. And so they dwindled in disbelief and mischief, year after year, 'til two hundred and thirty years ticked by.
Now this year, yeah, the two hundred and thirty-first year, a big ol' divide happened among the folks.
And it came to pass that in this year, a group arose callin’ themselves the Nephites, true believers in Christ they were; and among ‘em, some were known as Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites by them Lamanites.
So the true believers in Christ and the true worshipers of Him (which included them three disciples who was meant to stay) were dubbed Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites.
And it came to pass that those who turned against the gospel got tagged Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they didn’t just drift in disbelief, no, they fought back against the gospel of Christ; they taught their young’uns not to believe, just like their kinfolk did startin’ off.
It was the wickedness of their folks that led ‘em down that path, just like it was from the get-go. They learned to despise God’s children, just like the Lamanites were taught to hate the Nephites ever since the beginning.
And it came to pass two hundred and forty-four years had rolled on by, and there went the ways of the people. The more wicked side of things grew strong, gettin’ way more numerous than the people of God.
And they kept buildin’ up churches just for themselves, deckin’ 'em out with all kinds o’ precious stuff. Two hundred and fifty years passed by, and then two hundred and sixty.
And wouldn’t you know, the wicked part of the people started to rebuild them secret oaths and shady Gadianton combinations again.
And as for the folks callin’ themselves Nephites, they got all puffed up in their hearts over their big ol’ riches, gettin’ vain just like the Lamanites.
From then on, them disciples was filled with sorrow for the world’s sins.
And it came to pass that after three hundred years rolled on by, both the Nephites and Lamanites turned as wicked as each other.
And it came to pass that the Gadianton robbers spread all across the land, and nobody was righteous except for them disciples of Jesus. Gold and silver piled up in heaps, and they were wheelin’ and dealin’ in all sorts of trades.
And then, after three hundred and five years, with folks still stuck in wickedness, Amos took his leave; his brother Ammaron stepped in to keep track of the record.
Once three hundred and twenty years had come and gone, Ammaron, moved by the Holy Ghost, went and hid the sacred records—yep, all those precious records handed down through the years—until three hundred and twenty years since the Lord came.
He hid ‘em up to the Lord, hopin’ they’d make their way back to the remnant of Jacob’s house, just like the prophecies and promises of the Lord said. And that, my friend, is how the record of Ammaron comes to a close.
