In the year when King Uzziah kicked the bucket, I set my eyes on the Lord sittin’ high up on a throne, lookin’ grand, and His robe filled the temple like a ranch hand’s saddle blanket. 
Up top, they had them seraphim angels; each one sported six wings; with two, they covered their mugs, with two more, they hid their feet, and with the last pair, they took to the skies.
And them angels called out to each other, sayin’: Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole wide world is brimmin' with His glory.
And the doorposts shook at the sound of the one callin’, and the whole place was filled with smoke.
Then I said: Oh, shoot! I’m in a heap of trouble; ‘cause I’m a feller with lips all dirty; and I’m livin' among a whole crowd of folks with unclean lips; ‘cause I done seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
Then one of the seraphim zipped over to me, holdin’ a live coal in his hand, which he grabbed with some tongs from off the altar; 
And he plopped it on my lips and said: Look here, this has touched your lips; your wrongdoings are wiped clean, and your sins are scrubbed away.
Then I heard the voice of the Lord askin’: Who’s gonna be my messenger, and who’s fixin’ to ride out for us? I said: I’m here; send me along.
And He said: Ride on out and tell this bunch—They might hear ya, but they ain’t gettin’ it; they might see ya, but they ain’t really perceivin’ nothin’.
Make this crowd’s hearts heavy, and make their ears feel like lead, and shut their eyes—so they don’t see with their eyeballs, hear with their ears, and get it in their hearts, or they might change and be healed.
Then I asked: Lord, how long’s this gonna last? And He replied: Until the towns are all empty, and the homes don’t have a soul, and the land’s left in complete ruin;
And the Lord has pushed folks far away ‘cause there’s gonna be a mighty forsakin’ in the heart of the land.
But there’ll still be a remnant left, and they’ll come back, and they’ll be like an ash tree or an oak tree whose insides stay strong even when they shed their leaves; so the holy seed will be what holds them together.
