The Good Lord’s got a soft spot for Jacob, and He’ll pick Israel again, planting ‘em right back in their own neck of the woods; folks from all over will hitch on to ‘em, and they’ll stick tight to the house of Jacob.
The people will be lassoed and led on home; from all corners of the earth, they'll head back to the lands promised to their kin. The house of Israel will claim ‘em, and the land of the Lord will be home for servants and handmaids, takin’ ‘em captive just like they once were, and they’ll reign over their foes.
Come that day, the Lord will give ya some peace, lettin’ you rest easy from your troubles, fears, and the hard labor you’ve been servin’.
On that day, you’ll be reciting a lil’ saying against the king of Babylon, askin’: “How the mighty tyrant has finally laid low, how the golden city has gone quiet!”
The Lord’s smashed the crook of the wicked and shattered the scepters of the powerful.
Old Satan, who whipped the folks in anger with a relentless hand, who ruled the nations with fury, now finds himself chased down, and ain’t nobody standin' in his way.
The whole wide earth’s at peace, all calm and still; folks are breakin’ into song.
Even the fir trees are singin’ your praises, and the cedars of Lebanon are sayin': “Now that yer outta the way, no lumberjack’s comin’ after us!”
Hell’s stirrin’ below to welcome ya, raisin’ up the dead just for your arrival; it’s called up all the top dogs from the throne, all the kings of the nations.
All them will look at ya and say, “Have you turned into a weakling like us? Are you just like we are now?”
Your grandeur is laid low, buried in the ground; the tunes from your viols ain’t heard no more; the worms are crawlin’ underneath ya, and they cover ya up real good.
How on earth did ya end up flat on your face, O Lucifer, morning star! Ya got cut down to the dirt, which weakened the nations!
For you had it in your heart: “I’m gonna rise up to heaven, I’ll raise my throne above all the glitterin’ stars; I’ll take a seat on the high mountain in the North.”
I’ll rise above the clouds to be like the Almighty.
But you’ll wind up in hell, down in the depths of the pit.
Those who catch a glimpse of you will squint and ponder, saying: “Is this the fella who made the earth shake with fear and rattled kingdoms?”
And turned the world into a barren wasteland, wrecking cities, never lettin’ his prisoners free?
All the kings of the nations, yup, every last one, are layin’ in glory, tucked away in their own homes.
But you’ve been kicked out of your grave like a no-good weed, and the leftover ones who got taken down, slashed through with a sword, are thrown down to the rocks of the pit; they’re like a carcass trampled beneath boots.
You won’t join ‘em in a resting place ‘cause you’ve ruined your land and taken down your people; the seed of wrongdoers won’t ever be remembered.
Get ready to round up a slaughter for his young’uns because of their fathers’ misdeeds, so they don’t rise or claim the land or fill the world full of cities.
‘Cause I’ll rise up against ‘em, says the Lord of Hosts, and snuff out Babylon’s name, leftovers, sons, and grandkids, says the Lord.
I’ll turn it into a haunt for the bittern, and swamps will fill it; I’ll sweep it clear with destruction, says the Lord of Hosts.
The Lord of Hosts has sworn an oath, sayin’: Just as I’ve thought, it’s gonna happen; and as I’ve determined, it shall stand—
I’ll bring the Assyrian into my land and stomp him down on my mountains; then his yoke will come off the backs of my people, and his burden’ll be lifted from their shoulders.
This is the plan set for the whole earth, and this is the hand reachin’ out to all nations.
For the Lord of Hosts has set His sights, and who can change that? His hand's outstretched, and who could turn it back?
In the year king Ahaz took his last breath, this message came.
Don’t you go celebratin’, whole Palestina, ‘cause the stick that’s been whuppin’ ya is shattered; out of that serpent’s root will sprout a dangerous creature, and his bite’ll be nasty as a fire-breathin' serpent.
And the firstborn of the poor will get their fill, and the needy will lay down easy; and I’ll wipe out your root with hunger, and he’ll take down your remnant.
Holler, O gate; wail, O town; you, whole Palestina, are crumblin’ down; for smoke’s rollin’ in from the north, and no one’s gonna stand alone in their time of trouble.
What will they say to the messengers from the nations? That the Lord’s built up Zion, and the poor of His people will find their trust in it.
