Listen up, y’all who’re chasin’ after what’s good and right. Check out the solid rock you’re carved from, and the hole you’ve crawled outta.
Look to Abraham, your old man, and Sarah, that gal who bore ya; I called him all by his lonesome and blessed him good.
The Lord’s gonna wrap His arms ‘round Zion, comfortin’ every lowly spot; He’ll turn her wild land into a paradise like Eden, and her dusty stretches into the Lord’s own garden. You’ll find joy and gladness there, with thanks and sweet songs ringin’ out.
Listen up, my folks; lend me your ears, oh my nation; ‘cause I’m bringin’ a law your way, and my judgment’ll shine bright for the people.
My righteousness is right close, my salvation is comin’ on strong, and I’ll judge the folks with my powerful arm. The islands are waitin’ on me, leanin’ on my might.
Lift your eyes to the sky, and gaze down at the dirt below; the heavens’ll fade away like a puff of smoke, and the earth’ll wear out like an old coat; all them livin’ there will kick the bucket, too. But my salvation’ll last forever, and my righteousness ain’t goin’ nowhere.
Listen close, you who know what’s right, to the folks who carry my law in their hearts, don’t be afraid of what men say, or cower at their insults.
For the moth’ll gobble ‘em up like an old shirt, and the worm’ll munch ‘em down like wool. But my righteousness’ll be here for the long haul, and my salvation’ll keep rollin’ from generation to generation.
Get up, get up! Put on the strength, oh mighty arm of the Lord; wake up just like in the good ol’ days. Ain't you the one who took down Rahab and gave that old dragon a whippin’?
Ain’t you the one who dried up the sea, that mighty deep; who made a path through the ocean so the ransomed could cross over?
So, the redeemed of the Lord are gonna make their way back, singin’ all the way to Zion; and joy and holiness’ll be crowned on their heads; they’ll find gladness and joy, and sorrow and mournin’ will skedaddle.
I’m the one; yes, I’m the one comfortin’ you. Now tell me, who are ya to be scared of folks, who are bound to kick the bucket, or of the son of man, who’s gonna wither like grass?
And forgettin’ the Lord your maker, who spread out the heavens and laid the earth’s foundation, and you keep on gettin' jumpy every day ‘cause of the mighty oppressor, as if he’s lookin’ to wipe you out? And where’s that oppressor's fury, anyway?
The captive’s in a hurry to be free, not wantin’ to perish in the pit, nor see his bread run dry.
But I’m the Lord your God, whose waves roar like thunder; the Lord of Hosts is what they call me.
I’ve put my words right in your mouth and wrapped you in the shadow of my hand, so I can plant the heavens and lay the earth’s foundation, tellin’ Zion: Look here, you’re my people.
Get up, get up, shake off the dust, O Jerusalem, who’s been drinkin’ deep from the Lord’s cup of wrath—you’ve drained the dregs of the cup of shakin’ fear—
And there ain’t no one around to guide her among all the sons she raised; not one out there takin’ her by the hand among the boys she brought up.
These two boys are here for ya, feelin’ sorry for you—what with your ruin and wreckage, and the hunger and the sword—who's gonna comfort you now?
Your boys have fainted, save these two; they’re lying at the streets’ edge; like a wild bull caught in a snare, they’re burnin’ with the Lord's fury, the rebuke from your God.
So, hear me now, you who’re troubled, and tipsy, and not from drink:
Thus saith your Lord, the Lord and your God pleadin’ the case for His folks; look here, I’ve taken the cup of tremblin’ from your hand, the dregs of my wrath; you’re not drinkin’ that again.
But I’ll hand it off to the ones givin’ you a hard time; who’ve said to your soul: “Bow down, so we can step on ya”—and you’ve laid yourself flat like the dirt and the street for them to walk on.
Get up, get up, put on your strength, O Zion; dress up in your pretty clothes, O Jerusalem, the holy city; ‘cause from here on out, there ain’t gonna be no more uncircumcised and unclean comin’ your way.
Shake yourself free from the dust; rise up, sit down, O Jerusalem; shake off the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
