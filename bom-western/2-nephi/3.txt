Joseph in Egypt laid his eyes on the Nephites in a dream—He spoke of Joseph Smith, the seer from our day; of Moses, who’d lead Israel outta trouble; and the coming of the Book of Mormon. 'Bout 588–570 B.C.
Now, listen up, Joseph, my youngest buckaroo. You were born in the wild, in the rough patches of my life; indeed, it was on the saddest days your mama brought you into this world.
And may the Good Lord bless this land for you, it sure is a mighty fine piece of earth, meant for your inheritance and that of your kin with your brothers, for your safety forever, if you keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.
Now, Joseph, my youngest, whom I fetched outta the rough spots of my existence, may the Lord keep you in His favor forever, 'cause your line ain't gonna be wiped out.
See, you're the apple of my eye; I’m a descendant of Joseph, the one who was hauled off into Egypt. Those promises from the Good Lord made to Joseph were mighty significant.
So, Joseph truly caught sight of our times. He got a promise from the Lord that from his line, the Lord God would raise up a righteous branch for the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch that’d get pruned away, yet still remembered in the Lord's promises, that the Messiah would show up for them in the latter days, bringing power, lifting 'em from dark times to the light—yep, outta hidden shadows and bondage to freedom.
Joseph sure testified, sayin': A seer will the Lord my God send, who'll be a special seer for the lineage of my body.
Yup, Joseph said it straight: The Lord spoke to me and said: I’m gonna raise up a fine seer from your line; he’ll be held in high regard among your kin. I’ll command him to take care of a big job for your folks, which’ll be of great value, even bringing 'em to know the promises I made with your ancestors.
And I’ll tell him to do no other work, 'cept for what I command. I’ll make him shine in my eyes; 'cause he’ll be doin’ my business.
He'll be great like Moses, the one I said I’d raise up to lead my people, O house of Israel.
And I’ll raise up Moses, to haul your folks outta the land of Egypt.
But a seer’ll come from your loins; I’ll grant him the strength to bring forth my words to your descendants—and not just words alone, says the Lord, but to convince ‘em of my word, which’ll already be among ‘em.
So, your descendants will write; and Judah’s descendants will write; and what your folks write, along with what Judah’s write,’ll come together to confound false teachings, settle disputes, and bring peace among your kin, and help ‘em remember their forefathers, and the Lord’s promises in these latter days.
Outta weakness, he’ll find strength on the day my work kicks off amongst all my people, to restore you, O house of Israel, says the Lord.
Thus, Joseph prophesied, sayin': Look here, that seer will be blessed by the Lord; and those who try to stamp him out will face failure; 'cause this promise I snagged from the Lord, about my offspring, will come true. You bet I’m certain this promise will come to pass;
And his name’ll be named after me; after his dad's name too. He’ll be just like me; for the things the Lord brings through his hands, by His power, will lead my people to salvation.
Sure enough, Joseph prophesied: I’m holdin’ tight to this truth, just like I'm certain about Moses' promise; for the Lord told me He’d protect your lineage forever.
The Lord also said: I’ll raise up a Moses; I’ll give him some power to carry a rod; and I’ll lay down the law for him in writing. But I ain’t gonna loosen his tongue so he speaks a lot, 'cause I won’t make him a smooth talker. I’ll write him my law, with my own finger; and he’ll have a spokesman.
The Lord said to me too: I’ll raise up from your offspring; and I’ll set a spokesman for him. I’ll make sure he writes down the words for your folks and his spokesman will declare it.
And the words he writes will be just what’s wise for my people, going out to your kin. As if from the dust, your folks cried out; 'cause I know their faith.
They’ll call out from the earth; even calling for repentance to their brethren, even after many generations have passed. And it’ll happen that their cries go forth, real simple like.
'Cause of their faith, their words will come outta my mouth to their kin; and any weakness in their words, I’ll make mighty in their faith, helping ‘em remember my promises I made with their forebearers.
Now behold, my boy Joseph, this kinda prophecy is what my forefathers spoke of.
So, 'cause of this promise, you’re blessed; your kin won't be wiped out, 'cause they’ll listen to the words of the book.
One mighty soul will rise up among ‘em, who’ll do a heap of good, both in word and deed, being an instrument in God’s hands, with great faith, doing mighty wonders and that which is grand in God's sight, bringing about a heap of restoration for the house of Israel, and your kin.
And now, bless your heart, Joseph. You’re little; so listen to the words of your brother, Nephi, and it’ll come to you just like I’ve been sayin'. Hold on tight to the words of your dying dad. Amen.
