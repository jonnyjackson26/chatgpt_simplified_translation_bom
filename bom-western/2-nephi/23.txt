Well now, here's how it goes down, partner:
The heavy load on Babylon, somethin' Isaiah, son of Amoz, laid his eyes on. 
Raise up a flag on that high ol' mountain; holler loud to 'em, wave your hand so they can saunter into the gates of the high rollers. 
I've called on my holy folks, and I’ve rustled up my brave ones too, ‘cause my wrath ain't aimed at them who take joy in my might. 
Listen to the ruckus in them mountains, like a whole heap of folks, a wild uproar of nations fixin' to gather round, the Lord of Hosts is gatherin’ his troops for battle. 
They’re comin’ from a faraway land, from the ends of the earth—yup, it’s the Lord with his fury, ready to clean house. 
Y’all better howl, ‘cause the day of the Lord is a-comin'; it'll hit like a mighty storm from the Almighty. 
So all hands are gonna grow weak, and every man's heart's gonna quiver like a leaf in the wind; 
And they'll be scared outta their boots; anguish and sorrow will grab hold of 'em; they'll stare at each other in shock, their faces brightness red. 
Look out, the day of the Lord's a-comin’, fierce and mighty, gonna make the land barren, and He’ll root out all the sinners. 
The stars up in the sky and all the constellations ain’t gonna shine; the sun will be dark as a coal mine, and the moon won't be throwing light. 
I'll bring the hammer down on this world for its misdeeds, and the wicked for their wrongdoings; I'll put a stop to the arrogance of the proud and level the high folks. 
I’ll make a man more valuable than fine gold, even more than that shiny piece of gold from Ophir. 
So, I'll shake the heavens, and the earth will shake loose from her roots, in the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, and on His fierce day of anger. 
It’ll be like a deer runnin’ for its life, or a sheep no one wants to tend; every man will hightail it back to his own folks, scatterin' off to their own lands. 
Any proud fella’s gonna be cut down; yep, everyone stickin’ with the wicked’s gonna meet the sword. 
Their young'uns will be smashed right in front of 'em; their homes will get looted, and their wives will be taken. 
Now, listen up, I’ll stir up the Medes against ‘em, who won't give a hoot 'bout silver or gold, nor take any shine to it. 
Their bows will break the backs of the young bucks; they won’t feel sorry for a single soul born; their eyes won't show mercy to them young’uns. 
And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms and the beauty of the Chaldeans, will fall just like when the Almighty wiped out Sodom and Gomorrah. 
It'll never be a home again, won’t be lived in from generation to generation; not even the Arab will set camp there, nor the shepherds herd their flocks. 
Only the wild critters of the desert will make their bed there; their houses gonna be full of sorrowful beasts, with owls makin’ their nests and satyrs dancin’ around. 
And the wild beasts of the islands will be callin' out in their deserted homes, and dragons in their fine palaces; their time is 'bout to come, and their day won’t stretch out no longer. I’ll wipe ‘em clean in a hurry; sure, I’ll show mercy to my folks, but the wicked are gonna meet their end.
