Nephi’s words are the gospel truth—They testify about the good Lord—Folks who put their faith in Christ will believe what Nephi says, and his words will stand tall like a witness at the judgment table. 'Round 559–545 B.C.
Now listen here, I, Nephi, ain’t able to jot down all the lessons that were shared among my kinfolk; and I ain’t a mighty scribe like I am a talker; cause when a fella speaks with the Holy Ghost behind him, the Spirit takes that message straight to folks’ hearts.
But I reckon there be many who harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, leavin' no room for it; thus, they throw away a heap of things that are written and treat 'em like they ain't worth a dime.
But I, Nephi, have put down what I have put down, and I reckon it’s mighty valuable, especially for my kin. I keep prayin’ for ‘em daily, and my eyes water my pillow nightly because of ‘em; I call out to my God in faith, and I know he will hear my cries.
And I know the Lord God will bless my prayers for the good of my folks. The words I’ve written, though weak, will be made strong for ‘em; they’ll encourage ‘em to do right; they'll remind ‘em of their fathers; and they’ll speak of Jesus, gettin’ ‘em to believe in him, and to hang in there till the end, which is everlasting life.
And it speaks out strongly against sin, according to the plain truth; hence, no man will take offense at the words I’ve penned unless he’s got the devil’s spirit in him.
I take pride in plain talk; I take pride in truth; I take pride in my Jesus, for he’s pulled my soul from the depths of hell.
I hold a heap of love for my people, and I got strong faith in Christ that I’ll meet many a pure soul at his judgment seat.
I got love for the Jew—I say Jew, ‘cause I mean them folks from where I hail.
I got respect for the Gentiles too. But I tell ya, for none of these can I place my hope unless they get right with Christ, slip through the narrow gate, and walk that straight path leadin’ to life, keeping to it till the end of this earthly journey.
Now, my dear brethren, and also to you Jews, and all you folks at the ends of the earth, listen closely to these words and have faith in Christ; and if you don’t believe these words, then believe in Christ. And if you believe in Christ, you’ll believe in these words, ‘cause they’re the words of Christ, given to me; and they teach all folks to do good.
And if they ain’t the words of Christ, judge for yourselves—for Christ is gonna show ya, with power and great glory, that they are his words on that final day; and you and I will stand face to face before his judgment throne; and you’ll know I’ve been given the command to write these things, despite my shortcomings.
And I pray to the Father in the name of Christ that many of us, if not all, might find salvation in his kingdom on that great and final day.
And now, my dear brethren, all you from the house of Israel, and all you folks from every corner of the earth, I’m speakin’ to you like a voice cryin’ out from the dust: So long until that great day arrives.
And you who choose not to embrace the goodness of God, and disregard the words of the Jews, and my words, and the words that come from the mouth of the Lamb of God, well, I bid you a permanent farewell, for these words will stand as your judgment on that last day.
For what I seal here on earth will come back to haunt you at the judgment table; for that’s what the Lord commanded me, and I gotta stick to it. Amen.
