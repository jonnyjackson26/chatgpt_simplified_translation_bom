Well now, the Big Boss says: Did I toss you aside, or am I just hittin’ the dusty trail without you for good? He's askin’ where’s the paper that says your mama divorced ya? Who’ve I thrown out, or to which of my debtors did I sell ya? Yep, who’ve I sold ya to? Look here, it’s your own misdeeds that done sold yerself, and ‘cause of your wrongdoings your mama’s been put away.
So, when I rode into town, there wasn’t a soul around; when I hollered, you betcha nobody answered. O folks of Israel, is my hand too short to save ya, or do I lack the power to pull ya outta the muck? Just take a gander, at my command I dry up the sea, turn rivers into barren land, and make them fish smell like old boots ‘cause the waters dried up, and critters are dyin’ from thirst.
I cloak the sky in darkness, and I wrap it in rough sackcloth, sure as shootin’.
The Almighty’s given me the gift of gab, so I know just what to say to you folks, O house of Israel. When you’re plum tired, He’s awake at the crack of dawn, givin’ me an ear to listen like a wise ol’ sage.
The Lord Almighty’s opened my ears, and I didn’t fight back or turn tail.
I offered up my back to those who lay down the law, and I let 'em snatch the hair from my cheeks. I didn’t turn away from the shame or the spittin' that came my way.
For the Lord Almighty’s got my back, so I ain't gonna be ashamed. I've set my face as hard as flint and I reckon I won’t be embarrassed.
And the Lord is right here with me, settlin’ my case. Who’s gonna take me on? Let’s step out into the light together. Who’s my rival? Let him draw near, and I'll knock him flat with the strength of my words.
The Almighty's got my back. And all those who try to bring me down, well, they'll wear out like an old coat, and the moths’ll make a meal of 'em.
Who among you respects the Lord, listens to the voice of His servant, and walks through the night without any light?
Look here, all you folks startin’ fires, surroundin’ yourself with sparks, walk on through the glow of your flames and the sparks you've struck. This is what you’ll get from me—y’all will lay down in sorrow.
