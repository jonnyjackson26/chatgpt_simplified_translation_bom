Well now, Jacob set his sights on the Redeemer—The law of Moses sure points to Christ and shows he’s fixin’ to show up. 'Bout 559–545 B.C.
Now, Jacob had a whole heap more to say to my folks back then; but I only jotted down these here bits, ‘cause that’s all I reckon I need.
And now I, Nephi, am puttin' down more of Isaiah’s words, ‘cause my heart just sings when I read 'em. I’m gonna make his sayings suit my people, and I’ll spread ‘em far and wide to all my young’uns, ‘cause he truly saw my Redeemer, just like I done seen him.
And my brother Jacob done seen Him too, just like I have; so I’ll share their words with my kin to show ‘em my words hold water. By the words of three, the Good Lord’s reckonin’ to set my word straight. But God’s all about sendin' more folks to back Him up, and He proves all His words.
Look here, my heart’s set on showin’ my people the truth of Christ’s comin’; that’s the whole point of the law of Moses. Everything God gave to us from the start of this here world is just a shadow of Him.
And my spirit takes joy in the promises the Lord made to our forefathers; yep, my heart rejoices in His grace, justice, power, and mercy in that grand plan of savin’ folks from the clutches of death.
And I find joy in showin’ my people that if Christ don’t come, all men are fixin' to be lost.
‘Cause if there ain’t no Christ, there ain’t no God; and if there ain't no God, we ain't here neither, ‘cause creation wouldn’t have happened. But there sure is a God, and He is Christ, and He’s comin’ at just the right time.
Now I’m settin' down some of Isaiah’s words, so that who-so-ever among my folks sees 'em may raise their spirits and find joy for all mankind. These here are the words, and you can make ‘em fit you and everyone else too.
