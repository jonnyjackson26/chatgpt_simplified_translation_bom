Well now, my dear kinfolk, I done read y’all these here words so you can grasp the promises the Lord made to all the folks of Israel—
He’s been jawin’ to the Jews through his holy messengers right from the start, passin’ down the word generation after generation, ‘til the time comes when they’ll be brought back to the true faith and fold of God; that day when they round up their kin and settle in the lands they’re meant to inherit, claimin’ all them promised places.
Look here, my dear folks, I’m tellin’ ya these things so y’all can be mighty pleased and hold your heads high forevermore, ‘cause of the blessings that the Lord God’s gonna rain upon your young’uns.
Watchin’ you all yearn and search for knowledge about what’s ahead, I reckon you know well enough that our flesh is bound to wither away and meet its end; yet, in our own skins, we’ll lay eyes upon God.
Yup, I reckon you know that He’ll show Himself to the folks over in Jerusalem, where we harken from; ‘cause it’s only right that He’d hang around with ‘em; it glorifies the great Creator that He’d let Himself be like us in the flesh, takin’ on death for every soul, so we might kneel before Him.
Seein’ as death’s touched every single one of us to fulfill the compassionate plan laid down by the great Creator, there’s gotta be a resurrection power, comin’ to us because of the fall into sin; and that fall happened ‘cause of our transgressions; ‘cause man strayed away, he got cut off from the Lord’s presence.
Thus, an infinite atonement must be in play—if it ain’t infinite, this here corruption couldn’t don incorruption. Hence, the first judgment that came on man woulda stuck around forever. If that’s the case, our bodies here would just rot and break down into the earth, never to rise again.
Oh, the wisdom of God, His mercy and grace! ‘Cause if our flesh couldn’t rise again, our spirits would fall prey to that fallen angel, the devil, never to rise again.
Our spirits would turn into that same devil’s kind, and we’d be angels to a devil, banished from the presence of our God, hangin’ out with the father of lies, sufferin’ like him; indeed, we’d be with that scoundrel who tricked our first parents, the one who masquerades as an angel of light, stirring up folks to secret plots of murder and all kinds of shadows.
Oh, how great’s the goodness of our God, who sets a path for our escape from the clutches of that dreadful beast; yessiree, that beast named death and hell, which I reckon is the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.
And thanks to the deliverance our God, the Holy One of Israel, provides, this death I speak of—the temporal one—will let its dead be freed; and this here death, which is the spirit’s end, will also turn its dead loose; so death and hell gotta give back their captives, both spirits and bodies alike, thanks to the resurrection power of the Holy One of Israel.
Oh, what a grand plan our God’s got! On the flip side, paradise must set free the spirits of the righteous, while the grave gives back the body of the righteous; the spirit and body unite once more, and then all folks become incorruptible and livin’ poor souls, holdin’ perfect knowledge just like we do in the flesh, ‘cept our knowledge will be just right.
So, we’ll know the full weight of our guilt and our messiness, and the righteous will know all their good deeds and pure moments, wearin’ the robe of righteousness.
It’ll come to pass that when all folks have passed from this first death to life, bein’ immortal, they gotta stand before the judgment seat of the Holy One of Israel; then comes the judgment, and then they’ll be judged according to God’s holy word.
And I swear, as the Lord liveth, the Lord God has laid this down, and it’s His eternal word, can’t be taken back, that those folks who are righteous will be righteous still, and those who are filthy will stay filthy; thus, those dirty ones are the devil’s and his minions; and they’ll be headed for everlasting fire, meant just for them; their torment’s gonna be like a lake of fire and brimstone, burnin’ up forever without end.
Oh, the greatness and absolute justice of our God! He carries out all He says, and His words have gone from His mouth, and His law’s got to be fulfilled.
But behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, folks who believed in the Holy One, who’ve endured their trials in this world and turned their back on its shame, they’re gonna get the kingdom of God, prepared for ‘em since the world was set up, and their joy’ll be full for all time.
Oh, the vast mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For He rescues his saints from that terrible creature, the devil, and death, and hell, and that endless lake of fire and brimstone.
Oh, how great’s the holiness of our God! He knows all, and ain’t a single thing escapes His sight.
He came into this world to save everyone, if they will only listen to Him; ‘cause He bears the weight of every creature’s pain—men, women, and children—all descendants of Adam.
He takes all this on so resurrection can touch everyone, givin’ ‘em a chance to stand before Him at the big judgment day.
He calls everyone to repent, and be baptized in His name, havin’ perfect faith in the Holy One of Israel, or else they can’t be saved in God’s kingdom.
And if folks ain’t gonna repent and believe in His name, and get baptized, and stick it out till the end, they’re gonna be damned; the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has declared it.
Thus, He lays down a law; and where there ain’t no law, there ain’t no punishment; and where there’s no punishment, there’s no condemnation; and where there’s no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy One of Israel reach for ‘em, thanks to the atonement; ‘cause they’re brought back through His power.
For the atonement meets the demands of justice for all those who didn’t have the law handed to them, rescuin’ ‘em from that dreadful beast, death and hell, and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they’re brought back to that God who breathed life into ‘em, the Holy One of Israel.
But woe be to anyone who’s received the law, yep, got all the commandments of God, just like us, and goes against ‘em, wastin’ their time, ‘cause their state is a dire one!
Oh, that crafty scheme of the wicked one! Oh the emptiness, follies, and foolishness of people! Once they get a bit of smarts, they think they’re wise, and don’t listen to God’s counsel, settin’ it aside, thinking they know better, but their wisdom is just plain foolishness and does ‘em no good at all. And they shall face their end.
But learnin’ ain’t a bad thing if they heed God’s counsel.
But woe to the rich folks, who are mighty in worldly riches. 'Cause they look down on the poor, and they hound the meek, and their hearts are fixated on their treasures; thus, their treasure becomes their god. And just so, their riches shall fade away with ‘em.
And woe to the deaf who won’t listen; they shall meet their end.
Woe to the blind who won’t see; they shall meet their end too.
Woe to those whose hearts ain’t circumcised, ‘cause a look at their sins will strike ‘em at the judgment day.
Woe to the liar, ‘cause he’ll be sent straight down to hell.
Woe to the murderer who kills on purpose, for he’s bound to die.
Woe to them that chase after whores, for they’ll be sent to hell.
Yep, woe to those who worship idols, ‘cause the devil of all devils takes delight in ‘em.
And, long story short, woe to anyone who dies in their sins; they’ll face God, see His face, and still be in their sins.
Oh, my dear folks, remember the gravity of transgressing against that Holy God, and also remember the weight of givin’ in to that sneaky devil. Keep in mind, to set your mind on worldly things is death, and to be spiritually-minded is eternal life.
Oh, my cherished brethren, lend me your ears. Remember the majesty of the Holy One of Israel. Don’t say I’ve been hard on ya; if you do, you’ll be spittin’ against the truth; for I’ve been speakin’ the words of your Maker. I reckon those words ring true against all uncleanness; but the righteous don’t fear ‘em, for they love the truth and remain firm.
So then, my dear ones, come to the Lord, the Holy One. Recall that His paths are just. Behold, the route for man is narrow, but it lies straight ahead of him, and at the gate stands the Holy One of Israel; He don’t employ no servant; and there’s no other way but through that gate; for He can’t be fooled, fer the Lord God is His name.
And for anyone who knocks, He will swing that door wide; and the wise ones, the learned ones, and those rich who puff themselves up with their knowledge and wealth—yep, they’re the folks He looks down on; unless they chuck that pride, humble themselves before God, and get down low, He won’t open up to ‘em.
But the wisdom of the shrewd and learned will stay cloaked from ‘em forever—yep, that happiness that’s laid out for the saints.
Oh, my beloved brethren, remember what I told ya. Look, I’m takin’ off my coat and shakin’ it in front of you; I ask the God of my salvation to see me with His all-knowing eye; so you’ll know at the last day, when everyone’s judged for their deeds, that the God of Israel saw me shake off your sins from my spirit, and I stand bright before Him, having rid myself of your blood stains.
Oh, my dear kinfolk, turn away from your sins; shake off the shackles of that one who’d tie you up tight; come to the God, the rock of your salvation.
Get your souls ready for that glorious day when justice gets served to the righteous, the day of judgment, so you won’t shrink away in fearful dread; that you won’t recall the weight of your guilt perfectly, and be forced to cry out: Holy, holy are your judgments, O Lord God Almighty—but I know my guilt; I’ve broken Your law, and my sins are my own; and the devil's got me, and I’m a prey to his awful pain.
But tell me, my brethren, is it really prudent for me to wake y’all up to this awful reality? Would I stir your souls if your hearts were pure? Would I be plainspoken with you if you were free from sin?
Look, if you were holy, I’d speak of holiness; but since you ain’t holy, and you see me as a teacher, then it’s only right I teach you the outcomes of sin.
Behold, my soul hates sin, and my heart rejoices in righteousness; and I’ll sing praises to the holy name of my God.
Come, my brethren, all who thirst, come to the waters; and if you ain’t got no cash, come buy and feast; yes, come, buy wine and milk without spendin’ a dime.
So don’t waste your coin on what ain’t worth a dime, nor your hard work for things that can’t satisfy. Pay close attention to me, and remember my words; and come to the Holy One of Israel, feasting on what don’t spoil, nor can’t be corrupted, and let your souls feast on richness.
Behold, my dear ones, remember the words of your God; pray to Him day in and day out, and give thanks to His holy name at night. Let your hearts soar with joy.
And reckon just how great the covenants of the Lord are, and how humbly He’s come down for the folks; and ‘cause of His greatness, grace, and mercy, He’s promised us that our descendants won’t be wiped out completely, in the flesh, but that He’ll keep ‘em safe; and in days to come, they’ll sprout up as a righteous branch of Israel’s house.
And now, my brethren, I’d set forth more to you; but I’ll share the rest of my words come the morrow. Amen.
