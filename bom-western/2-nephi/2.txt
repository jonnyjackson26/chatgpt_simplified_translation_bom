Redemption comes through the Holy Messiah—making your own choices is as important as air when it comes to livin' and thrivin'—Adam took a tumble so folks could be—Folks have got the freedom to pick freedom and eternal life.
Well now, Jacob, listen up: You’re my first kiddo during tough times out in the wild. And I’ll be darned, you’ve had your share of heartaches and troubles from the rough n’ tumble of your kin.
But still, Jacob, my firstborn wanderer, you know the mighty ways of the Almighty; He’ll turn your trials into something good.
So, your spirit will be blessed, and you’ll be safe with your brother Nephi, working for your God. I can tell you're saved, thanks to the goodness of your Savior; you’ve seen that when the time’s right, He’s comin' to set folks free.
And you caught a glimpse of His shine when you were young; for that, you’re as blessed as those He’ll help in the flesh; the Spirit ain’t changed a lick, yesterday, today, and forever. And the path was all laid out since the fall of man, and salvation ain’t costin’ a dime.
Folks are taught enough to tell right from wrong. The law’s been handed down to humanity. And by the law, no flesh can claim righteousness; or, by the law, folks are cut off. Yup, the worldly laws cut ‘em off; and the spiritual laws leave ‘em in the dust of misery forevermore.
So, redemption’s tied up in the Holy Messiah; He’s packed full of grace and truth.
Look here, He lays Himself down as a sacrifice for sin, fulfillin’ the law's requirements for all those with a heavy heart and humbled spirit; and it ain’t for nobody else that the law can be fulfilled.
So, how crucial it is to share these truths with the folks out there, so they know no one can hang out in God’s presence ‘cept through the merits, mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who lays down His life for us, then takes it up again by the Spirit’s strength, givin’ life to the dead, bein’ the first to rise.
Thus, He’s the first fruits unto God, as He’ll be intercedin’ for all mankind; and those who put their faith in Him will be saved.
And thanks to His intercession, all folks make their way to God; thus, they’ll stand before Him to be judged based on the truth and holiness found in Him. So the law's ends, given by the Holy One, bring on the punishment that’s set against the happiness that’s also set, to meet the atonement’s ends—
'Cause there’s gotta be a tug-o-war in all things. If it weren’t, my firstborn in the wild, righteousness couldn't wax, nor wickedness, nor holiness nor misery, nor good nor bad. So all things gotta come together as one; if it was one body, it’d stay lifeless, neither alive nor dead, nor rotten nor whole, no happiness nor sadness, nor feelin’ nor numbness.
Thus, it must’ve been made for nothin’; no purpose would’ve been in its creation. This here would’ve dismantled God’s wisdom and eternal plans, plus His strength, mercy, and justice.
And if you say there’s no law, you’d have to say there ain't no sin. If you claim there’s no sin, then you've gotta reckon there’s no righteousness. And if there’s no righteousness, there ain't no happiness. And if there’s no righteousness nor happiness, there can be neither punishment nor misery. And if none of that’s true, then there’s no God. And if there’s no God, we don’t exist, neither does the earth; ‘cause nothing could’ve been created, neither to act nor to be acted on; hence, everything woulda just up and vanished.
And now, my sons, I share these things for your gain and understanding; for there’s a God, and He made all things, from the skies above to the earth below, and everything that’s in ‘em, both things that act and those that get acted upon.
To fulfill His grand design for mankind, once He’d made our first parents, the beasts of the wild, and the birds of the air, and pretty much everything, there had to be a tussle; even the forbidden fruit stands in contrast to the tree of life; one’s as sweet as molasses, the other’s as bitter as a cactus thorn.
So, the Good Lord allowed man to act on his own. Man couldn’t act freely unless he was tempted by one side or the other.
And I, Lehi, based on what I read, gotta reckon that some angel of God, according to the words, fell from the skies; thus, he took on the devil’s role, cravin’ what’s evil in God's eyes.
And since he fell from grace and found himself miserable for good, he aimed to drag down all mankind with him. So he told Eve, oh yes, that old serpent, the devil, who’s the father of lies, he hissed: Go on, taste the forbidden fruit, you won’t kick the bucket, but you’ll be like God, knowin’ right from wrong.
And after Adam and Eve took a bite of the forbidden fruit, they were sent packin' from the garden of Eden, to work the land.
And they started raisin’ young’uns; yep, even the whole clan on earth.
And the days for the children of men got stretched out ‘cause God’s will was for them to have a shot at repentin’ while still livin'; thus, their situation turned into a probation period, with time extended, according to the commandments the Lord gave to His kids. He commanded that all must repent; for He made it clear to all that they were lost ‘cause of their folks’ misdeeds.
And now, look here, if Adam hadn’t stepped out of line, he wouldn’t have faced a fall but would’ve stayed put in the garden of Eden. And all things made would’ve stayed just as they were and had no end.
And there wouldn’t have been no children; so they would’ve stayed innocent, knowin’ no joy ‘cause they didn’t know sad; doin’ no good ‘cause they didn’t know sin.
But lo and behold, all things have gone down in the wisdom of the One who knows it all.
Adam took a spill so mankind could stand; and folks are here so they can have joy.
And the Messiah shows up right on schedule, to save folks from the mess of the fall. ‘Cause they’re saved from the spill, they’re free for good, knowing right from wrong; they can act for themselves and not just be acted upon, except when it’s the law’s punishment on that great last day, according to what God’s commanded.
So, men are indeed free in the flesh; and they’ve been given what they need to get by. They can choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator for all, or they can pick bondage and death, based on the devil’s snares; ‘cause he’s lookin’ to make all men as miserable as he is.
And now, my sons, I implore you to look to the great Mediator, listen to his mighty commandments; stay true to his words, and pick eternal life, following the will of His Holy Spirit;
And steer clear of eternal death, followin’ fleshly desires and the evil they carry, which gives the devil strength to ensnare you, dragg’n you down to hell, so he can rule over you in his own domain.
I’ve shared these few words with y’all, my sons, in the twilight of my probation; and I’ve picked the good path, just like the prophet said. I’ve got no other aim but your eternal well-being. Amen.
