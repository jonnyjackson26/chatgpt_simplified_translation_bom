In the last stretch, darkness and backslidin’ are gonna blanket the earth—The Book of Mormon's gonna show its face—Three fellas will stand up to vouch for the book—The fancy-talkin’ folks will scratch their heads, claimin’ they can’t make heads or tails of the sealed book—The Lord’s fixin’ to pull off a mighty fine spectacle—Same as Isaiah said. ’Bout 559–545 B.C.
Now listen here, in the end times, or when the Gentiles are runnin’ wild—yep, all the nations of the Gentiles and the Jews, whether they set foot on this land or roam around elsewhere, over all the earth’s patch—yep, they’ll be bumfuzzled with sin and all kinds of wickedness—
When that day rolls in, they’ll get a visit from the Lord of Hosts, accompanied by thunder, earthquakes, loud ruckus, storms, tempests, and flames that’ll roast ya.
And all them nations fightin’ against Zion, givin’ her grief, will be like a dream from a restless night; like a hungry feller dreamin’ he’s feasting, but when he wakes up, his belly’s empty; or like a thirsty cowboy who dreams he’s drinkin’, but upon waking, he’s parched and achey; that’s how the whole lot of folks opposed to Mount Zion will feel.
Y’all listen close, all ya doin’ wrong, stand in awe, ‘cause you’re gonna holler out, shout loud; yep, you’ll be drunk, but not off whiskey, you’ll be staggerin’, but not from strong drink.
See, the Lord’s poured a deep sleep over ya. You’ve shut your eyes and turned your backs on the prophets; and he’s hid the rulers and seers ‘cause of your sins.
One day, the Lord God’s gonna bring you words from a book, and they’ll be words from those who’ve been snoozin’.
And check it out, the book’s gonna be sealed up tight; inside it’s got a revelation from God, from when the world started till it winds down.
So, ‘cause the sealed stuff, it won’t be handed out in the days of folks actin’ wicked and foul. So, that book's gonna be kept away from them.
But there’s gonna be a man who gets that book, and he’ll share its words, the words from those who’re buried in the dust, and pass ‘em along to another;
Yet, the sealed words he ain’t gonna pass on, nor’ll he hand over the book. That book will be sealed by the power of God, and the revelation that’s locked up will stay under wraps until the right time for the Lord, so it can come out; ‘cause it tells everything from the ground up all the way to the end.
And the day’s comin’ when the book’s sealed words will be read out loud atop the rooftops; they’ll come to light through the power of Christ; everything’ll be shared with mankind who’s ever been and ever will be, ‘til the end of the earth.
So, on that day when the book is handed to the man I told ya about, it’ll be hidden from the world’s eyes, and no one will see it unless three witnesses, by the power of God, see it alongside the fella who’s getting the book; and they’ll testify to the truth of it and the treasures inside.
None else will get to lay eyes on it, ‘cept for a few folks, according to God’s will, to bear witness of His word to mankind; for the Lord God’s made it clear that the faithful’s words will sound as if from the beyond.
So, the Lord God’s gonna get the book’s words out in the open; and with however many witnesses seems right, He’ll make His word stick; and woe be to the one who casts aside God’s word!
Now, the time’ll come when the Lord God tells the one He hands the book to: Take these unsealed words and share ‘em with another, sayin’: Read this here, if ya would. And the learned will reply: Bring me the book, and I’ll give it a read.
Now, ‘cause the world’s glory and the lust for gain, they’ll spout this, not givin’ a hoot for God’s glory.
And the man will say: I can’t fetch the book, ‘cause it’s sealed up.
Then the learned ones will say: I can’t read it.
So it’ll pan out that the Lord God will hand back that book and its words to the fella who ain’t schooled; and he’ll say: I ain’t learned at all.
Then the Lord God will tell him: The learned ain’t gonna read ‘em, ‘cause they’ve turned their backs, and I can do my own work; so you’ll read the words I give you.
Don’t mess with the sealed things, ‘cause I’ll bring ‘em forth when it’s time; I’m gonna show the folks that I can do my own work.
So, when you’ve read the words I told ya to read, and found the witnesses I promised ya, then you’ll seal that book up again and stash it away for me, so I can keep the words you haven’t read until I decide to reveal ‘em to mankind, in my own time and wisdom.
For you see, I am God; a God of miracles; I’ll make known to the world that I’m the same yesterday, today, and forever; I don’t work among people unless it’s according to their faith.
And again, it’ll come to pass that the Lord will speak to the one reading the words handed to him:
Because this people gets close to me with their lips but their hearts are a far cry from me, and they learn to fear me by what men say—
So, I’ll set about doin’ a mighty wonderous thing among this crowd, a wondrous work, for the wisdom of the wise will vanish, and the understanding of the proud will be hid away.
And woe to those tryin’ to keep their plans hidden from the Lord! Their deeds are slick as shadows; they’ll wonder: Who sees us? And who knows us? And they think: Surely, turnin’ things inside out’s what the potter does. But behold, I’ll show ‘em, says the Lord of Hosts, I know all their deeds. Can the thing made say to its maker, you didn’t make me? Or can the framed thing say to its framer, you ain’t got a clue?
But listen here, says the Lord of Hosts: I’ll show the folks that it won’t be long ‘fore Lebanon turns into a fruitful spread; and the fruitful field will be like a grand old forest.
And on that day, the deaf will hear the book’s words, and the blind will see outta the shadows and the gloom.
And the meek will grow stronger, full of joy in the Lord, and the poor among men will shout for joy in the Holy One of Israel.
For as sure as the Lord lives, they’ll see that the mighty ones are brought low, the mockers are consumed, and all who look for wrongdoing will be cut off;
And those who make a fella feel like a criminal for sayin’ a word, and set traps for the one who speaks truth at the gates, and twist things to wrong the just for a mere trinket.
So, thus says the Lord, who saved Abraham, about the house of Jacob: Jacob won’t hang his head in shame anymore, nor will he turn pale.
But when he sees his kin, the work of my hands, in his midst, they’ll hallow my name, and give respect to the Holy One of Jacob, and fear the God of Israel.
And those who went astray in spirit will come to wisdom, and those who grumbled will learn the right way.
