Zion and her gals are gonna be saved and cleaned up on that big ol' day when the world gets right—Just like what Isaiah said.
In that day, seven women are gonna latch onto one feller, sayin’: We’ll rustle up our own grub and wear our own duds; just let us go by your name to clear our shame.
On that day, the Lord's branch will be a sight to behold, all pretty and fancy; the harvest will be first-rate and good-lookin’ for them folks who made it outta Israel.
And it’ll come to pass that them folks left in Zion and still in Jerusalem will be called holy, every last soul listed among the living in Jerusalem—
Once the Good Lord washes off the muck from the daughters of Zion and cleans the blood of Jerusalem outta there with the spirit of judgment and the fire of purification.
And the Lord’s gonna put a cloud and smoke over every homestead on Mount Zion and over her gatherings, a blazing fire by night; for on all the glory of Zion, there’ll be a shield.
And there’ll be a shelter to offer some shade in the heat of the day and a safe spot from storms and rain.
