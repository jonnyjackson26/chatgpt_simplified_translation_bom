Well now, listen up, partner. Here’s how that text rides out in a cowboy dialect:
The gloom ain't gonna last like it did when Zebulun and Naphtali first got a taste of trouble. They took a hit back yonder near the Red Sea and over by Jordan, out in Galilee where folks ain't never seen much luck.
Them folks wanderin' 'round in the dark have spotted a mighty fine light; folks livin' in the shadow of death got that light shining right on 'em.
You've sure grown this here nation and brought forth a heap of joy. They’re whoopin’ it up like there's a harvest celebration, just like cowhands do when they divvy up the spoils after a good raid.
You done busted the chains that weighed heavy on your shoulders and tossed away the whip of your oppressor.
Warriors' fights are all about the ruckus, loud as a stampede, and their clothes soaked in blood; but this here will be fueled by fire and heat unlike any battle before.
A young'un’s comin' on into the world, a son’s been given to us. The weight of all the land’s rule will rest on his shoulders; folks will call him Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, and Prince of Peace.
His rule and the peace it brings ain't got no end, settlin' on David’s throne, givin' order and makin' it right with justice from here on out, and forevermore. The Lord of Hosts is all fired up to make it happen.
The Lord sent His word to Jacob, and it's landed all heavy on Israel.
And folks all around—ain't no exceptions, even Ephraim and them in Samaria—yellin’ loud and proud like they own the place:
Them bricks may have tumbled down, but we’re fixin’ to build with good-cut stone; them sycamores might be chopped, but we’ll swap 'em for some mighty cedars.
So, the Lord's gonna set up foes against Rezin and round up his enemies.
The Syrians are on one side and the Philistines on the other, and they’ll be ready to gobble up Israel whole. Even with all this, His fury ain't cooled down, His hand still reachin' out.
But the people ain’t turnin' back to the one who gives 'em a smackdown, nor are they seekin’ the Lord of Hosts.
So the Lord's goin’ to chop off head and tail, branch and rush all in one swift go.
The old-timers, they’re the head; and the lying prophets, they’re the tail.
The folks in charge lead this crowd astray, and the ones followin’ 'em are headin’ for ruin.
So, the Lord ain’t gonna find joy in the young bloods, nor will He show mercy on the orphans and widows; every last one of 'em is a hypocrite and up to no good, mouth flappin' with foolishness. Even with all this, His anger ain’t turned away, and His hand is still stretched out.
Wickedness burns like prairie fire; it'll consume thorns and briars, blazing through the woods until it billows up like thick smoke.
The wrath of the Lord of Hosts is darkenin' the land, and folks are like firewood; no man will go easy on his brother.
He’ll be reachin’ for food on his right but feelin’ empty; grabbin’ with his left, but it ain’t fillin’ him up either; every man’s gonna be gnawin’ on his own arm—
Manasseh’s up against Ephraim, and Ephraim’s fixin’ for Manasseh; they’ll be joinin’ forces against Judah. Even with all this, His anger still ain’t turned away, and His hand is still stretched out.
