In the promised land of the future, every soul will tip their hat to the Good Lord—He’ll be right there with ‘em—just like Isaiah mentioned back in the day.
And on that fine day, you’ll be sayin’: “O Lord, I’ll lift my voice in praise; even though you was mad at me, you’ve cooled your heels, and now you’ve wrapped me in comfort.”
Just look here, God’s my savin’ grace; I’ll put my trust in Him, ain’t got no need to fret; ‘cause the Lord Almighty’s my muscle and my tune; He’s also my way to salvation.
So, with a heart full of joy, you’ll draw water straight from the wells of salvation.
And on that special day, you’ll be shoutin’: “Praise the Lord, call out His name, spread the word about what He’s done among the folks, make sure to let ‘em know His name’s the highest of all.”
Sing out to the Lord; He’s done some mighty fine things; news of His deeds is spreadin’ far and wide all over the land.
Let loose a shout and raise some dust, you folks livin’ in Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is right there in your midst, and He’s a sight to behold.
