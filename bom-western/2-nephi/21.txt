A shoot's gonna spring up from Jesse's kin, and a branch'll sprout from his roots.  
The Spirit of the Good Lord will settle on him, granting him wisdom and understanding, counsel and strength, knowledge, and a healthy respect for the Lord.  
He'll be quick to pick up on the ways of the Lord; he ain't gonna judge folks by what he sees or hears.  
But he'll judge the less fortunate with fairness, and use equity for them gentle souls; he’ll strike the earth with the words he speaks, and his breath will do in the wicked.  
Righteousness'll be his belt, and faithfulness’ll hold him up like a trusty saddle.  
The wolf and the lamb's gonna share a pasture, the leopard will curl up next to the kid, and the calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf will all be together; a little tyke'll lead 'em all.  
The cow and the bear'll munch side by side, their young'un slumberin' together; the lion will chomp on grass like a good old cow.  
A baby’s gonna play near a snake pit, and a weaned child’ll put his hand on a nest of vipers.  
They won't do no harm or destruction in all my sacred territory, for the land'll be filled with knowledge of the Lord, like the waters cover the ocean.  
And when that day rolls around, there'll be a root from Jesse, actin’ as a banner for the folks; the gentiles'll come seekin' it, and his rest'll be downright glorious.  
It’ll come to pass that the Lord’ll lend a hand again to gather the stragglers of his people still left over, from Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and the islands of the sea.  
He'll raise up a flag for the nations, wranglin’ up the outcasts of Israel, and collect the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth.  
The jealousy among Ephraim will fade, and those pesky foes of Judah will be cut off; Ephraim won’t feel envy for Judah, and Judah won’t harass Ephraim.  
But they’ll take to the skies on the backs of the Philistines toward the west; they'll plunder the east together and have their way with Edom and Moab; the children of Ammon will heed their call.  
And the Lord's gonna wipe out the Egyptian sea's tongue; with a mighty gust, he’ll wave his hand over the river, splitting it into seven streams, making folks cross dry as a bone.  
And there'll be a clear path for the remnant of his people still standing, from Assyria, just like it was for Israel when they busted loose from Egypt.
