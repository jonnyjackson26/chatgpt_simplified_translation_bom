The Book of Mormon is a hefty volume of holy scripture, a real piece of the good book, kinda like the Bible. It’s a record of how the Almighty dealt with the folks who roamed the Americas way back when and packs the whole kit and caboodle of the everlasting gospel.
Now, this here book was penned by many old-timey prophets, guided by the spirit of prophecy and divine insight. These fellas carved their words on gold plates, which were later quoted and patched together by a prophet-historian named Mormon. This record tells the tale of two mighty civilizations. One of 'em hit the road from Jerusalem around 600 B.C., splitting into two nations known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other bunch showed up long before that, when the Big Guy mixed up the languages at the Tower of Babel, and they went by the name of the Jaredites. After thousands of moons, all met their end except the Lamanites, who are kin to the American Indians today.
The biggest event captured in the Book of Mormon is when the Lord Jesus Christ rode into town among the Nephites real soon after He rose from the dead. It lays out the gospel’s teachings, maps out the plan of salvation, and tells folks what they gotta do to find peace in this life and a ticket to eternal glory in the next.
Once Mormon finished scribblin' down his tales, he handed the account over to his son Moroni, who slapped on a few of his own words and stashed the plates up in the Hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, that same Moroni, now all glorified and back from the dead, showed up to the Prophet Joseph Smith and gave him the scoop about the ancient record and its mission to be translated into English.
In time, the plates found their way to Joseph Smith, who translated 'em all thanks to the good Lord's gift and power. Now, this record is out there in many tongues, serving as a fresh and added witness that Jesus Christ is the living God’s Son, and that anyone who comes to Him and follows the rules of His gospel can find salvation.
The Prophet Joseph Smith made it clear: “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other book.”
Alongside Joseph Smith, the Lord made sure eleven more folks laid eyes on the gold plates and bore witness to the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their penned testimonies are here as “The Testimony of Three Witnesses” and “The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.”
We reckon folks everywhere oughta pick up the Book of Mormon, chew on its message, and then holler at God, the Eternal Father, in Christ’s name, to find out if it’s true. Those who take this route and ask with faith will be blessed with a testimony of its truth and divine nature through the power of the Holy Spirit. (See Moroni 10:3–5.)
Those who receive this heavenly witness from the Holy Spirit will also come to see through that same power that Jesus Christ is the world's Savior, that Joseph Smith is His revelator and prophet for these latter days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord’s kingdom, once again established on this here earth, gettin' ready for the Second Coming of the Messiah.
