Well now, Nephi set out to create himself two bunches of records—Them’s called the plates of Nephi—The big ones hold the everyday happenings; the smaller ones are mostly about the holy stuff. This all went down way back ’round 600–592 B.C.
My pa, he saw and heard a whole heap of things while settin’ up camp in a tent down in the valley of Lemuel, and there’s a pile more that just ain’t fit to fit on these here plates.
Now, as I’m jawin’ ’bout these plates, I reckon they ain’t the ones where I spill all the beans about my kin; nope, the ones I use for that story’s got the name Nephi slapped on ‘em; hence, they’re called the plates of Nephi, after yours truly; and these other plates are also named the plates of Nephi.
Still and all, I’ve been given a word from the Lord, tellin’ me to craft these plates for a real good reason, which I reckon I don’t fully grasp.
On them other plates, I’ll be puttin’ down the tale of the kings’ reigns, along with the tussles and strifes of my folks; so, these here plates are mainly about the ministry, while the other ones focus more on the kings and the bumps along the road my people have traveled.
So, the Lord’s tasked me with makin’ these plates for a wise purpose that I ain't got the foggiest idea about.
But the Lord's got his fingers in all pies from the get-go; hence, he’s got a plan to see through all his works 'mongst the children of men; for sure, he’s got the might to make good on all his promises. And that’s the way the cowpoke rides. Amen.
