Well, let me tell ya what happened next. I had a powwow with my brothers and said, "Let’s ride on back to Jerusalem and do right by the Lord's commands, 'cause He's bigger and badder than anyone on this blue planet. So if He can handle everything else, sure as shootin’ He can take on Laban and his gang of fifty—heck, even all his thousands."
So off we went, strong like Moses. That fella told the waters to part during the Red Sea stir, and sure enough, they split right down the middle. Our folks got outta slavery on dry land, while Pharaoh's bunch went down like a sack of potatoes in the drink.
Now, y’all know this truth, and you’ve also had a winged messenger talk to ya; so why the doubt? Let's saddle up, 'cause the Lord can get us through, just like our forebears, and he can take care of Laban, just like He did the Egyptians.
But when I finished, they were still mad as a hornet's nest and grumble-bumbling along, yet they trailed behind me ‘til we were right outside Jerusalem's walls.
And lemme tell ya, it was nighttime. I told ‘em to lay low by the walls. Once they got hid, I, Nephi, crept into the town and headed for Laban’s place.
I was guided by the Spirit, not knowin’ in advance what kind of trouble I was gettin’ into.
But I pressed on, and when I got close to Laban’s shack, I spotted a fella sprawled out on the ground, face down, playin’ drunk as a skunk.
And lo and behold, it was Laban.
I saw his shiny sword stuck in its sheath; the hilt was pure gold and crafted real fine. Even in the moonlight, that blade looked like the best steel around.
Then the Spirit spoke to me, urging me that I should take care of Laban. But in my heart, I thought, "I ain't never killed a man.” I shivered at the thought and hoped to steer clear of that.
Yet again, the Spirit whispered in my ear: "Looky here. The Lord’s put him right in your hands. And you know he wanted to snuff out your life, didn’t follow the Lord, and stole our stuff."
Then the Spirit said again: "Do it, 'cause the Lord’s brought him to you."
Fact is, sometimes the Lord takes down the wicked to get His good works done. It’s better for one fella to kick the bucket than for a whole nation to dwindle away in doubt.
So here I was, Nephi, taking in those words and rememberin’ the Lord’s promise to me during our wanderin’ in the wilderness: "As long as your folks keep my commandments, they’ll thrive in the promised land."
I also figured they couldn’t follow the Lord’s rules without Moses’s law, and I knew that law was on them brass plates.
I realized the Lord aimed for me to take down Laban so I could snag those records, just like He commanded.
So, I followed the Spirit’s leadin’, grabbed Laban by the hair, and took off his head with his own sword.
Once I had done the deed, I put Laban’s clothes on my own self, every piece, and strapped on his armor.
After that, I made my way to Laban’s treasury. As I approached, I spotted Laban's servant who had the keys to the cash box. I hollered at him in Laban’s voice, telling him he needed to come with me to the treasury.
He thought I was his master, Laban, 'cause he saw my fancy duds and the sword hangin’ from my waist.
He started jabbering about the old folks in Jerusalem, knowing Laban had been out visitin' ‘em at night.
I spoke to him just like Laban would.
I also told him that I was gonna take the engravings from the brass plates back to my older brothers, who were waitin' outside the walls.
Then I told him to follow me.
He figured I meant the church fellas and believed I was indeed Laban come back from the dead, so he followed along.
He chattered on about the elders of the Jews while we headed back to my brothers waitin’ outside.
But when Laman laid eyes on me, he looked like he saw a ghost, as did Lemuel and Sam. They took off faster than a jackrabbit, thinkin' I was Laban and I’d done been killed and was after them next.
I yelled after them and they heard me, so they stopped runnin’.
But when Laban's servant saw my brothers, he started shakin' in his boots and almost took off for the city of Jerusalem.
Now me, Nephi, being a big ol' fella with the strength the Lord blessed me with, I grabbed hold of Laban's servant and kept him from boltin’.
I told him if he listened to me, as the Lord lives and as I live, we’d spare his life.
I swore to him there was nothin’ to fear; he could be a free man like us if he’d join us out in the wilderness.
I laid it on him that the Lord commanded us to do this, so shouldn't we be diligent in keepin' His commandments? So, if he’d come with us to my father’s camp, he’d have a place with us.
And it turned out Zoram found some bravery in my words. That was the servant’s name, and he promised he’d head down into the wild with us. Yessiree, he swore he’d stick with us from then on.
We wanted him to stay close so the Jews wouldn’t catch wind of our getaway and come hunting us down.
Once Zoram made his oath, our worries about him started to fade away.
So, we rounded up the brass plates and Laban’s servant, then hitched it into the wilderness, making our way to Dad’s tent.
