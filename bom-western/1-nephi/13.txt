Well now, here’s what I’ve got for ya, cowboy style:  
And it happened that the angel hollered at me, sayin’: “Looky here!” And I turned my gaze and saw a whole heap of nations and kingdoms.  
And the angel asked, “What’re ya seein’?” And I replied, “I reckon I see a whole passel of nations and kingdoms.”  
And he told me, “These here are the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles.”  
And it came to pass that I spotted among the Gentiles the makin’ of a mighty big church.  
And the angel said to me, “Take a gander at this church bein' built, it’s the most wicked of 'em all, slayin’ the saints of God, tormentin’ ‘em, shacklin’ ‘em down, makin' ‘em wear a heavy yoke, and draggin’ 'em off into captivity.”  
And I beheld this gruesome church; I saw the devil was the one who started it.  
I also laid my eyes on gold, silver, fine silks, fancy reds, and the softest linens, and a whole bunch of dance hall darlins’ too.  
And the angel waxed on, sayin’: “Look at that gold, silver, silks, and the fancy duds—those be what this wicked church covets.”  
“And they sure enough ruin God’s saints for the applause of the world and drag ‘em into bondage.”  
Then I took a look and saw a heap of waters; they split the Gentiles from my kin.  
And the angel said, “The wrath of God’s aimed at your kinfolk.”  
Then I saw a man among the Gentiles, way far from my kin across those waters; and the Spirit of God come down, workin’ on him, sendin’ him across the waters to my kin in the promised land.  
I noticed the Spirit of God was also workin’ on other Gentiles; they made a break for freedom across the waters.  
And I beheld crowds of Gentiles in the promised land; I saw God’s wrath weighin’ heavy on my kin, scattered before the Gentiles, gettin’ whipped.  
I saw the Spirit of the Lord was upon the Gentiles; they struck it rich and claimed the land as their own, and I saw they was fair and mighty fine, just like my people was before they got killed.  
And I, Nephi, witnessed the Gentiles who broke free from captivity humblin’ themselves before the Lord, with the Lord’s power helpin’ ‘em.  
I saw their mother Gentiles gatherin’ by the waters and on land, ready to throw down against them.  
I noticed God’s might was behind them and that God’s anger was aimed at all those gatherin’ up to fight.  
I, Nephi, watched as the Gentiles who escaped captivity were saved by God’s strength, free from all the other nations.  
And it came to pass that I saw them hittin’ it big on the land; I spotted a book, bein’ passed around them.  
And the angel asked, “Do ya know what that book means?”  
And I told him, “Nope, I don’t know.”  
He said, “Looky here, it comes from the mouth of a Jew.” And I, Nephi, beheld it; the angel told me, “The book you see is the record of the Jews, full of God’s promises to Israel, holdin' many prophecies of the holy prophets; it's like those engravings on the brass plates, but not so many; still, they hold the Lord's covenants, worth a whole lot to the Gentiles.”  
And the Lord's angel told me, “You’ve seen that the book comes from a Jew; when it does, it’ll be chock-full of the gospel of the Lord, the one twelve apostles testify to, givin’ witness to the truth in the Lamb of God.”  
So, these things head out from the Jews nice and clean to the Gentiles, followin’ the truth that's in God.  
Once they carry it forth by the twelve apostles from the Jews to the Gentiles, ya see the setup of that big ol’ wicked church, most abhorrent of all; they’ve gone and snatched a bunch from the Lamb’s gospel—plain and pure parts—and many of the Lord’s covenants gone as well.  
They did this to twist the Lord’s true ways, blindin’ the eyes and hardenin’ the hearts of folks.  
So, you see that after the book's been passed out through the hands of that wicked church, a bunch of plain and precious bits get taken from the book, that book of the Lamb of God.  
After those plain and precious parts vanish, it heads out to all the Gentile nations; across the waters you’ve noticed, where the Gentiles escaped from captivity, ya see—a whole lotta people trippin’ up ‘cause they took away what was easy for folks to understand that was in the Lamb of God—lots of ‘em stumble, givin’ Satan a big ol’ hold on ‘em.  
But, you see, those Gentiles who’ve broken free from captivity and been raised by God’s power above all other nations on the finest land—the one God made a promise to your father that his kin would have as their inheritance; thus, ya see, the Lord God won’t let the Gentiles completely wipe out your kin that’s still among your brothers.  
Nor will He let ‘em destroy your brothers’ seed.  
The Lord God won’t permit the Gentiles to stay forever blind as a bat, which you see they are, due to the plain and precious bits of the Lamb’s gospel that’ve been held back by that wicked church, whose setup you’ve witnessed.  
So the Lamb of God says: “I’ll show mercy to the Gentiles, and I’ll visit the remnant of Israel in some real serious judgment.”  
Then it came to pass that the Lord’s angel spoke to me, sayin’: “Behold, the Lamb of God says, after I’ve checked in on Israel’s remnant—this remnant is your father’s seed—after I’m done judgin’ 'em, and I’ve laid a hand on them courtesy of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles trip up hard, ‘cause the plain and precious parts of the Lamb’s gospel are kept away by that abominable church, the mother of harlots, the Lamb says—I’ll be merciful to the Gentiles in that day, bringin’ much of my gospel to 'em with my own power, and it’ll be plain and valuable, says the Lamb.”  
“For, behold, says the Lamb: I’m gonna reveal myself to your seed, and they’ll write a heap of things I minister unto 'em, which will be plain and precious; and after your seed is wiped out, dwindle away in disbelief, along with your brothers’ seed—well, these writings will be stashed away, comin’ forth to the Gentiles by the gift and power of the Lamb.”  
“And in 'em will be written my gospel, says the Lamb, and my rock and my salvation.”  
And blessed are they who seek to raise up my Zion in that day, for they’ll have the gift and power of the Holy Ghost; and if they stick it out till the end, they’ll be lifted up on the last day and saved in the Lamb’s everlasting kingdom; and whoever spreads peace, good news and joy, oh, how beautiful they’ll be upon the mountains.  
Then I took a gander at the remnant of my kin, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had come from the mouth of a Jew, rollin’ on from the Gentiles to the remnant of my brethren.  
After it reached 'em, I saw other books, sent by the Lamb’s power, from Gentiles to 'em, to convince the Gentiles and the remnant of my kin, and also the Jews scattered all over, that the records of the prophets and twelve apostles of the Lamb are indeed true.  
And the angel said, “These last records you’ve seen among the Gentiles will confirm the truth of the first records from the twelve apostles of the Lamb, revealin’ the plain and precious bits that got taken away; and announcein’ to all folks, tribes, and languages that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father and the Savior of the world; and everyone’s gotta come to Him, or they ain’t gonna be saved.”  
And they gotta come according to the words that’ll be declared by the Lamb; and those words from the Lamb will resonate in the records of your seed, just like in the twelve apostles’ records; so they’ll both be unified in one, ‘cause there’s one God and one Shepherd over this here earth.  
And the day’ll come when He shows Himself to all nations, to the Jews and the Gentiles; and after He’s appeared to the Jews and Gentiles, He’ll show Himself again to the Gentiles and the Jews, where the last becomes the first, and the first becomes the last.
