Well now, let me spin y'all a tale 'bout a fella named Lehi, who was certain that them Jews was fixin’ to be rounded up and taken captive by the Babylonians. He yapped 'bout a mighty Savior comin' for the folks, a real Redeemer, and he also mentioned the one who’d dunk the Lamb of God in the water, just like a good cowboy roundin’ up cattle. Lehi spun yarns 'bout how this Messiah would kick the dust of death and stomp right back to life. He likened the huntin' and roundin' up of the Israelites to tendin' to a wild olive tree.
I, Nephi, reckon it’s time I laid out my story on these here plates, tellin’ about my doin's, my time sittin’ in the saddle, and my preachin’. So, I gotta share a bit about my old man and my brothers too.
Well, after my dad had finished chattin' 'bout that dream of his, and givin' everyone a good ol' nudge to work hard, he started jawin' 'bout them Jews.
He warned that after that grand ole town of Jerusalem fell apart, lots would be hauled off to Babylon, but in the Lord’s good time, they’d be brought back home, claimin' their land just like a rancher takes back what's his.
About six hundred years after my father took off from Jerusalem, the Big Man upstairs was gonna raise up a prophet among the Jews—a Messiah, or in simpler terms, a Savior for everyone.
And he also gabbed about prophets—lots of 'em—who had already declared these truths 'bout this Messiah, this Redeemer for all the world. 
So, everyone was lost and wanderin’, and they’d stay that way unless they leaned on this Redeemer.
My father also talked 'bout a prophet who'd show up ahead of the Messiah to clear the trail—
He’d be out hollerin’ in the wilderness: "Get ready for the Lord, make them paths straight; there’s someone amongst ya that you don’t even know; he’s tougher than a Texas steer, and I ain’t fit to so much as untie his bootstraps." My old man spoke a lot 'bout that.
He said this fella would dunk folks in a place called Bethabara, way past the Jordan, and that he'd be usin’ water to wash ‘em up; even that he’d be dunkin’ the Messiah himself in water.
Once he’d baptized the Messiah, he’d see and declare he’d dunked the Lamb of God, the one who takes away all the sins from the world.
Well, after my father finished talkin’ up all this, he turned to my brothers to share the gospel that’d be preached to the Jews, and how those folks were driftin’ away in disbelief. He said after they’d gone and done away with the Messiah, once he was killed, he’d rise up from the dead and show himself to the Gentiles through the Holy Ghost.
Yessiree, my father had plenty to say 'bout the Gentiles, and the house of Israel, likin’ ‘em to an olive tree whose branches would be snapped off and scattered all over the earth.
So, he proclaimed that we all oughta be led together into the promised land, fulfillin’ the word of the Lord, gettin’ scattered every which way across the earth.
Once the house of Israel got spread out, they’d come back together again; and after the Gentiles received the whole shebang of the Gospel, the wild olive tree’s branches—the leftovers from the house of Israel—would be grafted in, and they’d recognize the true Messiah, their Lord and Redeemer.
In this way, my father made prophecies and had a whole load more to say to my brothers that I reckon ain’t fit to nibble on in this here book, 'cause I’ve penned down only what was necessary for me in my other book.
All these happenings took place while my father was livin' in a tent down in the valley called Lemuel.
So after I, Nephi, heard every word from my father, all the things he saw in that vision, and the stuff he said by the power of the Holy Ghost— that ole power he had by havin' faith in the Son of God, who was the Messiah to come— I had a mighty strong wish to see, hear, and know these truths myself through that same Holy Ghost, which is a gift from God to anyone who seeks Him earnestly, just as folks did in the olden days and will do when He shows Himself to the children of men.
For He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever; the path’s been laid out for all folks since the very beginning, if they’ll just repent and head on over to Him.
For all who earnestly seek shall find; and the mysteries of God will unfold for 'em through the power of the Holy Ghost—just like now and back then, and in times to come; so all things with the Lord go 'round and 'round like a never-endin' cattle drive.
So remember this, good folks, 'cause for all your doin's, you’ll be brought before the judge.
If you’ve made mischief during your time here, you’ll be found unclean come judgment day, and no unclean thing can have a seat with God; so you’ll be cast out for good.
Now the Holy Ghost gives me the authority to share these truths, and I ain't gonna back down.
