Well now, here’s the tale of a fella named Nephi, who hails from good stock, no doubt about it. He grew up learnin’ all sorts of things from his pa, Lehi, and faced plenty of hardships in his day. Yet the good Lord was mighty kind to him, blessin’ him with a heap of wisdom about His goodness and secrets, and that's why he’s settin' down the record of his life.
Yup, he’s writin’ this tale in the lingo of his kinfolk, mixin’ the learnin’ of the Jews with the tongue of the Egyptians.
And let me tell ya, Nephi knows that what he’s scribblin' down is the real McCoy; he’s writin’ it out by his own hands, after gatherin’ up all that he knows.
Now, it so happens that in the first year of King Zedekiah’s reign over Judah, while his old man, Lehi, was livin’ it up in Jerusalem, a whole passel of prophets came burstin’ in, warnin’ folks to straighten up or their mighty city would meet its end.
So, Lehi—my dad, mind ya—took to the streets, prayin’ mightily to the Lord for his people, heart and soul, reachin’ out with all he had.
Lo and behold, while he was prayin’ up a storm, a blazing pillar of fire showed up, settin' itself right on a rock in front of him; he saw and heard a whole heap of things, and it made him shake like a leaf.
Once he got back to his own digs in Jerusalem, he flung himself onto his bed, feelin’ swept away by the Spirit and all them sights he had witnessed.
Well, bein’ wrapped up in the Spirit, he got caught up in a vision and saw the heavens swing wide open, and there was God sittin’ on His throne, surrounded by a whole army of angels who were singin’ and givin’ praise to their Creator.
Next thing he knew, he spotted One comin’ down from the skies, lookin’ shinier than the sun at high noon.
And right behind Him were twelve others, shining brighter than a swarm of stars in the night sky.
They came down and roamed about on the earth, and the first of 'em strolled up to my father, handin’ him a book and tellin’ him to give it a read.
As he read that book, the Spirit of the Lord filled him right up.
He read out loud: “Whoah, whoah, Jerusalem, you’re in deep trouble! I can see your wicked ways!” Yup, he read a whole bunch about how that city was headin’ for destruction, with folks meetin’ their end by the sword, and many bein’ dragged off to Babylon as captives.
When my father finished readin’ and takin’ in all them marvelous visions, he couldn’t keep quiet; he praised the Good Lord with shouts like, “Great and wondrous are Your works, Almighty God! Your throne's up high in the heavens, and Your power, kindness, and mercy reaches every soul on this earth; and ‘cause You’re so merciful, You ain't gonna let folks who come to You be lost forever!”
That was how my father praised God, his heart was sure full of joy over all the visions the Lord showed him.
Now, as for me, Nephi, I ain't tellin’ all the tales my father penned, 'cause he wrote down a whole heap of what he saw in dreams and visions and a lot of other wisdom he shared with his kin that I ain’t gonna cover fully.
Instead, I’ll share the goings-on of my own life. Hear me now, I’m puttin’ together an abridged version of my dad’s record on some plates I crafted with my own hands; once I’ve summed up his tale, I’ll spin my own yarn.
So, I reckon ya oughta know that after the Lord showed my father, Lehi, so many miraculous things regarding Jerusalem’s demise, he hit the ground runnin’, prophesyin’ to the folks about all he seen and heard.
And sure enough, the Jews mocked him for the things he was hollerin’ about; he surely hit the nail on the head about their wickedness and their disgraceful acts; he testified loud and clear that what he saw and heard, and the words in that book, pointed straight at the coming of the Messiah and the redemption of the world.
Well, when the Jews caught wind of this, they got mighty riled up; just like the prophets gone by that they had tossed out, stoned, and even killed; they wanted to take my father’s life too. But you watch, I, Nephi, will show you how the Lord’s tender mercies are ever present for those He’s chosen, thanks to their faith, givin’ ‘em strength for deliverance.
