Israel's gonna be spread out all across the wild frontier—The Gentiles will take care of 'em with the good word in the last days—Israel will be gathered up and saved, while the wicked will burn like dried grass—The devil’s gang will be wiped out, and ol' Satan will be tied down tight.
So it happened that after I, Nephi, read these here engravings on the brass plates, my brothers rode up to me and asked: What in tarnation does this mean? Are we s’posed to understand it in a spiritual way, that’ll happen according to the spirit and not just the flesh?
And I, Nephi, replied to 'em: Well, these things were shown to the prophet by the Spirit’s voice; 'cause by the Spirit, all truths are revealed to the prophets, which'll come to pass for the folks in the flesh.
So listen here, what I’ve been readin’ is about both the here-and-now and the spiritual side of things; looks like the house of Israel will be scattered far and wide across the earth, and among all nations, sooner or later.
And dang, there’s many folks who’ve already lost touch with the good folks in Jerusalem. Most of the tribes have been led astray; they’re tossed around like tumbleweeds on the sea’s islands, and where they are, we can’t say, except that they’ve been led away.
And since they’ve been led astray, there’s been some prophesying done 'bout 'em, and also about all them who’ll be scattered and confused in the future, thanks to the Holy One of Israel; they’ll harden their hearts against Him, and so they'll be scattered amongst all nations and folks will hate 'em.
Yet, after being nursed by the Gentiles, when the Lord lifts His hand over 'em and sets them up like a banner, and their kids are held in their arms, and their daughters are carried on their shoulders, reckon these spoken things are of the worldly kind; for that’s how the Lord’s covenants with our ancestors work; and it means us in the days ahead, and our brethren from the house of Israel too.
And it means the time will come that after all the house of Israel is scattered and in a pickle, the Lord God will raise up a strong nation among the Gentiles, right here on this land; and through ‘em, our descendants will be spread out.
And after our descendants are scattered, the Lord God will go ahead and do a mighty thing among the Gentiles, which’ll be real valuable for our kin; kinda like they’re bein’ cared for by the Gentiles, held up in their arms and on their shoulders.
And it’ll mean a lot to the Gentiles too; not just to 'em, but to all the house of Israel, to make known the covenants of the Heavenly Father to Abraham, sayin’: In yer line shall all the folks of the earth be blessed.
And I wish, my brothers, that y’all knew that all the folks on this here earth can’t be blessed unless He swings His mighty arm in front of them nations.
So, the Lord God’s gonna pull up His sleeve for all the nations, bringin' His covenants and His gospel to the folks of the house of Israel.
He’s gonna haul 'em back outta captivity, gather ‘em to their rightful lands; they’ll come outta the shadows and darkness; they'll know that the Lord is their Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.
And the blood of that wicked church, which is a right foul one of the earth, will turn back on their own heads; they’ll be fightin’ amongst themselves, and the sword they wield will come back to bite 'em, and they’ll be drunk on their own blood.
And every nation that takes up arms against you, O house of Israel, will turn against one another, and they'll stumble into the pit they dug to catch the Lord’s people. All them that fight against Zion will be wiped out, and that great whore, who twisted the Lord’s right ways, that great and vile church, will come crashing down and mighty will be its fall.
For look, the prophet says, the time is a-comin’ fast that Satan won’t have no hold over the hearts of men; 'cause the day ain’t far off when all the proud and wicked will be like dry grass, and that day they’ll be burnt up.
The time’s drawin’ near that God's wrath will be poured out on all men; He won’t let the wicked destroy the righteous.
So, He’ll protect the righteous by His might, even if it takes the full force of His anger to do it, and the righteous will be preserved, even while their enemies go up in flames. So, the righteous don’t need to fear; ‘cause the prophet says, they'll be saved, even if it’s by fire.
Listen up, brothers, these things gotta happen real soon; yep, blood, fire, and smoke are fixin’ to come; and it’s gotta be on this here earth; and it’s gonna come to men in the flesh if they choose to harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
The righteous ain’t gonna perish; the time surely must come that all who fight against Zion will be cut off.
And the Lord’s sure gonna pave a way for His folks, fulfillin' what Moses said: A prophet's gonna be raised up by the Lord your God, like me; him you oughta hear in everythin' he says. And it’ll happen that all who won’t listen to that prophet will be cast out amongst the people.
And now I, Nephi, tell ya straight, that this prophet Moses spoke of is the Holy One of Israel; He’s gonna settle things in righteous judgment.
And the righteous don’t need to worry; they ain't gonna be confounded. But it’s the devil’s kingdom that’ll rise up amongst men, that kingdom that’s rooted in the flesh—
For the time’s comin’ quick that all churches built for gain, and those built to seize power over the flesh, and ones built to be popular with the world, and those craving the fleshly lusts and worldly things, and doin' all kinds of wickedness; all those who belong to the devil’s kingdom are who need to fear, tremble, and shake; they'll be brought low to the dirt; they'll be consumed like dry grass; and this is according to the prophet’s words.
The time’s a-comin’ that the righteous will be led up like calves from the pen, and the Holy One of Israel will reign in power, might, and great glory.
And He’ll round up His children from the four corners of the earth; He’ll count His sheep, and they know Him; there'll be one fold and one shepherd; and He’ll feed His sheep, and they’ll find pasture in Him.
And on account of His people’s righteousness, ol’ Satan won't have no power; he won’t be able to stir up trouble for many years; he’s got no power over the hearts of the folks, ‘cause they’re livin' in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel’s in charge.
And now look, I, Nephi, say to ya that all these things gotta happen according to the flesh.
But, look, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and folks will be safe in the Holy One of Israel if they choose to repent.
And now I, Nephi, reckon I’m done; I ain't plumb ready to keep jabberin’ ‘bout these things just yet.
So, my brothers, consider that what’s written on those brass plates is true; they show that a man’s gotta follow God’s commandments.
So, don’t think that just me and my dad are the only ones who’ve testified and taught 'em. If you’ll stick to the commandments and hold out till the end, you’ll be saved in the last round. And that’s the gospel truth. Amen.
