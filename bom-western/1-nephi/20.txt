Listen up, you folks of the house of Jacob, them that go by the name of Israel, who’ve come up outta the waters of Judah, or reckonin’ from the waters of baptism, who holler out by the name of the Lord, and give a shout-out to the God of Israel, but ain't swearing true or actin’ right.
Even so, they like to call themselves part of the holy city, but they ain't leanin' on the God of Israel, who’s the Boss of all hosts; yep, that’s the name he goes by.
Well now, I’ve spilled the beans ‘bout the past right from the start, and it all came outta my mouth, quick as a whip. I showed ‘em, sharp as a tack.
I did this ‘cause I knew you was stubborn, with a neck as tough as iron and a brow as hard as brass;
And right from the get-go, I told you what was comin’; before it hit, I laid it out for you, so you wouldn’t go blamin’ your idol for it, nor your carved or molten image for givin’ the orders.
You’ve seen and heard all this; so why ain’t ya spreadin’ the word? I showed ya new stuff from now on, even secrets you didn’t know.
They’re made fresh now, not from the past; even before the day you didn’t catch wind of ‘em, I’d already laid ‘em out for you, so you can’t say—Hey, I knew that.
Yep, you didn’t catch a whisper; nope, you knew nothin’; from back then, your ear was shut tight. I knew you'd act all sneaky and be called a troublemaker from day one.
But for my name’s sake, I’ll hold off my anger, and for my own glory, I won’t cut you off just yet.
‘Cause, lookie here, I’ve fine-tuned ya, picked ya out in the tough times.
For my own sake, yes, for my own sake I’ll do this, ‘cause I won’t let my name be dragged through the mud, nor will I hand my glory to no one else.
Listen to me, Jacob, and Israel, my chosen; I’m the one; I’m the first, and I’m the last too.
My hand laid down the very ground you walk on, and my right hand stretched across the skies. I call out to ‘em, and they all stand tall.
Now all y’all gather around and listen; who’s out there that’s declared all this to ‘em? The Lord’s got a soft spot for him; indeed, he’ll keep his promise made through them folk; he'll do what he promised with Babylon, and his strength will land on the Chaldeans.
Also, says the Lord; I, the Lord, yep, I’ve spoken; sure as shootin’, I called him to shout it out, I’ve brought him along, and he’s gonna find his way prosperous.
Come on over here near me; I ain’t been talkin’ in the shadows; from the very start, since it was said, I’ve been yappin’; and the Lord God, along with his Spirit, has sent me.
And this is what the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, says; I’ve sent him, your God who teaches you how to thrive, who’s guiding you in the right direction, he’s the one that done it.
Oh if only you’d listened to my commands—then your peace would have flowed like a river, and your righteousness like the rolling waves of the sea.
Your children would’ve been like the sand; your descendants as plentiful as the gravel; their name wouldn’t have been cut off nor wiped out from before me.
Get on outta Babylon, run from the Chaldeans, and with a singin’ voice declare this, shout it to the ends of the earth; say: The Lord’s rescued his servant Jacob.
And they didn’t thirst; he led ‘em through the wilderness; made the waters gush outta the rock for ‘em; he split the rock and the waters poured out.
And even with all that he’s done, and even more besides, there ain’t no peace, says the Lord, for the wicked.
