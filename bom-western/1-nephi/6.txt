Nephi's talkin’ 'bout the big fella up yonder—his aim's to wrangle folks into findin’ the God of Abraham and gettin' themselves saved. Back in the days of 600–592 B.C.
Well now, I, Nephi, ain’t gonna spin the yarn ‘bout my folks’ family tree in this here record; and I reckon I won’t be doin’ it on these plates neither; it’s already written in the scrolls kept by my pop; so I ain’t puttin’ it in this work.
It’s good enough for me to say we’re kin to Joseph.
And I ain't too bent on givin’ every last detail ‘bout my father’s escapades, ‘cause they just won’t fit on these plates, and I’m lookin’ to save room for the good word of God.
The whole point of what I'm doin' here is to rustle up some folks to come to the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and find their salvation.
So, I won't be puttin’ down any of them worldly pleasures; I’m just fixin’ to write what pleases God and those who ain’t caught up in the ways of the world.
Therefore, I’m tellin’ my kin folks not to fill these plates with stuff that don’t mean much to the young'uns out there.
