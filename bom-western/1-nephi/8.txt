Well now, it turned out that we had rounded up all kinds of seeds—grains of every sort and also fruits of all shapes and sizes.
So it was that while my old man lingered in the wilds, he spoke to us, sayin’: "Look here, I had me a dream, or as folks might say, I’ve glimpsed a vision."
And lo and behold, ‘cause of what I saw, I sure was filled with gladness in the Lord for Nephi and Sam; I reckon they're gonna be just fine, along with a whole passel of their descendants.
But Laman and Lemuel, I was a mite worried about you two; in my dream, I reckon I beheld a dark and dreary desert.
Then I happened to spy a fella in a white coat; he strolled right up and stood before me.
He spoke to me, tellin’ me to follow him.
As I trailed behind him, I found myself in a dark and dismal wasteland.
After wanderin' for hours in that blackness, I started to pray to the Lord, askin’ for mercy, full as a cowboy's heart can be.
Eventually, after I put in a word with the Lord, I laid my eyes on a vast and open field.
And lo and behold, there stood a tree, with fruit that looked mighty fine, just what a person’d want for happiness.
I walked up and partook of that fruit; it was sweeter than anything I’d ever tasted before. And let me tell ya, it was whiter than any white I’d ever laid eyes on.
As I savored that fruit, my heart swelled with pure joy; I started wantin’ my kin to taste it too, 'cause I knew it was better than all other fruit out there.
Lookin’ around, hopin’ to find my folks, I spotted a river runnin’ nearby, flowin’ right by the tree where I was enjoyin’ that fruit.
I squinted to see where that river was comin’ from, and not too far up, I saw your ma, Sariah, along with Sam and Nephi—they were standin’ there lookin' lost.
So I waved 'em over and hollered for 'em to come join me in feasting on that fruit, which was the best there ever was.
Sure enough, they came on over and shared in the fruit too.
One thing I wanted real bad was for Laman and Lemuel to get a bite of that fruit as well; so I turned my gaze upstream, hopin’ to catch sight of them.
I did see ‘em, but they wouldn’t budge my way to partake of the fruit.
Then I spied a solid iron rod stretched along the riverbank, leading straight to the tree where I stood.
And there was a straight and narrow path runnin’ right next to that iron rod, goin’ to the tree where I stood; it also led up to the fountain, out to a grand and spacious field like a whole wild frontier.
I saw a huge crowd of folks makin’ their way, many tryin’ to grab hold of that path that led to the tree where I was.
So they set off down the path toward that tree.
But then, like a storm rollin’ in, a great mist of darkness arose; a mighty thick fog, so much so that those who started down that path got lost and wandered away.
I saw others pushin’ on, and they got hold of the iron rod; they didn’t let go as they pressed through the mist, hangin’ on tight until they reached the fruit of the tree.
Once they tasted that fruit, they looked around, full of shame.
And I turned my gaze too and spied across the river a big ol’ building, high up in the air, lookin’ down on everything.
It was packed with folks, young and old, men and women dressed in their finest. They were standin’ there laughin’ and pointin’ at those who were enjoyin’ the fruit.
After tastin’ that fruit, folks felt all shameful ‘cause of the mockin’ from the building and drifted off down forbidden paths, gettin’ lost.
Now I, Nephi, ain't spillin’ my father’s every word.
But to keep it short, he saw other groups pushin’ on; they grabbed the iron rod and kept their grip tight as they moved ahead, until they fell down and enjoyed the fruit of the tree.
He also saw more people feelin’ their way towards that grand ole building.
And lo and behold, many folks were drowned in the fountain’s depths; plenty wandered off the beaten path, strayin' into strange trails.
And a mighty throng entered that odd building. Once they crossed its threshold, they pointed fingers at me and others enjoyin’ the fruit, but we paid ‘em no mind.
These are my father’s words: those who listened to the scoffers ended up fallin’ away.
And my father said that Laman and Lemuel didn’t partake of that fruit.
When my father wrapped up his tale about his dream or vision, which was quite the lengthy yarn, he expressed deep concern for Laman and Lemuel; he feared they might get cast aside from the Lord's presence.
And he urged them with the heartfelt passion of a parent, implorin’ ‘em to listen to his words, hopin’ that the Lord might show 'em mercy and not cast ‘em off; indeed, my father sought to preach to them.
And after he preached and prophesied many things to 'em, he urged ‘em to keep the Lord’s commandments, and then he finished his talk.
