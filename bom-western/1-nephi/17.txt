Out on the prairie, we saddled up again and hit the trail, headin' nearly east from then on. We moved through a heap of hardships in the wilds, and our womenfolk were havin' babies right there in the wilderness.
The Lord blessed us so much that while we was munchin' on raw meats out there in the wild, our women were strong as bulls, givin' plenty of milk for the young'uns, bearin' their burdens without a peep of complaint.
So, it's clear as day that the Lord's commands gotta be carried out. If folks stick to what He says, He’ll feed 'em, give 'em strength, and set ‘em up for success; that's why He made sure we had what we needed while we were wanderin' in the wilderness.
We roamed around for a good many years, reckonin’ it was about eight years in the dust and dirt of the wild.
We finally rode into a land we named Bountiful, ‘cause it was full of fruit and sweet honey too; all of it set up by the Good Lord so we wouldn’t starve. We laid eyes on the sea, which we dubbed Irreantum, or, put in simpler words, many waters.
We set up our camp right by the shoreline; even after all that hard livin' and troubles we faced—so many we couldn’t even write 'em all—we felt a heap of joy when we hit that shoreline, callin' the spot Bountiful cause it had so much to eat.
After I, Nephi, had been in Bountiful for several days, the Lord’s voice rang out to me: “Get up and head to the mountain.” So I hightailed it up the mountain and cried out to the Lord.
Then the Lord spoke to me, sayin’: “You’re gonna build a ship, and I’ll show you how, so you can ferry your people across these waters.”
I asked, “Lord, where do I go to dig up ore so I can make tools to build that ship you told me about?”
The Lord laid it out for me where the good ore was, so I could fashion my tools.
So, I, Nephi, made me a bellows outta animal skins to stoke the fire, and once I had that bellows ready, I knocked two stones together to spark a flame.
The Lord hadn’t let us start too many fires while we were on the trail, ‘cause He said, “I’ll make your food tasty so you don't need to cook it.”
“I’ll also be your light while you wander, and I’ll clear the path for you if you keep my commands; stick to that, and you’ll be steered toward the promised land—you’ll see it’s me who’s guiding you.”
And the Lord said, “Once you’re in the promised land, you’ll know I’m the Almighty; I was the one who saved you from destruction, and I brought you out from Jerusalem.”
So, I, Nephi, did my best to follow the Lord's commands, and I urged my brothers to stay faithful and hardworking.
I went ahead and crafted tools from the ore I had melted down.
But when my brothers saw I was fixin’ to build a ship, they started grumblin' against me, sayin': “Our brother's a fool, thinkin' he can build a ship; heck, he thinks he can cross those vast waters!”
So they murmured against me, hopin’ they wouldn’t have to lift a finger, not believin’ I could build that ship nor that I’d even heard from the Lord.
I was mighty sorrowful ‘cause their hearts were so hard; when they noticed my sadness, they got all pleased, thinkin’ to themselves, “We knew he couldn't build a ship; he's just not too bright, no way he can do such a big job.”
They said I was just like our father, led astray by foolish dreams; they moaned ‘bout how he brought us out of Jerusalem, and now we’d been lost in the wilderness all these years; our womenfolk had to bear babies out there, sufferin’ every trial except for death; they claimed it would’ve been better had they died back in Jerusalem than goin’ through all this.
They noted all them years we’ve endured in this wilderness when we could have been comfy and happy back on our land, livin’ off what we owned.
And we knew folks back in Jerusalem were decent folks; they kept the Lord’s laws and commands in line with Moses’s law, so we knew they were the right sort of people. Our father had judged 'em and led us off 'cause we listened to his words; and they held that same grudge against me like he did. 
Then I, Nephi, asked 'em, “Do ya reckon our ancestors, the children of Israel, would’ve been led outta Egypt if they hadn’t listened to the Lord?”
“Do you think they could’ve busted outta bondage if the Lord hadn’t ordered Moses to lead ‘em out?”
You all know the Israelites were in chains, heavy with burdens hard to bear; sure, it was a good thing they got freed.
You also know that Moses was given the task by the Lord to lead that great mission, and by his word, the Red Sea split wide, and they walked through on dry land.
And sure as shootin’, the Egyptians got drowned in the Red Sea, those fellas in Pharaoh's army.
And don't forget, they had manna served to ‘em while they were wanderin’.
Yup, you also know Moses, by God’s power in him, whacked a rock, and fresh water flowed out for the Israelites to drink.
Even with all that leadin', the Lord their God, their Savior, went before ‘em, guiding 'em by day and shining a light at night, performin’ all the things necessary for folks to thrive, yet they hardened their hearts, closed their minds, and bad-mouthed Moses and the true God.
But just as He said, He took 'em down, led 'em out as He promised, and everything He did was by His word alone.
After they crossed that Jordan River, He gave ‘em strength to drive out the folks in the land, scattering 'em to ruin.
Now, do ya think the folks who lived in the promise land were good folks? I say no.
Do you think our ancestors woulda been better if they’d been righteous? I reckon not.
The Lord sees all folks alike; if you’re righteous, you’re favored by God. But they turned their back on God’s word, ripe for destruction; His wrath came upon ‘em; the Lord cursed their land and blessed it for our fathers. He did curse ‘em for ruin and bless our ancestors with power over it.
The Lord crafted this earth to be lived upon, and He made us to inhabit it.
He raises up good nations and brings the bad ones down.
He leads the righteous to fine lands, while the wicked He wipes out and curses the land for their sake.
He’s high up in the heavens, that's His throne, while this earth’s His footstool.
He loves those who choose Him to be their God. He loved our forefathers and made a covenant with ‘em—yup, even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; He remembered those promises and brought 'em outta Egypt.
He put ‘em through tests in the wilderness 'cause their hearts were hard, just like yours; the Lord put ‘em through it ‘cause of their wrongdoings. He sent venomous snakes among 'em, and once they got bitten, He found a way for ‘em to be healed; all they had to do was look, yet plenty died 'cause they couldn’t believe a simple thing.
Time and again, they hardened their hearts, bad mouthed Moses and even God; still, y’all know they were led by His unmatched power into the promise land.
Now, after all this, the time has come for ‘em to get wicked—a guessin’ they’re nearly ripe for the pickin’; I can’t help but think they’re about to get wiped out soon, ‘cept for a handful who'll be led away into bondage.
So, the Lord told my father to take off into the wilderness; the Jews were out to take his life too; just like you all have sought to do him harm; you’re murderers at heart just like ‘em.
You’re quick to chase after wrongdoing but slow to remember your God. You’ve seen an angel talk to you; you heard his voice more than a few times; he spoke to you soft-like, but you were too numb to feel it; so he spoke to you like thunder, shakin' the ground like it might split apart.
And you know, by His almighty word, He can cause the earth to fade away; by His word, He can make rough paths smooth, and tear up the flat places. So why, oh why, is your heart so stubborn?
My soul’s torn apart with worry for you, and my heart aches; I’m scared you’ll be cast off forever. I’m filled with the Spirit of God, to the point I hardly have the strength to stand.
So, it happened that once I laid all that out, they got real mad at me, wantin’ to toss me into the sea; as they stepped up to grab me, I called out, “In the name of the Almighty God, I command you not to touch me, for I’m filled with His power, strong enough to consume my flesh; anyone that lays a hand on me'll wither like a dried reed and mean nuthin' before the might of God; He will strike 'em down.”
Then I, Nephi, declared to ‘em that they oughta quit their mumblin' against our father; they should stop holdin’ back their labor from me, ‘cause God commanded I build a ship.
I told ‘em, “If God tells me to do anything, I can do it! If He bids me tell this water to change to land, by golly, it’ll be land; if I say it, it’ll happen.”
Now, if the Lord holds such mighty power, and pulls off all sorts of miracles among folks, how can He not point me in the right direction to craft that ship?
I reckon I said a whole lot to my brothers, so much it left ‘em dumbfounded, and they couldn’t fight back; they didn’t dare touch me for many days; they were too scared of witherin’ away right in front of me from the Spirit of God—they knew how powerful it was.
The Lord told me: “Reach out your hand again to your brothers, and they won't wither away in front of you; I’ll shake ‘em up, says the Lord, and this I’ll do so they know I’m the Lord their God.”
So, I reached out my hand toward my brothers, and they didn’t wither; but the Lord shook 'em up just like He said He would.
Then they admitted, “We know for sure the Lord’s with you, for it’s clear His power's shaken us up.” They fell down before me, about to worship me, but I wouldn’t let ‘em, sayin’: “I’m your brother, even the younger one; so worship the Lord your God, and honor your folks, so you can have long lives in the promised land He’ll give you.”
