The Amlicites done marked themselves up just like the prophets said—The Lamanites were sure feelin' the heat for their wayward ways—Folks sure do bring their own troubles on themselves—The Nephites took down another Lamanite bunch. 'Bout 87–86 B.C.
And it happened that the Nephites who weren’t cut down by the fightin’ folks, after they buried their fallen—now there were so many dead, they didn’t even keep count—once they finished layin’ their kin to rest, they all headed back to their land, their homes, and to their wives and young'uns.
Now a heap of women and kids bit the dust from sword strikes, and plenty of their livestock got wiped out too; not to mention many of their crops got smashed flat by them stampedin’ hordes.
And now a good number of the Lamanites and Amlicites that got taken down by the river Sidon found themselves tossed into them waters; and lo and behold, their bones now restin' way down deep in the sea, and there sure are a lot of 'em.
And the Amlicites stood out from the Nephites, ‘cause they put red marks on their foreheads just like them Lamanites; but they didn’t go and shave their heads off like the Lamanites did.
Now the Lamanites done had their heads shaved; and they were wearin’ nothin’ but their skins wrapped 'round their waists, along with their armor, bows, arrows, stones, and slings, all strapped on tight.
And the skin of the Lamanites was dark as night, just like the mark set upon their fathers, which was a curse 'cause of their misdeeds and their rebellion against their kinfolk, who were Nephi, Jacob, Joseph, and Sam, all good and righteous men.
And their brothers were out to bring ‘em down, thus they found themselves cursed; and the Lord God set a mark on ‘em, yes sir, on Laman and Lemuel, and all them sons of Ishmael, and the Ishmaelite gals.
This was to make sure their offspring was kept apart from their kin, so the Lord God could keep his people straight and narrow, so they wouldn’t mix up and take on false beliefs that’d lead to their downfall.
And it came to pass that anyone who mixed his seed with the Lamanites brought the same curse on his own kids.
So, any fella who let them Lamanites sway him ended up wearin’ that mark too.
And it happened that all who wouldn’t buy into the Lamanite ways, but instead believed in them records from Jerusalem, and stuck to the right ways of their forebears, who followed God’s commandments, were called Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that day forth—
And them are the folks who kept the true records of their people, along with the records of the Lamanites.
Now let’s circle back to the Amlicites, 'cause they also slapped a mark on themselves; yep, they went and put a red mark on their foreheads.
Thus the word of God came to pass, 'cause these are the words he spoke to Nephi: Look yonder, I done cursed the Lamanites, and I’ll put a mark on ‘em so they and their kin stay clear of you and your folks, from this day on and forevermore, ‘less they turn from their wicked ways and come back to me for mercy.
And again: I’ll set a mark on anyone who mixes his seed with your kin, so they’ll be cursed too.
And once more: I’ll lay a mark on anyone who fights against you and your folks.
And again, I say, whoever leaves you won’t be called your kin no more; and I’ll bless you and anyone else called your seed from now on and forever; and these were God’s promises made to Nephi and his lineage.
Now the Amlicites didn’t know they were doin’ God’s bidding when they started markin’ their foreheads; still, they rode out in open defiance against God; so it made sense for the curse to fall on them.
Now I want y’all to see they brought this curse on themselves; and every man that finds himself cursed just invites his own misery.
Well, it came to pass that not many days after the rumble in the land of Zarahemla between the Lamanites and Amlicites, another Lamanite army came rollin’ into Nephi's territory, same spot where the first army met the Amlicites.
And it came to pass that they sent out an army to run ‘em off their land.
Now Alma, bein’ laid up from a wound, didn’t ride into battle this time against the Lamanites;
But he sent a mighty crew against ‘em; they rode out and took down many of the Lamanites and sent the rest scamperin’ outta their land.
Then they came back and started settlin’ down to peace in the land, not bothered by their enemies for a spell.
Now all these skirmishes and feuds kicked off and wrapped up in the fifth year of the judges’ reign.
And in just one year, thousands upon thousands of souls moved on to the great beyond, ready to take their rewards based on their works, whether they were righteous or wicked, to face eternal joy or eternal sorrow, based on which spirit they chose to follow, good or bad.
For every man gets his pay from the one he chooses to follow, and that's just how prophecy rolls; so let’s keep it true. And thus ends the fifth year of the judges’ reign.
