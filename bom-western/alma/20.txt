Well, it was a time when them good folks set up a church in that neck of the woods, and King Lamoni, bless his heart, figured he’d take Ammon along to Nephi to introduce him to his old man.
Then the Good Lord hollered at Ammon, sayin’, "Hold your horses! Don’t you be ridin’ up to Nephi, ’cause that king's got a mind to take you out; instead, you gotta ride on over to Middoni, where your kinfolk Aaron, Muloki, and Ammah are sittin’ behind bars."
Once Ammon caught wind of that, he turned to Lamoni and said, "Well now, my brother's stuck in that Middoni jail, and I’m fixin’ to free ‘em."
Lamoni replied, "I know you got the Lord’s strength in ya, and you can handle anything. But I reckon I’ll tag along to Middoni because the king there, Antiomno, is a friend of mine. I’ll sweet-talk him into lettin’ your brothers out. But I gotta ask, who spilled the beans about your kin bein' in the slammer?"
Ammon told him, "Ain’t nobody told me nothin’ ’cept for God; He gave me the word to go and rescue my brothers stuck in that Middoni prison."
Well, Lamoni, takin’ a hint, got his hands on some horses and chariots for the trip.
He said to Ammon, "Alright partner, let’s head on down to Middoni, and I’ll put in a good word with the king to spring your brothers."
As they were makin’ tracks, they ran smack dab into Lamoni’s pa, who was the king over the whole shebang.
And that old king barked at Lamoni, "What in tarnation? Why didn’t you come to the shindig I threw for my boys and folks?"
Then he squinted his eyes at Ammon and spat, "Where are you headin’ off to with this Nephite fella, who hails from the breed of liars?"
So Lamoni, feelin’ a bit nervous, laid it all out for his pop, explainin’ his reasons for bein' away from the feast.
And when Lamoni finished tellin' all that, wouldn’t ya know, his father got riled up and said, "Lamoni, you’re fixin’ to rescue them Nephites, who’re sons of a cunning deceiver. Don’t forget, their kin robbed us blind; now they’re back, scamin’ us with their lies again, lookin’ to take our hard-earned stuff!"
Then Lamoni’s daddy ordered him to draw his sword and take Ammon down. He also demanded that Lamoni leave Middoni and come back home to Ishmael.
But Lamoni stood his ground and said, "I ain't killin’ Ammon, nor am I packin’ it back to Ishmael; I’m off to Middoni to free Ammon's brothers, ‘cause I know they’re good folks and true men of God."
His old man was fit to be tied when he heard that, and he pulled out his sword, ready to drop Lamoni right where he stood.
But Ammon stepped up and said, "Hold on there, don’t go cuttin’ down your own blood; better you take a tumble than your son. That boy here has turned away from his wrongdoings, but if you take your anger out on him, your soul will be in a heap of trouble."
"And listen, it’d be wise to hold off; if you do kill your own son, innocent blood will be cryin’ out for payback, and you might end up losin’ your own soul, too."
When Ammon finished speakin’, the king shot back, "I reckon if I do take my boy's life, I’d be spillin’ innocent blood, and it’s you who aimed to finish him off."
He reached out, tryin' to take Ammon down, but Ammon blocked him and struck his arm, leavin’ it limp.
Once the old king saw Ammon had the upper hand, he started pleadin’ for his life.
Ammon raised his sword and said, "Listen here, I ain’t gonna bring you low—unless you agree to let my brothers outta that jail."
Now, the king, shakin’ in his boots, said, "If you spare me, I’ll give you whatever you want, even half my kingdom!"
When Ammon realized he had the king right where he wanted him, he said, "Only if you promise me my brothers get released from prison, and Lamoni keeps his kingdom, and you don’t get riled up at him no more. Let him run things his way, and we'll call it even. Otherwise, I’ll have to put you down."
When Ammon laid that out, the king started feelin’ mighty grateful to still be breathin’.
And when he clocked that Ammon meant no harm, and saw how much Ammon cared for his boy, he was shocked, and said, "You just want me to let your brothers out and let Lamoni keep his kingdom? Well, partner, I’ll make sure from this day on that Lamoni's our king, and I’m done givin’ him orders."
"And I promise you, I’ll also let your brothers outta jail, and you and your kin can come see me anytime; I’d like to set eyes on ya. This king was flabbergasted by the whole deal, thinkin’ hard ‘bout what was said."
So Ammon and Lamoni kept on their way to Middoni. Lamoni found favor with the king there, and sure enough, Ammon's brothers were pulled outta that prison.
When Ammon finally saw them, his heart was heavy as a rock; they were bare as a jaybird, and their skin was raw ‘cause they’d been tied up too long. They’d been through the wringer with hunger, thirst, and all sorts of troubles, yet they stayed strong through it all.
Seems they landed in the grip of folks that were tougher than a two-dollar steak; they wouldn’t listen to a lick of sense, tossin’ Ammon’s brothers around like rag dolls, and finally had ‘em locked up in that Middoni prison, bound up snug for days, ‘til Lamoni and Ammon came to set ‘em free.
