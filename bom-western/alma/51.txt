Well now, let me rustle up them words for ya in a cowboy twist.
So it all started when them king-men wanted to wrangle up a new law and set themselves a king—Pahoran, along with the freemen, had the folks cheer’n for ‘em—Moroni gave them king-men an ultimatum; they either defend their land or meet their maker—Amalickiah and his Lamanite gang rounded up a heap of fortified towns—Teancum held the line against the Lamanites and took down Amalickiah right in his own tent. ’Twas around 67–66 B.C.
Now, it was the start of the twenty-fifth year of them judges running the Nephites, and they had struck a peace deal ‘twixt the Lehi folks and Morianton over the lay of the land, kickin’ off that twenty-fifth year on a peaceful note;
But it didn’t take long for that peace to turn into a legit squabble among the folks about chief judge Pahoran; yessiree, some folks figured it was time to change a few laws.
But Pahoran wasn’t about to budge or let 'em monkey with the law; he turned a deaf ear to them who hollered for changes.
That got those law-changin’ folks all riled up and ready to kick him out of the judge’s seat; a heated debate broke out, but thankfully it didn’t come to blows.
So them folks hankerin’ to knock Pahoran off his high horse got themselves dubbed as king-men, ‘cause they wanted to change the law to scrap the free government and crown a king.
And the folks wantin’ Pahoran to stick around as judges called themselves freemen; a division was drawn, ‘cause the freemen pledged to guard their rights and freedoms under a free government.
Then it turned out this whole ruckus got settled by the good folks’ voices. And wouldn’t ya know it, the people spoke up for the freemen, keeping Pahoran in the judgment seat, which threw a bit of a party for Pahoran and his liberty-lovin’ pals, makin’ sure the king-men knew better than to stir the pot.
Now them king-lovers were mostly folks of high birth, really wantin’ to be the big shots, and they were backed by those hungry for power over the folks.
But time was of the essence for these disputes among Nephi’s people, as Amalickiah had a fire lit under the hearts of the Lamanites, rallyin' up soldiers from all corners of his territories, loadin’ ‘em up for a showdown; he swore he’d drink Moroni’s blood.
But hold your horses; we’ll find out his big talk was as reckless as a wild steer; still, he got busy gettin’ his army ready to face the Nephites.
Now, his army wasn’t as mighty as before, 'cause plenty of ‘em had already been put down by the Nephites; but even with their heavy losses, Amalickiah managed to round up a whoppin’ big army, enough that he didn’t fear to roll into Zarahemla.
Yup, ole Amalickiah himself led the Lamanite crew down south. It was the twenty-fifth year of the reign of them judges, right when they were tryin’ to fix the squabble about chief judge Pahoran.
When them king-men caught wind of the Lamanites rustlin’ towards ‘em, they started feelin’ all warm and fuzzy inside; they refused to grab their weapons, too busy bein’ mad at the chief judge and them liberty lovers to lift a finger for their own land.
When Moroni spotted this, seein’ the Lamanites headed for their borders, he got all fired up over the stubbornness of those he’d worked so hard to protect; yep, he was filled with pure rage.
So he sent a request to the governor, talkin’ about gettin' the good folks’ backing to make those dissenters either fight for their homeland or deal with the hangman.
His top priority was to snuff out the fuss among the people; that discord had led ‘em straight to ruin. And the folks agreed to give him the go-ahead.
Then Moroni ordered his army to roll out against those king-men, to crush their pride and nobility flat, or they could take up arms and join the fight for freedom.
And forth marched the soldiers; they knocked low the pride and nobility of those king-men so hard that when they raised their weapons against Moroni’s men, they got chopped down and sent back to the ground.
In the end, four thousand of ‘em met their fate by the sword, and the leaders who survived were tossed in jail ‘cause there weren’t no time to sort ‘em out right then.
The rest of the dissenters, rather than get sliced down, raised the banner of liberty and were forced to hoist that freedom flag on their towers and in their towns, takin’ up arms to defend their own country.
So Moroni put an end to them king-men, makin' sure no one was left callin’ themselves that; he brought down the stubborn pride of those noble bloodsuckers, makin’ ‘em humble themselves alongside their kin, ready to fight bravely for their freedom from bondage.
Well, while Moroni was busy squashing the squabbles among his own peeps and settlin’ ‘em into peace and order while preparin’ for a showdown with the Lamanites, lo and behold, the Lamanites had moseyed right into Moroni’s territory, queuing up by the seashore.
Turns out, the Nephites weren’t strong enough in Moroni’s town, and Amalickiah pushed ‘em back, takin’ down a good number. Before ya knew it, he was sittin’ pretty at the city, takin’ charge of all their strongholds.
The ones who scurried outta the city of Moroni found their way to Nephihah; and the folks from Lehi gathered together, steppin’ up to prepare for a fight with the Lamanites.
But Amalickiah wasn’t about to let the Lamanites take on Nephihah just yet; he held ‘em back down by the beach, leavin’ guards in every city to hold the line.
And he kept on takin’ over a heap of cities, Nephihah, Lehi, Morianton, Omner, Gid, and Mulek, all sittin’ on the east side near the shore.
With that, the Lamanites had snagged a slew of towns thanks to Amalickiah’s trickery, gotta hand it to him; every single one fortified just like Moroni’s.
And they marched towards the Bountiful border, runnin’ the Nephites right outta dodge and stackin’ up a toll of slain.
But they ended up crossin’ paths with Teancum, who took out Morianton and led his people to safety.
He caught up to Amalickiah too, who was marchin’ forward with his massive crew to grab hold of Bountiful and those northern lands.
But that plan hit a snag when Teancum and his band drove 'em back, ‘cause they were top-notch fighters; every single one from Teancum’s crew bested the Lamanites in both might and street smarts in battle, givin’ ‘em the upper hand.
They harassed the Lamanites so good they kept takin’ ‘em down till the sun dropped low. Teancum and his boys set up camp on the Bountiful border; while Amalickiah made camp on the sandy beach, and they kept gettin’ driven back.
When night rolled around, Teancum and his sidekick slipped out under the cover of darkness, sneakin’ into Amalickiah’s camp; lo and behold, the king and his men were sound asleep, worn flat from the day’s hard work.
Teancum eased into the king’s tent and put a javelin to his chest; poof, he dropped dead without waking a single soul.
Then, Teancum slinked back to his own camp, findin' his men still snoozin'; he roused ‘em up and spilled the beans on what just went down.
He had his troops stand at the ready, just in case the Lamanites woke up and charged at ‘em.
And that wraps up the twenty-fifth year of the judges keepin’ watch over the Nephite folk; and that’s how we say farewell to Amalickiah.
