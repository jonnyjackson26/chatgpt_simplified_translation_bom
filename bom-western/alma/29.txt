O what I wouldn't give to be an angel, to swing a lasso like the voice of God, shoutin’ repentance till the ground shakes, callin’ every soul to turn their ways!
You bet, I'd holler to every man and woman, like a clap of thunder, about turnin’ their backs on sin and the fine plan of redemption, urge ‘em to come back to our God, so there ain't no more heartache across this here land.
But here I am, just a man, wrestlin' with my own sins; I reckon I should be satisfied with the hand the Good Lord's dealt me.
I best not stir up trouble with my wishes against the firm word of a fair God, 'cause I know He gives folks what they long for, be it death or life; indeed, He lays down unchangeable rules, friendly-like, according to folks’ will, regardless if it’s for good or ruin.
Yep, I’m certain that good and bad come knockin’ at everyone’s door; them that don’t grasp the difference are off the hook, but them that do have to reckon with their desires, whether they long for good or bad, life or the sting of regret.
Now, since I’ve pieced all this together, what’s got me itchin’ for more than just doin’ the work the Lord’s pointed me to?
Why would I wanna be an angel, when I could be spreadin’ God’s word to every corner of this here earth?
‘Cause looky here, the Lord’s got a plan for folks from every nation and tongue to share His message, filled with wisdom, givin’ ‘em just what they need; seein’ it clear as day that the Lord gives out guidance with fairness and truth.
I know what the Lord's laid down for me, and I take pride in it. Ain’t about me, though; I take pride in what the Lord's asked of me; yep, and my true glory is maybe bein’ an instrument in the big man’s hands to lead just one soul back to repentance; that’s where my joy lies.
And when I spot my brothers truly turnin’ to the Lord, my heart swells with joy; I remember what the Lord's done for me, how He listened to my prayers; oh yes, I recall His kind hand stretchin’ out to save me.
Sure ’nuff, I also think on the trials my kin faced; I know the Lord freed ‘em from their bonds, and through that, He set up His church; that same Lord, the Almighty of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, got ‘em out of trouble.
Ain’t never forgot how my fathers were captive; that same God who removed ‘em from the clutches of the Egyptians didn’t leave ‘em hangin’ in hardships.
Yep, that same God built His church among ‘em; that same God’s called me by a holy command to share His word with this folks, givin’ me a heap of success, which fills my heart to the brim.
But I ain’t just celebratin’ my own wins; my happiness grows deeper ‘cause of my brethren’s success, them who’ve ridden up to the land of Nephi.
Look here, they’ve worked their tails off and reaped a bountiful harvest; their reward's gonna be somethin’ to behold!
Now, when I ponder on their triumphs, I feel my spirit liftin’ right up, almost leavin’ this world, 'cause my joy’s that grand.
And here’s hopin’ the Good Lord lets these my brothers settle down in His kingdom; and all those who’re the fruits of their hard labor, may they never wander off again, but praise Him forevermore. And may the Good Lord see it done just like I’ve said. Amen.
