Well now, it happened that in the first part of the fifth year of their ruling, folks started raisin' a ruckus; seein' as there was this fella named Amlici, a real sly coyote, sure as shootin' he was wise in the ways of the world, much like that scoundrel who took down Gideon with a blade, who got his just due under the law—
So, this Amlici, with his tricky ways, managed to rustle up quite a few folks to follow him; he gathered ‘round a powerful bunch, and they set their sights on makin’ Amlici the king of the whole shebang.
Now, this here news sent shivers down the spines of the church folks and them who hadn’t been hoodwinked by Amlici’s sweet talk; they knew good and well that the rules stated such matters had to be settled by the folks’ voice.
So, it was if Amlici played his cards right and got the people’s say-so, he being a notorious varmint, would rob ‘em of their rights and whatnot in the church, ‘cause he aimed to wipe out God’s folks.
Then the people huddled together across the land, each feller thinkin’ his own thoughts, whether they were for or against Amlici, hitchin’ up in separate groups, arguin’ and hollerin’ something fierce.
And they congregated to throw in their votes ‘bout the situation, which were laid before the judges for countin’.
Sure enough, when the folks spoke, they said a big NO to Amlici bein' crowned as king.
This made them who opposed him mighty happy; but Amlici got his faithful followers fired up, spittin’ mad at those who didn’t stand with him.
Then it happened that the folks rallied and made Amlici their king, goin’ right ahead with their plans.
When Amlici took the reins, he barked orders for his folks to grab their guns and arms against their kin; just to make sure they bowed down to him.
Now the gang under Amlici took on his name, callin’ themselves the Amlicites, while the rest still held to the name Nephites, bein’ the good God-fearin’ folk.
So the Nephites knew well the mischief Amlicites were lookin’ to stir up, and they got themselves ready; armed with swords, cimeters, bows, arrows, stones, slings, you name it—every kind of weapon they could muster.
Thus, they stood ready to face the Amlicites when the time came. They appointed captains, higher-ups, and chief leads, all based on how many they had.
And Amlici, too, got his crew outfitted with every kind of war gear you could think of, handpicked rulers and leaders to ride out to war against their brethren.
Soon enough, the Amlicites rolled up on the hill Amnihu, east of the river Sidon, by the land of Zarahemla, and there they started throwin’ lead with the Nephites.
Now Alma, bein’ the chief judge and the head hombre of the Nephite folk, saddled up with his people, and with his captains and chief captains, led his army against the Amlicites for a good ol' scrap.
They started takin’ down the Amlicites on that eastern hill of Sidon. The Amlicites put up a fierce fight, so much so that quite a few Nephites fell before them.
But the Lord was workin’ in favor of the Nephites, givin’ ‘em the strength to slay the Amlicites good and proper, makin’ ‘em skedaddle.
And so it went that the Nephites chased the Amlicites all day long, knockin' ‘em off left and right till they sent twelve thousand five hundred thirty-two of 'em to the great beyond, while the Nephite losses tallied up to six thousand five hundred sixty-two.
When Alma could chase the Amlicites no longer, he called for a rest and set up camp in the valley of Gideon, named after that Gideon who met his end at the hands of Nehor; and right there in that valley, the Nephites raised their tents for the night.
Alma dispatched spies to shadow the Amlicites’ remnant, tryin’ to get a bead on their plans and schemes, hopin' to protect his folk from bein’ wiped out.
Them that Alma sent to keep an eye on the Amlicite camp were Zeram, Amnor, Manti, and Limher; them's the fellas who went out with their boys to keep watch.
On the next mornin’, they came rushin’ back into the Nephite camp, wearin' high alarm and fear written all over their faces, sayin’:
"Listen up, we trailed the Amlicite camp, and lo and behold, by the land of Minon, above Zarahemla, down the path of Nephi, we spotted a whole mess o’ Lamanites; and guess what? The Amlicites have teamed up with ‘em!
“They're goin’ right after our folks in that land; they’re runnin’ off with their livestock, wives, and kiddos, heading towards our town! If we don’t hustle, they'll take over our city, and our people will be slain!"
So the Nephites quickly packed up their tents and made tracks outta the valley of Gideon toward their city, which was named Zarahemla.
But lo and behold, as they crossed the river Sidon, the Lamanites and Amlicites, lookin' as numerous as the grains of sand along the sea, came bearin’ down on them to wipe 'em out.
Yet, the Nephites found strength from the Lord, prayin’ hard for deliverance from their foes, and sure enough, the Lord heard their cries, lendin' ‘em strength, while the Lamanites and Amlicites fell before ‘em.
Then came the moment where Alma squared off with Amlici, sword in hand, standin’ toe-to-toe, givin’ it their all.
When Alma called upon the Lord in a mighty shout, beggin’ for mercy and strength to be an instrument for savin’ his people.
Once he'd said those words, he dove back into battle with Amlici, feelin’ fired up enough to take Amlici down with a sword strike.
Now Alma also tussled with the king of the Lamanites; but that king turned tail and ran from Alma, sendin’ his guards to take him on instead.
But Alma, with his guards, threw down with the king’s men until he sent ‘em packing.
And he cleared the ground, or rather the bank on the west of the river Sidon, sendin' the bodies of the slain Lamanites floatin’ down the river, givin’ his folk room to cross and take on the Lamanites and Amlicites over yonder.
When they’d all crossed the river Sidon, the Lamanites and Amlicites lit outta there faster than a jackrabbit, even though they were more than a few.
They bolted towards the wilderness, west and north, far beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites gave chase, takin’ ‘em down left and right.
Sure enough, they were met from all directions, takin’ hits and bein’ driven till they scattered off to the west and north, until they reached the wildlands, known as Hermounts; that there piece of wilderness was home to wild and hungry critters.
It turned out that a heap of ‘em died in the wilderness from their wounds, gettin’ gobbled up by those beasts and the vultures overhead; and their bones are found, cluttered all over the ground.
