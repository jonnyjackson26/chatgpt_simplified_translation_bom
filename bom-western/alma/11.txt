Well now, gather 'round, partner, 'cause I’m fixin' to tell ya about how the Nephite way of money works. Back in them days, if you were a judge under the law laid down by ol' Mosiah, you got paid for the hours you put in settlin' disputes.
If a feller owed another and wouldn't cough up the cash, folks would take it to the judge; the judge, bein' the lawman he was, sent out his deputies to haul the sorry scoundrel before him. He'd weigh the evidence and decide if the feller had to pay up or get hisself stripped down or kicked out like a common thief.
Now, the judge earned his keep a senine of gold for a day's work, or a senum of silver which equaled that gold, per the law that had been laid down.
These here are the names of the different chunks of gold and silver they had, all sittin' in line by their value. The Nephites did it their own way, not like those folks in Jerusalem; they made up their own reckonin' and measurements to suit the times and troubles of the people, right up until the judges took charge under King Mosiah.
So here’s how they counted their gold: a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.
And then you had your senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.
A senum of silver was worth the same as a senine of gold, and either could buy you a measure of barley or any type of grain.
A seon of gold was worth double a senine.
And a shum of gold was worth twice what a seon was.
A limnah of gold, now, that one was worth them all rolled into one.
An amnor of silver was as valuable as twicetwo senums.
An ezrom of silver was worth four senums.
And an onti? Well, that bad boy was the richest of the bunch.
Now, if we’re talkin' about smaller numbers, here’s the scoop—
A shiblon is half of a senum; so that's one shiblon for half a measure of barley.
A shiblum is half of a shiblon.
And a leah is half of a shiblum.
That’s how they counted things, just like that.
An antion of gold is worth three shiblons.
Now, seein' as they were all about makin' a buck, they kept the folks as stirred up as a hornet's nest so they'd have plenty of work, kindlin' all sorts of ruckus and mischief to rake in more cash for the cases that came before 'em—this got 'em riled up against Alma and Amulek.
Then Zeezrom, he began to poke at Amulek, askin’: “Will ya answer a few questions I'm fixin’ to toss at ya?” Zeezrom was a sly dog, knowin' all the devil’s tricks to mess up what was good, so he asked Amulek if he’d answer his queries.
And Amulek replied, “Yup, if it’s in line with the Spirit of the Lord in me, ‘cause I ain't sayin' nothin' that goes against it.” Zeezrom then dangled six onties of silver in front of him, sayin’ he’d give ‘em if Amulek would say there’s no Supreme Being.
Amulek shot back, “Oh you child of the devil, why are ya temptin’ me? Don’t ya know the righteous don’t give in to that kind of shenanigans?”
“Ya don’t believe there’s a God, do ya?” I tell ya, Amulek insisted, “Nay, you know there’s a God, but you’re more keen on that shiny coin than Him.”
And now you’ve lied before God and me, Zeezrom. You said you’d give me them six onties—well, you wanted to keep ‘em for yourself and had your heart set on me denyin’ the true and livin' God so you could bring me down. So guess what, you’re gonna get a real good payback for such wickedness.
Zeezrom shot back, “So you’re sayin’ there’s a true and livin’ God?”
And Amulek responded, “Yep, there's a true and livin’ God.”
Then Zeezrom asked, “Is there more than one God?”
And Amulek said, “No.”
Zeezrom tried again, “How do ya know all this?”
Amulek answered, “An angel brought that knowledge to me.”
Then Zeezrom went on, “Who’s comin’? Is it the Son of God?”
And Amulek replied, “You bet it is.”
Then Zeezrom came back at him, “Is He gonna save folks in their sins?” Amulek fired back, “No way, ‘cause it ain’t in Him to go against His word.”
Zeezrom turned to the folks and said, “Ya hear that? He claims there’s only one God, yet also says the Son of God is comin', but He won’t save folks in their sins, actin' like he can tell God what to do.”
Then Amulek said, “Hold on now, you’ve got it all wrong—I never said that I had the right to tell God what to do, just that He can’t save folks in their sins.”
I’ll say it again, He can’t save you in your sins, ‘cause He made it clear that no unclean thing can enter the kingdom of heaven. So how can ya expect to be saved if you ain’t got a ticket to heaven?
Then Zeezrom sprang another question, “Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?”
Amulek replied, “Yep, He’s the very Father of heaven and earth and everything in ‘em; He’s the start and the finish, the first and the last.”
He’s gonna come to this world to save His people; He’ll carry the sins of folks who believe in His name, and they’re the ones who get eternal life—ain’t no salvation for nobody else.
So the wicked will stay just as they are, like no chance of redemption ever happened, ‘cept for bein’ freed from the bonds of death. For a day will come when all shall rise from the grave and stand before God, judged by their deeds.
Now, there’s a death they call a temporal death, and the death of Christ will loose those bonds so everyone can rise from that death.
The spirit and the body will reunite in perfect form; every limb and joint will be put back together, just like we are now; and we’ll stand before God, knowin’ just like we do now, recallin’ all our wrongs with perfect clarity.
Now, this restoration ain't just for some—it's for everyone, old and young, free and bond, male and female, the wicked and the righteous; not even a hair will be lost, but every last thing will go back to its right shape, just as it is now, and each will stand before the bar of Christ, the Son, and God the Father, with the Holy Spirit, who all make up the one Eternal God, to be judged for their actions, good or bad.
Now listen close, I’ve talked to ya about the death of the mortal flesh, and also told you about the resurrection of that flesh. I tell ya this: this mortal flesh will be raised to an immortal form, from death—the first death to life—so they won't die again; their spirits will unite with their bodies, never to part again; thus the whole thing becomes spiritual and immortal, never to spoil again.
When Amulek finished his talk, folks began to be amazed all over again, and Zeezrom had the shivers. And that wraps up Amulek’s words, or at least what I’ve managed to jot down.
