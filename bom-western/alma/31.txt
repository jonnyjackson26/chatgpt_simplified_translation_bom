So it happened that after the whole hullabaloo with Korihor, Alma caught wind that them Zoramites were leadin’ folks astray, and Zoram, their head honcho, was causin’ folks to bow down to lifeless idols. This made Alma’s heart feel mighty low 'cause of all the wrongful ways of the people.
It sure was a heavy load for Alma to bear knowin' how far his folks had wandered off the straight and narrow; his heart felt real grieved thinkin’ about the Zoramites breakin’ godly ties with the Nephites.
Now them Zoramites had corralled themselves in a place called Antionum, sittin’ to the east of Zarahemla land, not far from the seashore, just south of Jershon, which was right against them wild lands filled with Lamanites.
Them Nephites were shakin’ in their boots, worried that the Zoramites might start chattin’ with the Lamanites, and they figured that could lead to a heap of trouble for the Nephites.
With the good word preachin’ havin’ a way of nudgin’ folks to do what’s right—heck, it had more punch in their minds than guns or other gear ever could—Alma decided it’d be wise to give the good book a shot.
So he took along Ammon, Aaron, and Omner; leavin' Himni back at the church in Zarahemla. He gathered his three amigos and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were busy in Melek; plus he brought two of his sons along.
Now his oldest boy, Helaman, didn’t saddle up with 'em, but he took Shiblon and Corianton, and that’s the bunch that rode out to preach the good word to them Zoramites.
The Zoramites, bein’ a bit rebellious against the Nephite ways, had already heard the good stories from God.
But them folks had fallen into all kinds of mischief, 'cause they wouldn’t keep to God’s commandments, nor his guidelines like the law of Moses told 'em to.
And they didn’t bother to keep up with church practices, like prayin’ and callin’ on God daily, so they wouldn’t get caught in temptations.
Mighty plenty did they twist up the good ways of the Lord, so Alma and his crew set out to preach to 'em and set things straight.
Well, when they rolled into town, they were struck dumb to see the Zoramites had built themselves some fancy synagogues, gatherin’ together one day a week they called the day of the Lord, worshippin’ in a way that Alma and his gang had never laid eyes on.
They had themselves a special spot right in the middle of the synagogue, real high up off the ground, where only one soul at a time could stand.
So whosoever wanted to worship had to climb up there, stretch his hands skyward, and holler with all his heart, sayin’:
Holy, holy God; we reckon you’re the real thing, and you’re holy, and you were a spirit, still are a spirit, and you’ll be a spirit forever.
Holy God, we reckon you’ve set us apart from our kin; we ain’t buyin’ the tales our folks passed down from their foolish ways; we believe you’ve picked us to be your holy young ’uns; and you let us know there won’t be no Christ.
But you’re the same yesterday, today, and forever; you’ve elected us for salvation, while every other soul around us is set to face your wrath down in hell; for this holiness, O God, we tip our hats to you; and we’re mighty grateful that you’ve chosen us, so we won’t be led astray by our brethren’s crazy traditions, which tie 'em up in disbelief of Christ, makin' their hearts wander far from you, our God.
And again we thank you, O God, for makin’ us a chosen and holy people. Amen.
So it happened that after Alma and his crew plus his boys heard these prayers, they were flabbergasted beyond belief.
‘Cause, every last man stepped up and offered up the very same prayers.
Now they named that place Rameumptom, which means the holy stand.
From that stand, every man raised the same prayer to God, givin’ thanks that they were chosen by him, and that he didn’t lead them astray like their brethren, and that their hearts weren’t swayed to believe in things to come, which none of 'em understood.
Once everyone had thanked God in that way, they rode back home, not a peep about their God ‘til they all gathered up again to that holy stand to give thanks once more.
When Alma saw this happening, his heart was heavy; 'cause it looked to him like they were a wicked bunch; he could see their hearts were set on gold, silver, and all sorts of fancy goods.
Yep, he saw their hearts swelled up in braggin’, all wrapped up in pride.
He raised his voice to the heavens and cried out: O Lord, how long will you let your humble servants stew down here in this flesh, watchin’ such rank wickedness among the folks?
Look here, O God, they’re callin’ on you, yet their hearts are stuffed with pride. Behold, O God, they’re calling out with their mouths while they strut around puffed up by the worthless things of this world.
Check it out, O my God, their flashy clothes, fancy hairdos, shiny bracelets, golden trinkets, and all the precious things they deck themselves with; yet their hearts are set on all that, and they’re calling out to you, sayin’—We thank you, O God, ‘cause we’re a chosen lot while others stand to perish.
Yep, and they’re claimin’ you told 'em there won’t be no Christ.
O Lord God, how long are you gonna let this wickedness and disbelief run wild among these people? O Lord, grant me strength to endure my feebleness. ‘Cause I’m weak, and this sin among these folks just tears at my soul.
O Lord, my heart’s mighty troubled; give my soul some comfort in Christ. O Lord, let me find strength to bear with patience these hardships that’ll come upon me ‘cause of this sorry lot.
O Lord, grant comfort to my soul, and success for me and my fellow workers—sure, Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Amulek, Zeezrom, and my two boys—yeah, all of ‘em, let ‘em find comfort in you, O Lord. Yep, give a little comfort to their souls in Christ.
Let ‘em find strength to endure whatever trials come their way ‘cause of this people’s sins.
O Lord, let it be that we find success in bringin’ them back to you in Christ.
Look out, O Lord, them souls are precious, and a whole heap of ‘em are our kin; so please, grant us, O Lord, the power and wisdom to lead our brethren back to you.
So it was that after Alma spoke these words, he clapped his hands on everyone with him. And lo and behold, when he clapped his hands on ‘em, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
After that, they kinda went their separate ways without frettin’ about what they should fill their bellies with, or what they should drink, or what to wear.
And the Lord looked after ‘em, made sure they weren’t hungry or thirsty; yes sir, and he also gave ‘em strength so they wouldn’t suffer any sort of burdens, 'cept those were all swallowed up in the joy of Christ. This was all in line with Alma’s prayer, 'cause he was prayin’ with good faith.
