Well now, after Alma wrapped up his talkin' with the folks at the church over in Zarahemla, he went ahead and set up some priests and elders, givin’ ‘em the ol’ hands-on ordination just like the Big Guy intended, to keep an eye on things and steer the church right.
If’n anyone who weren’t part of the church had a change of heart and turned away from their wrongdoings, they sure got dunked in the river to wash away their sins and were welcomed into the fold.
But if’n you were part of the church and you didn’t humble yerself and fess up to your mischief—those who were all puffed up with pride—well, they were shown the door, and their names were erased from the list of the good folks.
So that’s how they started puttin’ the church’s ways in order down there in Zarahemla.
Now I reckon y’all ought to know that the good word from God was meant for everybody, and there weren’t no one left outta the chance to gather ‘round and hear it preached.
Still, folks were told they best get together often, joinin’ in some serious prayer and fasting for the souls who hadn’t yet found their way to God.
Well, it happened that after Alma set these rules in place, he packed his bags and skedaddled on over to the east side of the Sidon River, into Gideon Valley, where there was a town built and named after the man who got himself cut down by Nehor’s sword.
Alma rode on into the valley of Gideon and started preachin’ the good word to the church that had been set up there, followin’ the revelations and traditions passed down from his folks, powered by the spirit of prophecy in him, all about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was comin’ to save folks from their sins, and the holy callin’ he had. And that’s how the story goes. Amen.
