Well, it happened in the eleventh year when them judges were keepin' order over the good folks of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, that there'd been a heap of peace in the land of Zarahemla, no ruckus nor feudin' for a good spell, 'til on that fifth day, a mighty shout of war echoed across the land.
Y'see, them Lamanites rode in from the wilds, breaching the borders and settin' their sights on the town of Ammonihah, startin' to wipe out the folks and lay waste to the city.
Now, before the Nephites could rustle up enough good hands to send 'em packin', they had already taken care of the townsfolk in Ammonihah and snatched up some others loiterin' round the borders of Noah, takin' 'em off into the wild.
The Nephites, they were mighty keen to track down their kin who’d been hauled off into the wilderness.
So, the chief captain they had for the Nephite army—name of Zoram, and he had two young'uns, Lehi and Aha—now Zoram and his boys figured if Alma was the high priest and had the spirit of prophecy, they oughta ride up to him and see what the good Lord had in mind for findin' their folk who got snatched by the Lamanites.
And it happened that Alma asked the Lord what the deal was. He came back to ‘em and said: "Listen up, the Lamanites are fixin' to cross the river Sidon down south, well past Manti. That’s where you’ll catch ‘em, east of the Sidon River, and the Lord will hand over your kin they’ve taken captive."
So, Zoram and his boys, with their troops, crossed that river Sidon and rode beyond the borders of Manti into the wild south, on the eastern side of that river.
They came upon them Lamanite armies, and those scoundrels got scattered and hightailed it into the wild; they grabbed their folks who’d been snatched away, and not a single one of ‘em was lost. They brought 'em back home to their own lands.
And that there wrapped up the eleventh year of the judges, with them Lamanites bein' driven outta the land, and the town of Ammonihah meetin' its end; every last one of those Ammonihahites got wiped out, along with their grand old city, which they swore couldn’t be touched by the Almighty due to its size.
But lo and behold, in just one day, it was left in ruins; carcasses were torn up by dogs and wild critters of the plains.
After many days rolled by, their bodies piled up like debris on the ground, only covered by a thin layer of dirt. The stench was so foul that folks wouldn’t even step foot in Ammonihah for a spell. They came to call it the Desolation of Nehors, for the fallen folks were all of Nehor's lot, and their lands lay desolate.
The Lamanites didn’t come back for a scrap against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of them judges holdin' sway over the Nephites. So, for three whole years, the good people of Nephi enjoyed peace all around.
Alma and Amulek hit the trail preachin’ repentance to the folks in their temples, sanctuaries, and synagogues, built up like the Jews did.
And anyone who’d lend an ear, they shared the good word without favoritism, day in and day out.
So Alma and Amulek kept on wanderin' forth along with a passel of others chosen for the task, spreadin’ the good word far and wide. The church really took root in that land, havin’ a general presence across the territory, among all the Nephite folks.
There wasn’t no inequality among 'em; the Lord poured out His spirit all over the land, settin’ the minds of the folks right, preparin’ their hearts to take in the teachin’ that was comin’ when the time came—
So they wouldn’t harden their hearts against the word, nor fall into doubt and ruin, but instead take the message with joy, gettin' grafted like branches into the true vine, and findin' rest in the Lord, their God.
Now those priests who went among the folks preached against all them lies, deceits, envies, strifes, malice, revilings, and every manner of thievery, shootin’ straight that this kind of mess just ain’t right—
Preachin’ about what’s comin’ up real soon; yes, touslin’ about the arrival of the Son of God, his sufferin’ and death, and also the rise of the dead.
Many folks got curious ‘bout where the Son of God would show up; they were taught he’d make an appearance after his resurrection, and the folks took that news with great joy and gladness.
And now after the church had really settled in all around—having bested the devil, with the word of God bein’ preached clean across the territory, and the Lord rainin’ down blessings on the people—thus wrapped up the fourteenth year of the reign of them judges over the Nephites.
