In the Resurrection, folks either ride out into a never-ending happiness or get thrown into endless misery—Wickedness never led to no happiness—Carnal men are out in this world without God—you see, every soul gets back what it picked up while they were breathing this earthly air. 'Bout 74 B.C.
Now, listen up, my boy, I got somethin’ to say 'bout that restoration we've been chattin’ about; 'cause some folks done twisted the good book and strayed way off the path 'cause of it. I can see your mind's been all tangled up with this too. But just hang on, I'm gonna break it down for ya.
I reckon, my son, that the plan of restoration fits right in with God’s sense of justice; it’s only fair that all things be put back in their rightful place. Just take a gander—it's just and right, what with Christ’s power and resurrection, that a man’s soul gets reunited with its body, and every bit of that body gets put back together proper.
And it sure is just in God’s eyes for folks to be judged by what they do; if their deeds were good in this life, and their hearts aimed for good, then come the last day, they ought to be brought back to what's good.
But if they got up to no good, then they'll be facing the music for their wicked ways. So all things will be set right, everything back to how it should be—mortality turned into immortality, corruption into incorruption—rising up to endless joy to inherit God’s kingdom, or sinking into endless sorrow in the devil's territory, one way or the other.
One'll be raised to joy, according to what he's wanted, or good 'cause that’s what he longed for; while the other'll end up in misery, 'cause that’s where his heart led him; just like a coyote howlin’ at the moon, if a fella’s been chasing after sin all day long, well, that’s just the kind of reward he’ll get when night rolls around.
And it’s the same story on the flip side. If he’s turned his back on his wrongdoings and aims for righteousness till the cows come home, then he’ll surely find his reward waiting for 'im.
These are the good folks who’ve been saved by the Lord; yep, they’re the ones pulled outta that endless dark night; and here they be, standin’ or fallin’, 'cause really, they’re their own judges—the choice to do good or do bad is in their hands.
Now, God’s decrees ain't no flimsy things; they're set in stone, and the way’s been made clear for anyone who’s willing to take the leap and find salvation.
And now, my son, don’t go riskin’ another gaffe ‘gainst your God on these here doctrines you’ve been teeterin’ on, playin’ fast and loose with sin.
Don’t go thinkin’ 'cause we’re talkin’ 'bout restoration that you can wriggle free from sin to happiness. Let me tell ya, wickedness ain't never brought no happiness.
And now, my boy, all folks just a-runnin’ wild, or I’d say, in a carnal mess, are stuck in the bitterness and tangled up in sin; they’re wanderin’ this world without God, and they’ve gone against the very nature of God; that’s why they ain't findin’ no true happiness.
Now, reckon the word restoration means takin’ somethin’ natural and puttin’ it in an unnatural state, or twistin’ it into something it ain't?
Oh, my son, that just ain't so; the word restoration means bringin’ back evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish—good for good; righteous for righteous; just for just; merciful for merciful.
So, my son, make sure you’re showin’ mercy to your fellow man; be fair, judge rightly, and do good all the time; if you keep at it, then your rewards’ll be plenty; you’ll get mercy back, justice back, righteous judgment back, and good will come back to you.
'Cause all that you send out will circle right back around; so the word restoration really puts the squeeze on the sinner and don’t let ‘em off the hook one bit.
