Well, it happened in the start of the thirty-sixth year since them judges took the reins over the folks of Nephi, that Shiblon got his hands on them sacred records what Helaman had received from Alma.
He was a fair-minded fella, walked straight with the Good Lord; he made sure to do the right thing all the time, kept the commandments of the Lord his God; his brother was in the same boat.
Then it came to be that Moroni passed on to the great beyond. And that wrapped up the thirty-sixth year of the judges’ rule.
Come the thirty-seventh year of them judges, a mighty fine bunch of folks, ‘round five thousand four hundred strong, along with their wives and kids, took off from the land of Zarahemla, headin’ northward.
Now Hagoth, bein’ a real curious sort, he went ahead and built himself a big ol’ ship right on the edge of Bountiful by the land Desolation, then sent it sailin’ out into the west sea, through that narrow neck leadin’ to the north.
Sure enough, plenty of Nephites climbed aboard, loaded up with provisions, along with many women and children; they set their sights northward. And that marked the end of the thirty-seventh year.
Then in the thirty-eighth year, this fella went and built some more ships. The first ship came back, and a heap more folks climbed on board; they loaded up on provisions again and took off for the north once more.
And wouldn’t ya know it, they never did come back. We reckon they must’ve drowned down in the depth of the sea. Also, one more ship took off, but where it went, we ain’t got a clue.
In that year, a whole lot of people headed out to the land northward. And thus wrapped up the thirty-eighth year.
Now in the thirty-ninth year of them judges, Shiblon kicked the bucket too, and Corianton headed out on a ship northward to bring supplies to the folks who had already ventured that way.
So, it made sense for Shiblon to hand over them sacred records to the son of Helaman, who shared his father's name of Helaman.
Now hold your horses, all those carvings in Helaman’s hands were distributed out among the good folks across the land, ‘cept for the parts Alma had ordered not to be shared.
But still, those things had to be held sacred and passed down from one generation to the next; that year, they made their way to Helaman, just 'fore Shiblon met his maker.
It also happened that year, some discontented souls rode out to join the Lamanites; they got real riled up again against the Nephites.
And in the same year, they rolled down with a big army lookin’ to fight the people of Moronihah, or the Moronihah army, but they were bested and sent packin’ back to their ground, takin’ a heavy loss with 'em.
And that wrapped up the thirty-ninth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites.
So, that’s the tale of Alma, his son Helaman, and Shiblon, who was also his son.
