Well, partner, here’s my take on those verses, rephrased in some cowboy lingo:
The ramblings of Alma that he hollered out to the folks in Gideon, scribbled down by his own hand.
Comprising chapter 7.
Now listen up, my good buddies, since I got the chance to ride on over to y’all, I’m fixin’ to share my words with ya; yep, coming right from my own mouth, seein' as this is the first time I’ve shot the breeze with you in this way, I’ve been stuck sittin’ on the judgment throne with a heap of responsibilities that kept me from you.
Truth is, I wouldn’t have made it here today if it weren’t for someone else sittin’ in my place, and the good Lord, in His mercy, allowed me to come visit with you.
And looky here, I rolled in here hopin' and wishin' I’d find y’all humbled before God, still regularly askin’ for His grace, hopin’ I’d find ya pure in his sight, not in that awful pickle our buddies are in over at Zarahemla.
But praise the Lord, I’m mighty glad to know, indeed, it brings me a heap of joy to find out they’ve found their way back to doin’ right by Him.
And I reckon, with the Spirit of God in me, I’ll also feel joy over y’all; still, I sure don’t want my happiness about you to stem from all the heartache and sorrow I’ve felt for my brethren over at Zarahemla, ‘cause let me tell you, my joy with them came after plowing through a lot of troubles and heartaches.
But I’m hopin’ y’all ain’t in the state of disbelief that your kin are in; I’m hopin’ y’all ain’t puffed up with pride in your hearts; sure do hope you haven’t set your mind on riches and all them shiny trinkets of this world; I’m betting y’all don't worship no idols, but are worshippin’ the true and livin’ God, lookin’ forward to the forgiveness of your sins, with faith that lasts forever.
For I’m tellin’ you, there’s a pile of things comin' down the pike; but listen up, one thing is more important than all them—there ain’t much time left ‘til the Redeemer rides in and mingles with His folks.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not sayin' He’ll show up while He’s takin’ up space in His mortal body; the Spirit hasn’t tipped me off about that. Now, as for this matter, I ain't sure; but one thing I know for certain is the Lord God can do anything that lines up with His word.
But lo and behold, the Spirit’s shared this much with me, sayin’: Shout to this crowd, tell ‘em—Repent y’all, and get ready for the Lord, and walk in His straight paths; ‘cause the kingdom of heaven’s just around the bend, and the Son of God’s comin’ real soon.
Now check it, He’s gonna be born of Mary in good ol’ Jerusalem, the land of our ancestors, she bein’ a pure, chosen gal who'll be overshadowed and will conceive by the Holy Ghost, bringin’ forth a son, yep, the Son of God.
And He will ride out sufferin’ pains, afflictions, and all sorts of temptations; this to fulfill the promise that says He’ll take on the pains and illnesses of His folks.
And He’ll take on death so He can break the chains that hold His people down; He’ll carry their weaknesses, fillin’ His heart with mercy, so He knows how to help His folks with their troubles.
Now the Spirit knows everything; but the Son of God will suffer in the flesh so He can bear the sins of His buddies and wipe away their wrongdoings by His power to save; and this is my witness.
Now I’m tellin’ ya, you gotta repent and be born again; the Spirit says if ya ain’t reborn, you won’t inherit the heaven’s glory; so come on over and get baptized for forgiveness, washin’ those sins off, puttin’ your faith in the Lamb of God, who wipes away the sins of the world, who’s strong enough to save and clean you up right.
Yep, I’m tellin’ ya, come on, don’t be scared, and shed every sin that trips you up and drags you down into destruction, come on out and show God you’re ready to repent of your misdeeds and make a promise to keep His commandments, givin' witness of it right here and now by takin’ the plunge into the waters of baptism.
And whoever does this, and keeps God’s commandments from then on, will sure remember what I’m sayin’, yep, he will bear in mind what I’ve shared, and he’ll have eternal life, via the Spirit testifyin' in me.
Now, my dear friends, do you believe what I’m sayin’? Look here, I know you believe it; and how do I know? It’s ‘cause of the Spirit that’s bustin’ out inside me. And since your faith is solid in this, regarding the things I’ve mentioned, my joy is great.
As I told ya from the get-go, I really wanted to see you, not stuck in that tight spot like your brethren; well, I’m feelin’ like my wishes have come true.
I reckon you’re walkin’ down the right trails; I see you’re hittin’ the path that leads to God’s kingdom; yep, I notice you’re makin’ His paths straight.
I see it’s been shown to you, through the truth of His word, that He won’t be wanderin’ down crooked trails; He don’t change one bit from what He’s said; He don’t even cast a shadow from right to left or from the right way to the wrong way; so His path is a circle that goes on forever.
And He don’t hang around in no unholy places; no way can filthiness or anything dirty enter God’s kingdom; so I’m tellin’ ya, the day will come, sure enough, at the end of days, that anyone who’s filthy will stay in their filth.
And now, my dear friends, I’ve shared these thoughts with ya to wake you up to your duties before God, that you may walk blameless in His sight, that you may follow the holy order of God, which you’ve been given.
And I want you to be humble, gentle, and easy to deal with; brimming with patience and long-suffering; keepin’ a steady hand in everything; workin' hard to follow God’s commandments all the time; askin’ for anything you need, spiritually and temporally; and always givin’ thanks to God for whatever comes your way.
And make sure ya have faith, hope, and charity, and you’ll be overflowing with good deeds all the time.
And may the Lord bless ya, keepin’ your clothes clean and tidy, that you may finally sit down with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all those holy prophets from way back when, wearin’ your spotless garments, just like theirs, in the kingdom of heaven where you won’t have to wander again.
And now, my dear friends, I’ve shared these words with you according to the Spirit in me; and my soul is downright joyous because of all the attention and care you’ve given to my words.
And now, may God’s peace rest on ya, on your homes and land, on your critters and cattle, and all that you own, your women and your young'uns, based on your faith and good deeds, from now and forevermore. And that’s my say. Amen.
