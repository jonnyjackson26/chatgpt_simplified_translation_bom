Well now, my boy Helaman, I reckon it's high time you take hold of them records I've been keepin' safe.
And I’m tellin’ you to jot down the happenings of this here folk on the plates of Nephi, keepin’ it all close to your heart, like I’ve been doin’, ‘cause there’s a reason for holdin’ onto 'em.
Now these brass plates, filled with engravings and the holy scriptures, are like a family tree stretchin’ all the way back to our great-great-great granddaddies—
Looky here, our forebears prophesied that these needed passin' down through the ages, kept safe by the Lord till they shine light to every nation, kin, language, and folk, lettin’ ‘em know the mysteries tucked away in there.
And you see, if these plates stay stored up right, they’ll keep all their shine; yep, they'll stay bright as the sun, ‘specially them plates writin’ down the good word.
You might think I’m just blowin’ smoke here, but let me tell ya, it's them little, simple things that ‘ll bring about big changes; some small actions can turn the wise folks on their heads.
The Good Lord don’t sit idle; He works through ordinary means to bring about His grand designs; even the tiniest things can baffle the wise and save a whole heap of souls.
Now, till now I reckon it was a wise move from God to keep all this safe; 'cause it opened the eyes of many folk, showed 'em their follies, and brought 'em to knowin’ their God for the salvation of their souls.
Sure as shootin’, without the words penned in these records there’s no way Ammon and his kin could have turned so many Lamanites from the false ways of their forefathers; these records helped them find repentance, leading ‘em to the Lord their God and makes ‘em dance with joy ‘cause of Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
And who knows, maybe these records will help bring a pile of ‘em, and even our stubborn Nephite folks, hardenin’ their hearts ‘gainst sin and wrong, to know their Redeemer?
Now, I confess, I ain’t got the full picture of these mysteries yet, so for now, I’ll hold my horses.
But I can tell you this: they’re kept for a good reason, one only God knows; His counsel is wise, His paths are straight, and His works go ‘round in a perfect circle.
So remember, my boy Helaman, just how strict the commandments of God are. If ya stick to ‘em, you’ll prosper in this land—but slip up, and you’ll find yourself on the outside lookin’ in.
And don’t forget, son, God’s handed you these sacred things that’ve been kept safe for a purpose, to show His might to those who come after us.
And let me be clear, if you go breakin’ them commandments, these sacred things will be snatched away by the power of God, leavin’ ya to the devil’s whims just like chaff blown ‘round by the wind.
But if ya keep God’s commandments and handle these sacred things as the Lord commands, reckon no earthly or hellish power can take 'em from ya, ‘cause God’s got the strength to see His words come to pass.
He’ll fulfill every promise He made to ya, just as He’s done for our ancestral folks.
He promised to keep these things for a reason—to show His power to future generations.
And right now, He’s fulfilled one of those purposes, bringing back a heap of Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; He’s worked His wonders in 'em, and He’ll keep right on doin’ it for the folks yet to come; so they’ll be preserved.
That’s why I’m commandin’ ya, my son Helaman, to be on the ball with all my words, and stay diligent in followin’ God’s commandments laid down in writing.
And now, let’s talk about them twenty-four plates; keep ‘em close so we can pull back the curtain on the secrets and darkness of them lost folks; showin’ all their wicked ways and ugly deeds to this here people, so they know better and can recognize wickedness when they see it.
The Lord watched as His people started dabblin’ in dark deeds, cookin’ up secret murders and all sorts of wickedness; and He warned ‘em—repent or face being wiped off the face of the earth.
The Good Lord said: I’ll prepare a stone for my servant Gazelem that’ll shine through the dark to uncover them that serve me, revealing the evil works of their brothers—their dark deeds and filthy doings.
Now, my son, these interpreters were put together so that God’s word might be fulfilled, sayin’:
I’ll drag all them shady deeds outta darkness into the light; if they don’t turn from their ways, I'll wipe ‘em clean off the earth; everything hidden and rotten will be seen by every nation that holds onto this land.
And look here, son, they didn’t repent; that’s why they met their end, and the word of God rang true; their secret evils been dragged out of the shadows for all to see.
Now, I order ya to hang onto their oaths, covenants, and hidden agreements; keep all their signs and wonders from these folks, so they don’t get the idea and end up losin' their way too.
Because, I’ll tell ya, there’s a mighty curse on this land for all them dark workers; destruction'll come when they’re ripe for it; that’s why I want to spare these folks.
So keep the secret plans of their oaths and deals hidden; show the people only the ugly truth of murders and abominations; teach ‘em to despise such wickedness, reminding 'em that those folks were wiped out ‘cause of their sins and heavy wrongs.
For sure, they killed all the prophets God sent their way to call ‘em out on their wickedness; and the blood of the fallen cried out to God for revenge against their murderers; and so came the Lord’s judgment on those dark workers and their secret schemes.
Sure as the sun shines, cursed be this land forever for them dark workers and their secret plots, leading 'em to destruction ‘less they change before they’ve sipped the last of their unrighteous cup.
So remember what I’ve told ya, my boy; don’t trust them secret schemes with this people but teach ‘em to hold an everlasting hatred toward sin and wrong.
Preach to ‘em about repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; show ‘em to be humble and meek in heart; teach ‘em to stand firm against the devil’s temptations, holding tight to their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Teach ‘em to never tire when doin’ good, but to stay humble and meek; for that’s how they’ll find peace for their souls.
Oh, remember, my son, and gather wisdom while you’re young; learn to keep God’s commandments early on.
And for sure, cry out to God for all your needs; let everything you do be for the Lord, goin’ where He leads ya, and let your thoughts always be directed to Him; let the loves of your heart be tied to the Lord for all time.
Consult with the Lord in everything you do, and He’ll steer ya right; when it’s bedtime, lay down thinkin’ of the Lord, and He’ll keep watch over ya while you sleep; when the mornin’ breaks, let your heart sing praises to God; if you do these things, you’ll be raised up come judgment day.
And now, my son, I have some words to share ‘bout this thing our forefathers called a ball or a director—what they called Liahona, which means compass, seein’ how the Lord prepared it.
And no man can conjure up such fancy work; it was set up to show our ancestors the trail they ought to take through the wild.
And it guided ‘em as per their faith in God; so if they had faith to believe that the spindles would show ‘em the right way, well, it was done just so; they were blessed with this miracle, and many others, by the hand of God every single day.
But over time, ‘cause them miracles were done through simple means, it showed ‘em wondrous things. They got lazy and forgot to put faith into action, and so them marvelous works faded away, and they lost their way.
So they loitered in the wilderness, not movin’ forward straight-like, starvin’ from hunger and thirst, all ‘cause they wandered off the path.
Now, son, understand this ain’t without a lesson; as our ancestors got slothful towards the compass (which was a temporary tool), they didn’t prosper; same goes for spiritual matters.
For it’s as easy to heed the word of Christ, pointin’ ya straight to eternal happiness, as it was for our forefathers to look to this compass, pointin’ straight to the promised land.
So let me ask ya, isn’t there a teachin’ in all this? Just as surely as that compass led our ancestors to the promised land, if we follow Christ’s words, they’ll carry us beyond this valley of sorrow to a much better Promised Land.
Oh my son, don’t let laziness steal your way ‘cause it’s easy; our forefathers had it made; they only had to look to live; same goes for us. The path’s laid out, if we just look, we can live forever.
So now, son, make sure you take care of these sacred matters, keep your eyes on God and live. Go tell this people the good word, and keep your wits about you. Farewell, my son.
