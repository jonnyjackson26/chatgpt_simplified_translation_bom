Well now, the Lamanites sure got trounced in a mighty showdown—lots and lots of ‘em bit the dust—The wicked folks found themselves in a heap of trouble for eternity, while the good folks struck gold with everlasting happiness. ‘Twas around 77–76 B.C.
So it was that after the folks from Ammon set up camp in the land of Jershon, and a church also took root in that there land, the Nephite armies gathered ‘round Jershon, all along the borders of Zarahemla; then the Lamanites followed their kin into the wild.
And lo and behold, what a fierce battle it was; oh yes, somethin’ the likes of which had never been seen since Lehi packed up and left Jerusalem; tens of thousands of Lamanites fell, scattered like leaves in the wind.
Sure enough, there was also a heap of bloodshed among the Nephites; but despite that, the Lamanites were pushed back and scattered, and the good folks of Nephi found their way back home.
Now, this was a time of sorrow, and the cries of mourning echoed from one end of the land to the other, heard by all the Nephite folks—
Yup, the widows weepin’ for their husbands, fathers lamenting their sons, daughters wailin' for their brothers, and brothers for their fathers; the mourning filled the air for kin lost in that dreadful conflict.
And without a doubt, this day was dipped in sorrow; a solemn time of fasting and prayin’ was upon ‘em.
And thus concludes the fifteenth year since judges began presiding over the Nephite folks;
Now, here’s the tale of Ammon and his kin, their wanderings in Nephi’s land, the hardships they faced, their heartaches, their trials, and their unthinkable joy, alongside the safe return of their brethren in Jershon. May the good Lord, the Redeemer of all, bless their souls for all time.
And here’s the account of the tussles and quarrels amongst the Nephites, along with the brawls between Nephites and Lamanites; the fifteenth year of judge’s rule has come to an end.
From the first year to the fifteenth, no doubt, it’s brought about the loss of many thousands of lives; it’s painted a grim picture of bloodshed.
And the remains of many a thousand lay beneath the dirt, while others rot in heaps upon the ground; many thousands are grieving for their kin, fearing, as the good Lord promised, that those lost are caught up in a state of never-ending sorrow.
Yet, many thousands weep for their kin too, but they also rejoice and find hope, knowing, as the Lord has promised, that their loved ones are in God’s embrace, reveling in everlasting happiness.
Thus, it becomes clear how lopsided life can be ‘cause of sin and transgressions, and the devil’s tricks that ensnare the hearts of folks.
And just as clear is the great call for men to roll up their sleeves and work in the Lord’s vineyard; we see the good reason for sorrow and joy—sorrow from death and destruction among men, and joy because of Christ’s light brings life.
