Now my boy, I've got a thing or two to share with ya; reckon yer mind’s churnin’ ‘bout what happens when folks kick the bucket.
Looky here, I’m tellin’ ya straight, there ain’t no rising from the grave—if I’m puttin’ it plain, this here flesh ain't turnin' to spirit, this old body won’t see new life—'til after that fella Christ rides back into town.
Now you see, he’s the one who’ll make it all happen for the departed. But for now, listen here, my boy, the resurrection ain't kickin' off just yet. I’m fixin’ to reveal a secret; mind ya, there’s a heap of mysteries God’s keepin’ close to his vest. But I’m gonna share somethin’ I’ve been askin’ God ‘bout—it's all ‘bout that resurrection.
So here’s the score: there’s a set time when every soul’s gonna rise up from the grave. Now when that hour strikes, no one can say; but rest assured, God’s got that timetable down pat.
Now whether there's one time, or a second round, or maybe even a third go at it, don’t really matter none; ‘cause God’s got a handle on all this; and what I need to know is that there's a time set for everyone to stand up again.
Now there’s gotta be a stretch ‘tween when folks die and when they’re brought back to life.
And I’m mighty curious ‘bout what happens to folks’ souls from the moment they saddle up for the great beyond to when it’s time to rise again.
Now whether there’s more than one round for folks to rise really don’t change much; ‘cause not everybody checks out at the same time, and that don’t matter none; all’s just one long day to God, and time’s just a concept for us folks.
So it’s clear that there’s a time set for folks to rise up from the grave; and there’s a gap ‘tween death and that resurrection. And now, ‘bout that gap, I’ve been a-wonderin’ what becomes of people’s souls, and this is what I’ve been seekin’ the Lord to understand; and here’s what I’ve learned.
When that time rolls ‘round for all to rise, they'll realize that God’s got a grip on all the times that are laid out for us mortals.
Now, ‘bout the condition of the soul ‘tween death and the rising—listen up, an angel’s let me in on a little secret, that the spirits of all folks, as soon as they’ve dusted off this ol’ mortal coil, good or bad, head back home to the Good Lord who gifted ‘em life in the first place.
And then, it’ll come to pass that the spirits of the good folks are welcomed into a happy spot we call paradise, a place of rest and peace, where they won't have to worry ‘bout their troubles or pain.
But for those who tread the path of evil—well now, they got no claim to the Spirit of the Lord; them folks made their choice to do wrong instead of right; thus, the devil’s spirit crawled right in, took over their lives—and they’ll be tossed into outer darkness; there’ll be weepin’, wailin’, and gnashin’ of teeth, all on account of their own misdeeds, bein’ led around by the devil's will.
Now this is the state of the wicked souls, wrapped up in darkness, lookin’ down the barrel of God’s fiery wrath; and they’ll stay like that, just like the good folks in paradise, ‘til the resurrection comes knockin’.
Some folks reckon that this happy state and this sorry state of the soul before the resurrection is the first round of rising. Yeah, I’ll give it to ya, it could be called a resurrection, with spirits or souls gettin’ lifted up to either joy or misery based on what’s been said.
And again, it’s been mentioned that there’s a first resurrection, a rising of all who’ve been, are, or will be, right up to when Christ rises from the dead.
Now, we ain’t thinkin’ that this first resurrection is just about the souls bein’ sent off to happiness or misery. You can’t reckon that’s what it means.
I’m tellin’ ya, no way; it’s ‘bout reuniting the soul with its body, of them from Adam’s time right up to when Christ came back to life.
Now, whether those souls and bodies we been discussin’ will all come back together at once, the good and the bad, I ain’t got an answer for ya; let’s just say they’ll all be comin’ back; or in simpler terms, their resurrection happens ‘fore those who kicked the bucket after Christ rose.
Now, my son, I ain’t sayin’ their rising happens when Christ comes back; but I reckon it’s my two cents that the good folks’ souls and bodies are brought back together when Christ rises, and heads on up to heaven.
But whether it happens right at his rising or after, I won’t nail that down; I’ll just declare that there’s a gap between death and the body’s resurrection, and the condition of the soul swings between happiness and misery until God decides it’s time for the dead to rise and be joined back together, soul and body, standin’ before God, ready to be judged for their deeds.
Yeah, this lays the groundwork for the restoration of what the prophets been talkin’ about.
The soul’s gonna be rejoined with its body, and the body with the soul; yep, every limb and joint’s gonna find its way back home; not even a hair from the head’s gonna go missin’; everything’s gonna be restored to just the right and perfect state. 
And now, my boy, this here’s the restoration the prophets been yakkin’ about—
And then the good folks will shine bright in God’s kingdom.
But listen now, a dreadful fate looms for the wicked; they die to the things of righteousness; they’re unclean, and no unclean thing gets to waltz into God’s kingdom; they’ll be throwed out, made to deal with the fruits of their misdeeds, and they’ll be drinkin’ from the dregs of a bitter cup.
