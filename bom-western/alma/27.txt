Well now, when them Lamanites who set out for a showdown against the Nephites figured out after countless tussles that their attempts to wipe 'em out was about as useful as a screen door on a submarine, they packed their bags and hit the trail back to Nephi.
Now the Amalekites, seein' how they lost the skirmish, were hotter than a pistol. And when they realized they couldn't take it out on the Nephites, they started riling up their folks against their kinfolk, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, settin' the stage for a fresh round of trouble.
This here bunch flat out refused to bear arms, lettin' themselves get gunned down as their foes wanted.
When Ammon and his pals laid eyes on the destruction wrought upon their cherished folks, treatin’ 'em like they were heavenly messengers sent to pull 'em from the jaws of doom, they were stirred up with mercy, and they spoke to the king:
"Let’s round up this flock of the Lord’s and hightail it to Zarahemla to see our Nephite kin, so we don’t get wiped out by our enemies."
But the king looked at 'em and said: "Hold on now, the Nephites are liable to put us down for all the wrongdoings we've heaped upon 'em."
Then Ammon replied, "I'll go check in with the Lord, and if He tells us to saddle up for our kin, will y’all be ready to ride?"
And the king nodded, saying, "Yep, if the Lord gives us the green light, we’ll head on down to join our folks, and we’ll be their servants till we help make up for all the misdeeds we've done."
But Ammon reminded him, "Now hold your horses, King. Our folks have a rule against slavery laid down by my daddy; best for us to rely on their kindness."
The king replied again, “Ask the Lord, and if He says go, we’ll go; if not, we’ll just have to face the music here.”
So, Ammon saddled up and did just that, and the good Lord told him:
"Get this bunch outta here lest they meet their end; for ol' Satan's got a tight grip on the hearts of the Amalekites, stirring the pot against their kin to take 'em down; so skedaddle out of this place, and blessed is this group in this time, for I’ll keep 'em safe."
And so Ammon rode back and shared all the words the Lord had given him with the king.
Then they all gathered, every last soul of the Lord’s people, rounding up their critters and trekked outta the land, makin' their way into the wilderness that separated Nephi from Zarahemla, settlin' near the borders.
Ammon then said to 'em: “Listen up, my bros and I will ride into Zarahemla, while you folk stay put here ‘til we get back; we’re gonna see if our brothers are inclined to let y’all into their territory."
As Ammon was chartin' his course into the land, he and his buddies bumped into Alma over at that one spot, and let me tell ya, it was a real joyous reunion.
Ammon was so filled with happiness, he thought he’d burst, gettin' swallowed up in the joy of his Creator—so much so, he collapsed right there on the ground.
Now wasn’t that some mighty joy? That right there’s happiness that only the truly repentant and humble seeker can grasp.
Alma was also tickled pink to see his brothers, and so were Aaron, Omner, and Himni, but their joy didn’t quite knock 'em off their feet.
And it came to pass that Alma took his brothers back to Zarahemla, straight to his own home. They shared with the chief judge all the goings-on they’d seen in Nephi among their kinfolk, the Lamanites.
And the chief judge sent out a call across the land, askin' the folks what they thought about letin' in their kin, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies.
Soon enough, the word came back: “We’ll gladly hand over the land of Jershon, the one east by the sea adjacent to Bountiful down south; this land Jershon will go to our brothers for keeps.”
And we’re gonna set our armies between Jershon and Nephi to protect our kin in Jershon; we do this because they’re scared to pick up arms against their own folks for fear they’ll sin, and their fear comes from the heavy repentin' they’ve done over their many misdeeds and wicked ways.
Now, we’ll make sure our brethren inherit Jershon, and we’ll guard ‘em from their foes with our own soldiers, on the condition they share some of their goods to help us keep our armies strong.
Well, when Ammon caught wind of this, he rode back to the Anti-Nephi-Lehies with Alma right beside him, findin' them in the wilderness where they’d set up camp, and shared all the news. Alma also told 'em about his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and the rest of the crew.
This here news sparked a heap of joy amongst ‘em. They then headed down to claim the land of Jershon, mak’in it their own; from then on, the Nephites called ‘em the people of Ammon, and that’s a name they were known by ever after.
They settled in with the Nephites and were counted among those of the church of God. They were noted for their fervor for God and fellow men, bein’ honest and upright in all things, and they held tight to their faith in Christ right to the very end.
They looked upon spilling the blood of their kin with the worst kind of disgust; they never could be swayed to take arms against their folks, and they didn’t reckon death with any fear, given their hope in Christ and resurrection; for them, death was swallowed up by Christ’s victory over it.
So, they’d sooner endure the most tormenting and distressin’ deaths at the hands of their kin than take up a blade or sword against ‘em.
And so, they were a spunky and cherished bunch, truly favored by the Lord.
