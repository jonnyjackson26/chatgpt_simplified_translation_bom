Well now, listen up, folks! It was the sixty-ninth year of them judges runnin' the show over the Nephites when Nephi, son of Helaman, came back to Zarahemla from the north side.
He’d been up yonder preachin' the good Word to them folks, prophesyin' a heap of things.
But they turned their backs on all he had to say, and he couldn’t stick around, so he hit the trail back to where he was born.
Now, lookin’ at the wickedness that had settled over them, what with them Gadianton bandits sittin’ in judgment seats—usurpin' power and tossin' aside God’s commandments; they weren't doin' right by folks like they should've been;
They condemned the good folks 'cause they were righteous; let the guilty slide by 'cause they had fat wallets, makin' sure they were perched at the top of the government, makin' the rules just to line their pockets and seek glory, all while they indulged in adultery, theft, and murder—livin' wild according to their whims.
Now, this here sin had crept up on the Nephites in just a few short years; when Nephi laid eyes on it, his heart was heavy with sorrow, and he cried out in the torment of his spirit:
"Lordy, if only I could've lived in the days when my old man Nephi first stepped outta Jerusalem, to rejoice with him in the promised land; back then, folks were easy to talk to, held firm to God’s commandments, and didn’t go rushin’ off into sin; they were quick to hear the Lord’s words— 
Yup, if I'd been around then, my heart would’ve danced in joy over the righteousness of my kin.
But it seems I’m stuck in these days, and my heart’s gonna be weighed down with sorrow 'cause of my wayward relatives.
Now it so happened, on a fine ol’ tower in Nephi’s garden, by the road leadin' to the chief market in Zarahemla, Nephi took to kneelin’ on that tower right by the garden gate.
And sure enough, some fellas on their way by spotted Nephi pourin' out his heart to God from that tower; they ran off to tell the townsfolk what they’d witnessed, and before long, a big ol’ crowd gathered to figure out what was causin’ all that mournin' over the evil of the people.
So when Nephi got up, he saw all them folks who had come together.
He opened his mouth and said, “What brings y’all here? That I might reveal to ya your wicked ways?
Yup, I climbed this tower to pour out my soul to God, heavied by the sorrow in my heart ‘cause of your sins!
And because of my lamentin' and grievin’, y’all gathered 'round, wonderin'; and rightly so! You oughta be perplexed since the devil's got a mighty strong hold on your hearts.
How’d y’all let yourselves be led astray by the one who's out to drag your souls down to eternal misery and endless woefulness?
Oh, repent, I say! Turn around! Why are ya fixin’ to die? Turn back to the Lord your God. Why’s He left ya in the dust?
It’s 'cause you done hardened your hearts; you ain’t listenin’ to that good shepherd; you’ve made Him mad.
Behold, if you don’t gather ‘round and start repentin’, know this: He’ll scatter ya like sheep to the wolves and wild beasts.
Oh, how could you forget the Lord on the very day He set you free?
But look, you’re only lookin' to line your pockets, grab some praise from the folks, wantin' gold and silver. You've set your sights on the riches and shiny things of this world, leading to murder, plunderin', thievin', and accusin' your neighbors, doin' all kinds of wrong.
And for that, woeful troubles are fixin' to come your way ‘less you start repentin'. If you don’t turn back, this big ol' city, and all the others around here, they'll be snatched away from ya, and you won't have a place left to call home; for the Lord won’t be givin' you strength like He used to, to stand up against your enemies.
For hear me well, says the Lord: I won’t show my strength to the wicked folks, not one more than the other, ‘cept to those who’re ready to repent and heed my words. So let me tell ya, it'll be better for the Lamanites than it is for y’all ‘less you straighten up.
They ain't as wicked as you, for they ain't sinned against the great knowledge you’ve been given; the Lord will be good to them instead; He’ll stretch out their days and grow their families, while you’ll face total destruction unless you get right.
Wo unto you for that great abomination that’s wormed its way into your midst, tie yourself up with that secret band set up by Gadianton!
Woeful times are comin’ ‘cause of that pride you let seep into your hearts, liftin’ ya up over what’s right thanks to your great pile of riches!
Wo to you ‘cause of your wickedness and abominations!
And unless you repent, you’ll be lost; even your lands will be stripped from you, and you’ll be wiped off the face of the earth.
Now listen here, I ain’t just blowin’ smoke; I ain’t speaking this outta my own head; I know these things are true ‘cause the Lord’s made ‘em known to me, so I stand witness that they’re a’comin’.
