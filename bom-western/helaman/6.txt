Well, it was a couple of cowboy suns ago, in the sixty-second year of the judges sittin' in their high chairs, that a whole heap of happenings took place. Turns out, the Lamanites, bless their hearts, came to be quite a righteous bunch, so much so that their good deeds were shinier than them Nephites, on account of their steadfastness in their beliefs.
Now ya see, there were a good many Nephites who grew hard as a rock and stubborn as a mule, downright wicked it was. They cast aside the Good Lord's words, along with all the preachin' and prophesyin' that flowed through their land like a tumbleweed in a windstorm.
But let me tell ya, the church folks were happier than a lark, what with all them Lamanites findin' their way back to the light. The church of God took root amongst ‘em, and they all were like family, joyin’ in each other’s company, reveling in the good times together.
Then many a Lamanite rode down into the land of Zarahemla, shoutin’ loud and clear to the Nephites about how they turned their lives around, givin' ‘em a good dose of faith and a need to repent.
Yessiree, many a one stood up preachin' with a fire and brimstone that could knock yer boots off, humbling folks left and right till they was followin' God and His Lamb real close.
As fate would have it, a heap of Lamanites took off northward, and Nephi and Lehi rode along with 'em to spread the Good Word. And that there fifty-eighth year came to a close.
Lo and behold, peace reigned over the land like a gentle breeze, with Nephites wanderin' about wherever they pleased, minglin' with Lamanites without a care in the world.
Sure enough, Lamanites did the same, gallivanting ‘round as they wished, swappin’ goods and makin’ a livin’ like nobody's business, free as a bird.
By the by, them folks got richer than a banker's pet dog, both Lamanites and Nephites alike, sittin’ on mountains of gold and silver and all sorts of shiny treasures in both the north and the south.
Now, down south they called their land Lehi, and up north it was Mulek, named after Zedekiah's son. The good Lord led Mulek north and Lehi south, and boy, did He have a plan.
And I gotta tell ya, gold and silver could be found in heaps across both lands, precious stones galore, and skilled artisans roundin' up all sorts of shiny things to forge and refine, makin’ them folks rich as a Texas oilman.
They raised crops like there was no tomorrow, flourished like wildflowers, and multiplied like rabbits all over the land. They tended big herds and flocks, addin' to their wealth every day.
Their women worked hard, spinnin' and weavin’, fashioning all sorts of fine cloth to cover up their kin. The sixty-fourth year rolled by, peaceful as a quiet prairie night.
When the sixty-fifth year arrived, they were filled to the brim with joy and peace, preachin' and prophesying to beat the band about things yet to come. That sixty-fifth year zipped on by like a fast horse.
Then came the sixty-sixth year, where, by thunder, Cezoram met an untimely end at the hands of a mystery gunman while sittin’ on the judgment seat. His son, who was picked to step into his boots, met the same fate that very year. That’s how the sixty-sixth year rode out.
Then, as the sixty-seventh year dawned, folks started steppin’ back into wicked ways again.
See, the Good Lord had blessed 'em with such riches that they got to loungin', not fussin' ‘bout wars or bloodshed; they turned their eyes to their wealth, lookin’ to outshine each other, which led ‘em down a dark path of secret murders and robbin’ and plunderin’ just to get ahead.
And let me tell ya, them murderers and plunderers weren't but a band led by that scoundrel Kishkumen alongside Gadianton. Lo and behold, many of ‘em were even Nephites, but they was thick as thieves among the worst of the Lamanites, dubbed as Gadianton's robbin’, killin' gang.
It was ‘em who gunned down Chief Judge Cezoram and his boy right in the judgment seat; and wouldn’t ya know it, they disappeared without a trace.
Well, when the Lamanites caught wind of these robbers lurkin' ‘round, they were as sorrowful as a lost calf and did everything they could to drive ‘em outta the land.
But wouldn't ya figure it, ol' Satan stirred up a whole mess of Nephites’ hearts, gettin' 'em to cozy up with them robbers, joinin' their covenants and oaths, vowing to defend each other in sticky situations, so they wouldn’t have to pay for their wicked deeds.
They even got secret handshakes and words to identify their brothers-in-arms, so no matter what crimes they committed, they wouldn’t face the tough side of justice from one another.
This way, they could kill, rob, steal, and commit all sorts of wrongdoings, floutin’ the laws of the land and God’s commandments without a second thought.
If anyone from their ranks dared spill the beans on their wicked ways, they'd be judged by their own crooked standards instead of the laws of the land, cooked up by Gadianton and Kishkumen.
Now let me tell ya, it was these secret oaths and covenants that Alma warned his boy not to let out into the world, ‘cause they could lead folks straight to ruin.
Them dirty covenants didn’t come from Gadianton per the records Helaman had; no sir, they was planted right in Gadianton's heart by the very being who coaxed our first folks into snatchin' that forbidden fruit.
Yep, that same low-down scoundrel who whispered to Cain, tellin’ him if he took out his brother Abel, nobody would be the wiser. He’s been up to mischief ever since.
And wouldn’t you believe, he had a hand in gettin' those folks to build a tower tall enough to touch the sky. And it was him who led those travelers from that tower to this land, spreadin’ darkness and wickedness ‘til he dragged 'em into ruin and eternal punishment.
That same ol' rascal inspired Gadianton to continue with his evil deeds and secret murders, bringing it from the dawn of man right down to the present day.
Make no mistake, he’s the one who’s the root of all sin, carryin' on his dark work and secret killings, handin' down plots, oaths, and wicked schemes from one generation to the next as long as he can worm his way into the hearts of folks.
And now looky here, he's gotten a mighty strong hold on the Nephites; they've become wicked as a rattlesnake, with most of 'em strayin' from the path of righteousness, stampin' on God's commandments, and settlin' into their own ways, buildin’ idols out of gold and silver.
All them wrongdoings piled up on ‘em in just a few short years, so much so that most of ‘em came to be in the sixty-seventh year of the judges over Nephi’s people.
And they kept on wallowing in their sins in the sixty-eighth year too, much to the heartache of the good folks left standing.
And thus it played out that the Nephites started dwindlin’ away in faith, growin’ in wickedness and sins, while the Lamanites were overloadin’ on the knowledge of their God, keepin’ His rules and walkin’ truthfully before Him.
And we see how the Spirit of the Lord was pullin’ back from them Nephites, what with all their wickedness and stubborn hearts.
Meanwhile, the Lord started pourin' His Spirit out on the Lamanites, ‘cause they were easy to persuade and ready to believe His words.
Lo and behold, the Lamanites took it upon themselves to hunt down that Gadianton gang of robbers, preachin’ to the wilder part of them until that band of thieves was wiped clean from their midst.
On the flip side, the Nephites chose to lift those rascals up, starting from the most wicked and spreading out ‘til they took over all Nephite territory, luring most of the righteous down to follow their ways, partakin' in their dirty deeds and secret killings.
And that’s how they came to take over the whole kit and caboodle of the government, tramplin' the poor and meek underfoot and turnin' their backs on the humble folk who follow God.
So it was clear; they were in a sorry state, just ripe for destruction.
And that brings us to the end of the sixty-eighth year of judges over Nephi's people.
