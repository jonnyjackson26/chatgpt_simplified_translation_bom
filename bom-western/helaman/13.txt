Well now, here’s the lowdown on the tale of Samuel, the Lamanite, and his warnings to the Nephites:
In the year of our Lord, 86, them Nephites was still knee-deep in sin, the kind that’d make a rattlesnake blush, while the Lamanites were stickin' to the good book like a cowpoke to his trusty steed.
Then along came a fella named Samuel, a Lamanite, who rode into Zarahemla and started preachin’ at the folks. For many a day, he hollered about repentance, but they didn’t take kindly to his preachin’ and showed him the door—looked like he was fixin’ to head on back home.
But lo and behold, the good Lord spoke to him, tellin’ him to saddle up and ride back, to prophesy whatever was stirrin’ in his heart.
Now, they wouldn’t let him inside the town, so he climbed up on the wall like a scrappy cowhand and waved his arms, shoutin’ what the Lord laid on his heart for all to hear.
And he told ‘em: “Listen up, I’m Samuel, a Lamanite, and I’m bringin’ the good Lord’s words to you. The sword of justice is hangin’ over your heads, and if you don’t shape up, it won’t be long before it drops.”
Yup, heavy troubles are comin’ for this here crowd, and the only way to dodge ‘em is through true repentance and puttin’ faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who’s bound to come and bear the weight of the world.
He mentioned that an angel had shared this with him, bringin' joy to his spirit, and he was sent to deliver the news, but they wouldn’t give him the time of day.
So the Lord chimed in, sayin’, “Y’all got hard hearts, and if you don’t turn things around, I’ll take my words away and pull my Spirit from ya. Your kinfolk will be turned against you, too.”
And before you know it, four hundred years won’t pass before trouble finds you, with sword, hunger, and disease comin’ your way.
The Lord’s mighty mad, and in four generations, folks who ain't friendly will see your wreckage, and this’ll happen unless you get right with me; those future generations will witness your downfall.
But if you turn back to the Lord, I’ll lay down my anger, says the Lord; blessed are those who repent, but woe unto those who don’t.
Oh, woe be to the big town of Zarahemla, for it’s the righteous folks keeping it safe; I see a heap of ya hardenin' your hearts, says the Lord, and that ain't good.
But those who will repent shall have mercy. If it wasn’t for the good folks in this town, I’d rain fire from the heavens and wipe it out clean.
But it’s for the righteous’ sake that this town stands; the time’ll come, says the Lord, when you toss the good folk aside, and then you’ll be ripe for the picking, and woe unto this city for its wicked ways.
Yup, the city of Gideon ain’t lookin' too good either, what with its wickedness and all.
And all the towns round about where the Nephites roamed are in the same boat, weighed down by their sinful ways.
The Lord of Hosts declares that a curse is comin’ to the land ‘cause of the folks livin’ there, due to their misdeeds.
And the time’ll come when all you treasure hunters won’t find your gold or silver no more ‘cause the land’s been cursed, unless you’re righteous and hide your treasures with the Lord.
For I will, says the Lord, that you keep your treasures safe with me; cursed be those who don’t, ‘cause only the righteous are smart enough to stash ‘em with me, and those who don’t are cursed, along with their treasures, and no one’s gonna redeem ‘em thanks to the curse.
A day will come when folks hide their treasures away ‘cause they’re more in love with riches than with the Lord. If they don’t stash ‘em with me, woe unto them and their riches, for their time will come to get smacked down, says the Lord.
Hey you folks in this big ol’ city, listen close to what I’m sayin’; the Lord says you’re cursed ‘cause of your wealth, and your riches are cursed for the same reason, seein’ as you’ve turned your backs on Him.
You’ve forgotten all about the Lord who blessed you, always rememberin’ your riches instead of givin’ thanks; your hearts are swollen with pride and lookin’ down on others, full of envy, strife, malice, and every kind of wrongdoing.
That’s why a curse is settin’ in on this land and your riches too, all ‘cause of the sins y’all have committed.
Woe to this people, for the times have changed, and you’re tossin’ the prophets to the curb, mockin’ ‘em, throwin’ rocks, and doin’ all manner of evil against them, just like folks did back in the day.
And when you chat, you say: “If only we’d been around back in the good old days, we wouldn’t have hurt the prophets.” 
But the truth is, you’re just as bad; as sure as the Lord lives, if a prophet rides into town with the Lord’s message pointin’ out your sins, you get riled up and try to get rid of him, seekin’ all sorts of ways to do him in; you’ll call him a fake, sayin' he’s a sinner and makin’ deals with the devil ‘cause he’s callin’ out your evil deeds.
Yet, if a fella comes by and tells ya to do whatever feels good and says there ain't no trouble, you’ll welcome him with open arms, and claim he’s a prophet.
Yup, you’ll lift him up, givin’ him your gold and silver, dressin’ him in fancy clothes ‘cause he sweet-talks ya and tells you all is well; he’ll get no complaint from ya.
Oh, you wicked and twisted generation; you stubborn folks, how long do ya reckon the Lord will tolerate ya? How long will ya let yourselves be led by blind and foolish guides? How long will ya pick darkness over light?
For the anger of the Lord is already smoldering against ya; see, He’s cursed the land ‘cause of your misdeeds.
And soon enough, He’ll curse your riches, makin’ ‘em slippery so you can’t hold on to ‘em, and when you hit hard times, you won’t be able to cling to ‘em.
In those lean days, you’ll shout to the Lord, but it’ll all be for naught, for your ruin has already set in, and your downfall’s a sure thing; then you’ll be howlin’ and weepin’, says the Lord of Hosts.
And when that day comes, you’ll be lamentin’, sayin’, “Oh, I wish I’d turned from my ways and not harmed the prophets, stoning ‘em and runnin’ ‘em off. Oh, if only we’d remembered the Lord when He blessed us with riches, they wouldn’t have slipped away from us.”
You’ll see how ya laid a tool down one day, and dang if it ain't there the next; swords gone just when you needed ‘em for battle.
Yeah, you stashed your treasures away, and they’ve slipped right through your fingers ‘cause of the land’s curse.
Oh, if only we’d repented when the Lord sent His word; the land is damned, and everything’s become slippery, and we just can’t hold on to what we used to have.
You’re surrounded by evil spirits, caught up by the very ones who aim to destroy your souls. Your sins are mighty, Lord, can’t you ease your anger?
But know this, your chance to turn things around is run out; you’ve put off your salvation for far too long, and now destruction ain’t just on the horizon—it’s a done deal; you’ve chased after happiness in wrongdoings, which ain’t the way of the righteous that leads us to our true Head up above.
Oh, you people of the land, how I wish you’d take my words to heart! I pray the Lord turns His anger from ya, and that you turn around and find salvation.
