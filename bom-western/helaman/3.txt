Well now, it happened in the forty-third year of them judges sittin' tall, that there weren't no fussin’ ‘mongst the Nephites 'cept a mite of pride floatin' ‘round the church, causin' a few spats among folks, but they settled up nice-like by the end of that year.
Then came the forty-fourth year, and folks got along just fine; pretty much the same in the forty-fifth year too.
But come the forty-sixth year, oh shoot, there was a ruckus and all sorts of squabblin’, so much so that a whole heap of folks packed their bags and took off from Zarahemla, headin’ north to claim themselves some wild land.
They traveled quite the long haul, hittin' big ol' lakes and rivers along the way.
Yessiree, they spread out all over that land, wherever it weren’t left barren and tree-less, ‘cause so many had gone and claimed it before.
But now, no part of the land was barren ‘cept for lack of timber; reckon the folks who had been there before had caused such a mess it got nicknamed desolate.
With not much timber to be found on the surface, the folks that moved in got real handy with cement; they built themselves some sturdy houses where they settled down.
They started multiplyin’ and movin’, makin’ a big ol’ spread from the south all the way to the north, coverin' the land from sea to sea.
Them folks up north set up camp in tents and cement houses, lettin' any tree that dared to sprout grow tall, hopin' it’d provide wood down the line for their homes, cities, temples, and all sorts of buildings.
As timber ran low up north, they sent a whole mess of it by ship.
This way they helped the northern folks put together plenty of cities, made of both wood and cement.
Now, there were some Ammonites, born of Lamanite blood, who also made their way to this land.
And there were plenty of records kept by these folks, lots of 'em, filled with details and all sorts of happenings.
But listen here, even a hundredth of what these folks went through, the tales of the Lamanites and Nephites, their battles and bickerin’, preachin’s and prophecies, ship-buildin’ and temple-makin’, their wickedness and goodness, and every sort of mischief and sin, just can't fit in one book.
Yet, there's a whole passel of books and records of all kinds kept mainly by the Nephites.
They passed ‘em down from one generation to the next, even till they got led astray, suffered murders, got plundered and chased off, mixing in with the Lamanites ‘til they hardly even got called Nephites anymore, turning wicked, wild, and ferocious, becoming Lamanites pure and simple.
Now I’m back to my tale; what I’ve shared happened after some mighty big arguments, disturbances, battles, and squabbles among the Nephites.
The forty-sixth year of the judges wrapped up;
And it came to pass that the squabbles kept on in the forty-seventh year, and even rolled into the forty-eighth.
But Helaman, he sat in that judgment seat dishin’ out justice fair and square; kept his eye on God’s laws and did what was right in the Mighty One’s sight day in and day out, walkin’ just like his daddy, prosperin’ in the land.
Now, he had two boys. The older he named Nephi, and the younger he called Lehi. They were growin’ up in the ways of the Lord.
And it came to pass that the fighting and fussin’ eased up a bit toward the end of the forty-eighth year of those judges over the Nephites.
Then in the forty-ninth year, there was a whole lotta peace settlin’ in, ‘cept for them secret plots that ol’ Gadianton the robber had laid down in the more settled parts, which them in charge didn’t even catch wind of, so they weren’t run out of the land.
In that same year, the church saw some real mighty prosperity, so much so there were thousands joinin’ up and gettin’ baptized to turn from their wrong ways.
So bountiful was the church’s success, and the blessings showered down on the folks, that even the high priests and teachers couldn’t believe their eyes.
And it came to pass that the Lord's work thrived, bringin’ in many souls, even tens of thousands, into the fold of goodness.
We can see that the Lord’s merciful to anyone who’s willin’ to holler out to Him sincerely.
Yup, the gates of heaven swung wide for all who put their trust in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Right there, we reckon that any who wants to can latch onto the word of God, sharp and lively, cuttin’ through the tricks and traps of the devil, guidin’ the man of Christ on a straight and narrow path across that deadly gulf meant for the wicked—
And depositin' their souls—yep, their immortal souls—right there by God’s side in heaven, a seat at the table with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all our holy ancestors, never to wander again.
And in that year, joy resounded through the land of Zarahemla and all the outlying regions, even across all the lands held by the Nephites.
Peace and big ol’ joy remained in the rest of that forty-ninth year, and likewise in the fiftieth year of their judges.
In the fifty-first year, there still was peace, ‘cept a parcel of pride crept into the church—not in God’s church, but into the hearts of those claimin’ to belong to it—
And that pride lifted ‘em high, even leadin’ to the persecution of their own kinfolk. Now that was a serious wrong, causin’ the more humble ones to face tough times and wade through heaps of trials.
Yet they kept on fastin' and prayin’ plenty, growin' stronger in humility and firmer in their faith of Christ, fillin’ their hearts with joy and peace, settlin’ their souls ‘cause they surrendered to God.
And it came to pass that the fifty-second year wrapped up peaceful too, even with that nasty pride that had gotten a foothold in folks’ hearts; it had sprouted up due to them gainin' riches and success in the land, a daily growin’ problem.
In the fifty-third year of them judges, ol’ Helaman passed on, and his oldest boy Nephi took over the reins. He filled that judgment seat with justice and fairness, keptin' God’s commandments and walkin’ in his father’s ways.
