Well now, listen up, folks. It’s high time y’all start diggin’ into these here matters. I’m givin’ ya a command, so search ‘em out real thorough-like; Isaiah’s words are as mighty as a wild stallion.
No doubt, he was talkin’ 'bout all the folks of the House of Israel, so it stands to reason he had some words for the Gentiles too.
Everythin’ he said has happened, or will happen, just like he foretold.
So pay close attention to what I’m sayin’; jot down the things I’ve shared with ya, ‘cause when the Good Lord’s set on it, this here will reach the Gentiles.
And anyone who listens up to my words, turns their ways around, and gets baptized, they’ll find salvation. So, seek out the prophets, ‘cause there’s plenty of ‘em out there givin’ word on these matters.
Soon as Jesus finished up his talk, he looked back at ‘em, havin’ laid bare all them scriptures they’d received, and he said: Now listen closely, I reckon you oughta write down some other scriptures you ain’t got yet.
Then he turned to Nephi and said: Hand over the record you been keepin’.
When Nephi fetched those records and laid ‘em before him, Jesus took a good gander at ‘em and said:
I tell ya true, I told my good ol’ servant Samuel, the Lamanite, to make a mention to this here people. On the day when the Father shines His glory through me, there’ll be a whole heap of saints comin’ up from the dead, showin’ themselves to many, and helpin’ ‘em out. So I asks you: Ain’t that right?
His disciples replied: Yes, Lord, Samuel surely spoke as you have said, and it all came to pass.
Then Jesus queried: How come y’all ain't jotted down that a bunch of saints got up and made their appearances to many folks, givin’ assistance?
And it came to pass that Nephi recollected that this here hadn’t been set down yet.
So Jesus gave the word, demandin’ it be written, and sure enough, it got wrote just like he said it should.
Now, when Jesus had laid out all that scripture in one shot, he ordered ‘em to teach what he had explained to them.
