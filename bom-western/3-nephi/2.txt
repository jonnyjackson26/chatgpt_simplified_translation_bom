Well, I'll tell ya, the wickedness and all sorts of nasty dealings were on the rise among the folks—The Nephites and Lamanites banded together to defend their homesteads against them Gadianton robbers—Those Lamanites who found the light turned whiter than a fresh snowfall and were called Nephites. 'Bout A.D. 5–16.
So it happened that the ninety-fifth year drifted on by, and folks started forgettin' all them mighty signs and wonders they’d heard tale of, and they became less and less amazed by any sign or wonder from up above, so much so that their hearts got hard as a cowboy's boot, their minds as blind as a bat, and they started doubting all that they had seen and heard—
Cookin' up all sorts of foolish notions in their hearts, saying it was all just a work of men and the devil's doin’, to lead folks astray and pull the wool over their eyes; and that’s how the devil got a hold on folks again, blinding their eyes and makin’ ‘em think that Christ's teachings were just a bunch of nonsense.
Then the people started growin’ strong in their wicked ways and nasty stuff, not believing no more signs or wonders were comin’; and Satan was out there, leading folks astray, temptin’ ‘em, and makin’ ‘em commit great evils in the land.
And so rolled on the ninety-sixth year; then the ninety-seventh year passed on; the ninety-eighth year rode out; and the ninety-ninth year sauntered away;
And the hundredth year had come and gone since the days when old Mosiah was king over the Nephites.
And six hundred and nine years had drifted away since Lehi pulled up stakes and left Jerusalem.
And nine years had passed since the sign was given, as the prophets foretold, that Christ would come into the world.
Now the Nephites started counting their time from that moment the sign was tossed out, or from Christ's arrival; that's why nine years ticked by.
And Nephi, the father of Nephi who held onto the records, didn’t make his way back to Zarahemla and had become a ghost in the land.
And it happened that folks kept on livin’ in sin, despite all the preachin’ and prophesying thrown their way; and so the tenth year slipped away too, and the eleventh year rolled on in wickedness.
In the thirteenth year, wars broke out and folks started fussin’ all over the place; those Gadianton robbers got so numerous, they were takin’ down folks left and right, layin' waste to towns, and spreadin’ death and devastation all ‘round, makin’ it necessary for all the people, both Nephites and Lamanites, to take up arms against 'em.
So, all them Lamanites who’d found their faith in the Lord teamed up with their Nephite kinfolk, bein’ pushed into arm ’n up for the safety of their skins and their families, fightin’ against them Gadianton robbers, holdin’ onto their rights, church privileges, freedom, and liberty.
Now, before that thirteenth year passed, those Nephites were on the brink of bein’ wiped out ‘cause of this all-out war, which had grown mighty fierce.
And it came to pass that them Lamanites who joined up with the Nephites were counted among ‘em;
And the curse that had been on them was lifted, and their skin turned white like the Nephites’;
And their young bucks and gals became a sight to behold, fairer than a spring bloom, and they were counted among the Nephites and called Nephites. And that’s how the thirteenth year wrapped up.
In the fourteenth year, the tussle ’tween the robbers and the Nephites kept goin’, heatin’ up real fierce; still, the Nephites managed to get the better of ‘em a bit, driving ‘em back out into the mountains and their hidden hideouts.
And that’s how the fourteenth year came to an end. Then in the fifteenth year, them robbers came at the Nephites again; and ‘cause of the Nephites’ wickedness and all their bickering and squabblin’, them Gadianton robbers had the upper hand.
So ended the fifteenth year, and the Nephites were caught in a whirlwind of troubles; with destruction hangin' over 'em like a thundercloud, they were fixin’ to get knocked down ‘cause of their sinful ways.
