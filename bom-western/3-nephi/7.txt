Well now, let me spin ya a yarn 'bout some ruckus that happened in the land. Ya see, the head honcho of the law was done in, and just like that, the whole government went belly up, while folks split into their own little clans—one of 'em, a rascal named Jacob, took the reins in a shady group—Nephi, on the other hand, started preachin' about turnin' from their ways and havin' faith in the good Lord—he was even visited by angels who were lendin' a hand daily, and he pulled off a miracle, raisin' his brother from the grave—lots of folks saw the light and got dunked.
Now listen close, 'cause I'm tellin' ya, there was no king in that land; this here year, the thirtieth, they went and did in the chief judge right there in his seat.
Then folks started squabblin', split up into tribes, with each fella clingin' to his kin and buddies; that’s how they knocked down the government.
Each tribe picked a leader, and just like that, they formed their own little bands with chiefs givin' orders.
Now it turns out, there wasn't a soul among ‘em that didn’t have a heap of family, and these tribes grew like weeds.
Ain't none of this shindig caused no wars yet; all this wickedness crept in ‘cause folks let the devil take the reins.
The laws of the land fell apart ‘cause of the sneaky folks who were tight with the ones who offed the prophets.
And things got rough out there, so much so that even the good folks were nearly all mucked up in sin; reckon there were just a handful of good ones left among 'em.
So six years rolled by, and the main bunch of folks turned away from doin' right, just like a dog goes back to its own upchuck, or a pig wallows in the mud.
Now this secretive lot, who brought this heap of trouble, gathered 'round and set a feller named Jacob at their head;
They crowned him their king, so he led this no-good gang; he was one of the chief troublemakers who'd been speakin' out against the prophets preachin' about Jesus.
Their number wasn’t as grand as the tribes of the folks united together, 'cept for their leaders who made the rules for their own tribes; still, they were foes, and though they weren’t righteous, they sure banded together against those who aims to take down the government.
So Jacob saw that their foes outnumbered 'em, bein' the king of the misfits, and he told his people to hightail it to the northern wilds, buildin' a kingdom till other dissenters joined 'em, flatterin’ 'em ‘bout how many would show up, so they could be tough enough to take on the other tribes; and they took off.
They moved so quick that nothin' could slow ‘em down till they was outta reach of the people, and that wrapped up the thirtieth year all tight-like.
Then in the thirty-first year, they was back to bein’ in tribes, folks clingin’ to their own kin, but they struck a deal not to throw punches at each other; yet they weren’t on the same page when it came to laws and how to run things, bein' set up by their chiefs. But they sure laid down some strict rules to keep one tribe from messin’ with the other, which brought ‘em a tad of peace; still, their hearts strayed far from the good Lord, and they stoned the prophets, bootin’ 'em outta their midst.
Then Nephi, who had been touched by angels and talked to by the Lord Himself—having seen those heavenly beings, bein' a witness, and gettin' the power to know all about Christ’s works—he felt real sorrow over their stubborn hearts and dim-witted minds, so he saddled up and rode out to 'em that same year, preachin’ loud and proud about turnin’ from their ways and the chance for forgiveness through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
He shared a heap of tales with 'em; too many to write down, and some just wouldn’t fit, so they ain’t penned here. Nephi was preachin' with plenty of strength and authority.
Before long, they got their dander up 'cause his power was greater than theirs; they couldn’t just turn their backs on his words, ‘cause his faith in the Lord Jesus was so strong, even angels were helpin’ him out daily.
By the name of Jesus, he chased off evil spirits and raised his brother from the dead after that fella got stoned and died at the hands of the crowd.
Folks saw all this goin' on and couldn't help but bear witness to it, but they sure were mad at him for his power; he performed many more wonders right in front of ‘em, all in the name of Jesus.
And the thirty-first year rolled on, with only a scant few convertin’ to the Lord; but those who did got stirred up and told everyone they’d been struck by the power of the Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they placed their trust.
The ones who had evil spirits cast out and got healed showed everyone they’d been touched by the Spirit of God and had received their healing; they showcased signs and did some mighty works among the folks.
So also slipped away the thirty-second year. Nephi hollered out to the people at the start of the thirty-third year, preachin' repentin’ and the chance to have their sins wiped clean.
Don't forget now, no one who found a way to repent got away without bein’ baptized in water.
So Nephi appointed some men for this task, for all who came to ‘em needed to get dunked, this bein' a sign and a testimony before God and the folks that they'd repented and cleared their sins.
And plenty folks got baptized at the starts of this year, and so the majority of the year passed right on by.
