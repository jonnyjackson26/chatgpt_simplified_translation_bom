Listen up, y’all Gentiles, and pay close attention to the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the livin’ God, which he’s ordered me to share with ya, ‘cause, I reckon he’s tellin’ me to put it down in writin’, sayin':
Turn yer ways around, all you Gentiles; drop them wicked habits and turn from yer evil doin’s, from yer lies and deceits, from all them forays into sin, your sneaky misdeeds, false idols, and murders. Stop schemin’ like them priests, let go of yer envy and brawlin’, and turn from all that wickedness. Come on over to me and get dunked in my name, so you can wash away your sins and be filled with the Holy Ghost, and join the ranks of my folks who belong to the house of Israel.
