Well now, the hush settled over the land like a soft blanket—The voice of the Good Lord promises to round up His folks just like a mama hen does with her chicks—The more virtuous folks among 'em were kept safe. 'Bout A.D. 34-35.
Well now, folks, it happened that all the folks in the land heard these words, and they all gave their witness. After all this was said, a heavy silence fell over the land for a long stretch of hours;
For sure, the folks were so thunderstruck that they stopped their wailing and howlin’ for their kin who had been taken down; so, there was silence across the whole land for many, many hours.
Then, lo and behold, another voice called out to the folks, and every last one of ‘em heard it, givin’ their witness, sayin’:
O you people of them grand cities that done fell, who are kin to Jacob, yep, from the house of Israel, how many times I tried to gather you up as a hen gathers her chicks beneath her wings, and took care of ya.
And again, oh how often I wished to gather you just like that hen does with her chicks, yes indeed, O you folks of the house of Israel who’ve stumbled; yes, O you folks of the house of Israel from Jerusalem, how many times I would have gathered you, but you didn’t want any part of it.
O you house of Israel which I’ve let be, how many times will I gather you as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, if you’d just turn around and come back to me with all your heart.
But if you don’t, O house of Israel, your homes are gonna be laid to waste ‘til the promise made to your forebears comes to pass.
And it came to pass that after the folks took in these words, they began to shed tears and howl again over the loss of their kin and buddies.
And thus three days drifted on. Then in the mornin’, the darkness lifted off the land, the ground stopped shakin’, the rocks settled down, the terrible groans faded away, and all them ruckus sounds quieted down.
And the earth came back together, standin’ firm; and the sadness, wailing, and howlin’ of the folks who still remained came to a hush; their sorrow turned to joy, and their laments shifted into praises and thanks for the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
And this here is as far as the scriptures got fulfilled that the prophets had spoken.
And it was the more righteous bunch who made it through, the ones who welcomed the prophets and didn’t throw stones at ‘em; they hadn’t spilled the blood of the saints, and they were spared—
And they didn’t find themselves sunk and buried deep in the ground; had no one drownin’ in the sea's depths; they weren’t singed by fire, squashed flat, or swept away by the storm; and they didn’t get carried off by the whirlwind or overpowered by the haze of smoke and darkness.
So now, if anyone’s readin’, listen close; whoever’s got the scriptures, dig into ‘em, and check if all these deaths and fiery wrecks, the smoke, the tempests, the whirlwinds, and the earth that opened up, all ain't pointin' to the fulfillin’ of what the holy prophets foretold.
Look here, I’m tellin’ you, many have testified about these things at Christ’s comin’, and they paid the price for it.
Yep, the prophet Zenos spoke about these matters, and also Zenock spoke on ‘em, 'cause they had a special word for us, the remnant of their kin.
Looky here, our forebear Jacob also spoke about a remnant of Joseph’s seed. And don’t we count as part of that remnant? And the words that testify to us, aren’t they jotted down on the brass plates our father Lehi brought back from Jerusalem?
And it came to pass that by the end of the thirty-fourth year, you listen here, I’m fixin’ to show you that the Nephites who were spared, along with those called Lamanites who stayed safe, were lavished with blessings, ‘specially after Christ took the trip up to heaven; he truly showed himself to ‘em—
Showed off his body to ‘em, and took care of their needs; and I’ll share the story of his ministry in due time. So for now, I’ll wrap up my talk.
