Well now, folks, let me spin ya a yarn 'bout the gathering of the good folks of Israel when that there Book of Mormon comes roun'—them Gentiles gonna be settin' up as free folks right here in America—if they’re smart enough to believe and follow the good word; otherwise, they'll find themselves on the wrong side of the divide, face down in the dust—Israel's gonna roll up their sleeves and build themselves a fine New Jerusalem, and the long-lost tribes, well, they’ll be makin' their way back home.
Now, I’m givin’ ya a proper sign, so you’ll know when the time is ripe for all this to unfold—that I ain't forgotten my folks, the house of Israel, who’ve been scattered far and wide, and I'm fixin’ to set up my Zion once more among ‘em;
So listen up, here’s that sign I’m lettin' you in on—when all these things I’m tellin’ ya and what I’ll lay out for ya down the line come to light, by the power of the Holy Ghost that the Father is givin’ you, you’ll know what's what ‘bout this remnant of Jacob and my people who’ll be tossed around by the Gentiles;
You can bet your boots, when the Father spills the beans and sends the word your way, you can be sure it’ll be clear;
For it's the Father’s wisdom to set ‘em up here in this land, so they can be free as a bird through His power, and these mighty works will flow down to a piece of your kin, fulfilling the promise the Father made to his folks, O house of Israel;
Therefore, when these happenings and what’s yet to come, from the Gentiles, fall into the laps of your kin who’re strayin’ ‘cause they ain’t got faith, bein’ caught up in their wicked ways;
It’s right and true that the Father wants this to come from the Gentiles, showin’ off His power, so if the Gentiles don’t harden their hearts, they can turn back to me, get dunked in my name, and learn the real truths of my teachings, so they can be counted as one of my own, O house of Israel;
And when my folk start to catch wind of these happenings—it’s gonna be a mighty sign for ‘em, tellin’ ‘em the Father’s work is already in motion, fulfilling the promise made to the house of Israel.
When that day rolls ‘round, kings will be sittin’ tight-lipped ‘cause they’ll finally see things they ain’t ever heard tell of before;
For on that day, just for my sake, the Father’s gonna stir up an incredible work amongst ‘em; some folks won’t believe it, even when a man stands up to tell the tale.
But let me tell ya, my servant’s life is safe in my hands; they ain’t gonna lay a finger on him, even when he’s rough around the edges ‘cause of 'em. I’ll fix him up, showin’ ‘em that my wisdom outshines the devil’s tricks.
So it comes to pass that anyone who won’t believe my words, me bein’ Jesus Christ, which the Father’s set me to share with the Gentiles, and giving me power to do so (like Moses foretold), those folks will find themselves cut off from my people in the covenant.
My people, the remnant of Jacob, will be among the Gentiles, sure as a lion prowlin’ through the forest, a young lion sneakin’ ‘round the sheepfolds, treading down and tearing apart as he goes, and ain't no one gonna save ‘em;
Their hands will be raised high against their enemies, and all who stand against ‘em will be chopped down.
Yessiree, woe betide the Gentiles if they don’t turn from their wicked ways; for on that day, says the Father, I'll be ridin’ 'em hard, knockin’ their horses out from under ‘em, and smashing their chariots;
I’ll bring the cities of your land down to rubble and tear down all them fortresses;
I’ll get rid of the witches and sorcerers, and you won’t be havin' any more fortune tellers around;
I’ll cut down those stone carvings and all them idols you’ve been bowin’ down to, and y’all won’t be worshippin' what your own hands made anymore;
I’ll yank them groves straight out from the ground, and so I’ll lay waste to your towns.
And it’ll be the case that all them lies, deceits, envies, squabbles, priestly tricks, and fornicatin’ will finally be done for.
For it’s written that on that day, says the Father, anyone who won’t repent and come to my Beloved Son will be out on the fringe of my people, O house of Israel;
And I’ll bring vengeance and fury down on 'em, just like I done with the heathens before, things they’ve never even dreamed of.
But if they’ll turn back, listen to my words, and keep their hearts soft, I’ll set up my church among ‘em, and they’ll become part of the covenant, counted among the remnant of Jacob, to whom I’ve bestowed this land as their rightful home;
And they’ll help my people, the remnant of Jacob, along with anyone from the house of Israel who shows up, so they can lay the foundation of a city called the New Jerusalem.
Then they’ll help gather my people who’ve been scattered all over this land, bringing ‘em to the New Jerusalem.
And the power of heaven will come down amongst ‘em; I’ll be right there in the midst.
Then the Father’s work will kick off, and the gospel will be shared among the remnant of this people. I tell you straight, that day the Father’s work will begin among all the scattered, even the lost tribes the Father led away from Jerusalem.
That’s right, the work will start with all the scattered of my people, with the Father makin' the path so they can come unto me, callin' on the Father in my name.
Yup, and then the work will begin with the Father among all nations, preparin’ the way for his folks to come home to their rightful land.
And they’ll come out from every corner of the earth; they won’t be rushed or flighty, for I’ll be leadin’ the way, says the Father, and I’ll be watchin’ their backs.
