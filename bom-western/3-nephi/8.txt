Tempests, earthquakes, fires, whirlwinds, and all sorts of ruckus prove that Christ got himself crucified—many folks met their end—darkness swathed the land for three whole days—those still kickin' lamented their misfortune.
Now, it so happened that according to our ledger—which we know to be on the level—'cause it was a righteous feller keeping it—he truly performed a heap of miracles in the name of Jesus; and no man could pull off a miracle in Jesus’ name 'less he was clean as a whistle from his sins.
And now, if this feller ain't messed up the calculation of our time, the thirty-third year done passed on by;
And the folks started lookin' hard for the sign that the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, had mentioned, yep, waitin’ for the spell of darkness that’d cover the land for three days.
And there was a whole heap of doubt and squabblin’ among the folks, even with all them signs that had been thrown their way.
Then it came to pass in the thirty-fourth year, in the first month, on the fourth day, a mighty storm blew in, like nothin’ the land had ever seen before.
And there was a rip-roarin’ tempest; the thunder was so fierce it shook the ground like it was fixin’ to split wide open.
And them lightnin’ bolts were sharper than a rattler’s fang, like nothin’ the land had ever witnessed.
And the town of Zarahemla caught fire.
And the city of Moroni sank right into the depths of the sea, and them folks drownin’ like rats.
And the earth rose up over the city of Moronihah, turnin’ the place into a mighty mountain.
And there was a heap of destruction in the southern lands.
But lo and behold, the north took a worse beating; it was like the whole earth got turned upside down because of the storm and whirlwinds, with rumblin’ thunder and lightnin’, and the ground shakin’ like a wild bronco.
The roads turned to muck, and smooth paths turned rough as a bear’s back.
A good many fine towns got swallowed up, and others caught fire, while some shook so hard they collapsed, leavin’ their folks meetin’ a grim fate, and them places left all empty.
Some towns stood strong; but they took a mighty blow, with plenty of folks among 'em walkin' that narrow path to the great beyond.
There were some who got swept away in the whirlwind, and where they went none could tell, 'cept they knew they were snatched up.
And thus the land lay twisted and deformed, what with the storms, rumblin’ thunder, lightnin’, and earth shakin’ like a wild dance.
And the rocks split apart; they broke all over the land, so much so that folks found 'em in chunks, seams, and cracks everywhere you looked.
And it came to pass that when the thunder, lightnin’, storm, tempest, and earth quakin’ finally took a breather—for it lasted about three hours; some folks claimed it was longer, but it all wrapped up in about three hours—then behold, darkness blanketed the land.
And it came to pass thick darkness covered up the whole land, so much so that those still standin’ felt the suffocatin’ weight of it;
There was no light to be found anywhere, no candles, no torches; couldn't even get a fire goin’ with their dry wood, so there wasn't a glimmer of light to be seen.
And there wasn’t a spark of light in sight, not a fire, nor flicker, neither sun, moon, nor stars—so heavy was the fog of darkness drawin' over the land.
And it lasted three whole days without a single ray of light; folks were grievin' and wailin’ and weepin’ all across the land, full of sorrow and mournin' 'cause of the darkness and the terrible destruction that had hit 'em.
In one spot, you could hear ‘em cryin’ out, sayin’: “Oh, if only we’d turned our ways before this terrible day hit, then our kin would’ve been spared, and not burned in that big ol’ city of Zarahemla.”
And in another place, you could hear ‘em moanin’, sayin’: “Oh, if only we’d changed our tune before this dreadful day, and didn’t go killin’ and stonin’ the prophets and kickin’ 'em out; then our mamas and lovely daughters, and our little ones would’ve made it, and not been buried under that city of Moronihah.” So went the mournin’ of the people, loud and sorrowful.
