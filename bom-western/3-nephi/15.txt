Well now, after Jesus wrapped up his talk, he took a gander at the crowd and said to 'em: "Listen up, you folks have heard what I told ya before I headed up to my Father in the sky; so whoever keeps these words of mine and puts 'em to good use, I’ll be raisin' him up on the final day."
It so happened that when Jesus finished speakin', he noticed some folks among 'em were ponderin’ and scratchin' their heads about what he said regarding the old law of Moses; they didn’t quite cotton to the fact that the old ways had passed on, and all things were gettin’ a fresh start.
He said to 'em: "Don’t be baffled that I mentioned the old ways are done with and the new ways are here to stay."
Listen here, I'm tellin' ya that the law given to Moses has run its course.
I’m the one who handed down that law, and I’m the one who made a promise with my people Israel; so in me, that law is all wrapped up, ‘cause I come to make it whole; ain't no more law to follow now.
Rest assured, I don’t go around knockin' the prophets; everythin' that ain’t come to pass through me, I’m here to tell ya, it will surely happen.
And just ‘cause I mentioned that the old ways are behind us, doesn’t mean I'm gettin’ rid of what’s been said about what’s still to come.
Cause seein' things clear, the promise I made with my kinfolk ain't fully accomplished; but that law Moses got from me has found its end right here.
I'm the law and the light, folks. Look to me, hold on tight till the very end, and you’ll be livin’; ‘cause for them that stick it out, I’ll hand over eternal life.
Take heed, I've laid down the commandments for ya; now make sure to follow 'em. This here is what the law and the prophets are all about, as they truly spoke of me.
When Jesus said all this, he turned to the twelve he picked out: 
"You are my followers; you’re like a beacon for this crowd, part of the leftover bunch from Joseph's kin."
"Now, this here land is what you’ve got coming to ya; the Father’s given it to ya."
And the Father never gave me any orders to spill the beans to your folks back in Jerusalem.
He never told me to talk about the other tribes of Israel either, those the Father led off into different territories.
What the Father did tell me was this:
"I got other sheep not part of this pen; I need to gather 'em ‘round, and they’ll listen to my call; and there’ll be one pen and one shepherd to look after ‘em."
Now, 'cause of their stubborn ways and lack of belief, they didn’t catch onto my words; so I couldn’t say no more about what the Father had laid on my heart.
But I'll tell ya true, the Father commanded me to share this with you: you’ve been kept away from 'em 'cause of their wrongdoings; and that’s why they don’t know you exist.
And truly, I’ll say again that the Father has set the other tribes apart; and it’s on account of their wickedness that they don’t recognize ‘em.
I’m tellin’ ya straight, you are those I was speakin’ of: "Other sheep I have that ain't part of this here pen; I need to gather 'em up, and they'll hear my call; and there’ll be just one pen with one shepherd goin’ forward."
They didn’t catch my drift, thinkin’ I was talkin’ about the Gentiles; they didn’t realize the Gentiles would come to faith through your preachin'.
They didn’t understand I meant they'd hear my voice, nor did they grasp that the Gentiles wouldn't hear me at all, unless it was by the Holy Spirit.
But hear me now, you folks have both heard my voice and laid eyes on me; you’re my sheep, and you’re counted among those the Father has given to me.
