Well now, it turned out that Jesus told his disciples to rustle up some bread and wine for Him.
While they were off fetchin’ that grub, He told the crowd to sit themselves down on the ground.
When the disciples returned with the bread and wine, He took a piece of bread, broke it, blessed it, then handed it over to the disciples, tellin’ them to chow down.
After they had their fill, He told 'em to share with the crowd.
Then He told the disciples, “Look here, one of y’all's gonna get ordained, and I’ll give him the power to break bread, bless it, and serve it to my church folks—those who believe and get dunked in my name.”
And this here’s somethin’ you ought to keep doin’ just like I did, breakin’ bread, blessin’ it, and givin’ it to you.
You do this to remember my body, which I’ve shown ya. It’ll be a witness to the Father that you never forget me. And if you always keep me in mind, my Spirit will be with ya.
So, when He finished sayin' this, He told His disciples to take from the cup and drink, and to give to the crowd so they could drink up too.
And sure enough, they did just that and drank till they were full; then they served the crowd and everyone got filled up.
When the disciples finished this, Jesus told 'em: “You’re lucky for what you’ve done; this fulfills my commandments and shows the Father you’re willin’ to do what I asked.”
This is how you oughta treat those who turn their lives around and get baptized in my name; do it to remember my blood, which I spilled for ya, so you can witness to the Father you keep me in mind. And if you always remember me, my Spirit will be with ya.
Now, I’m givin’ you a command: keep doin’ these things. If you stick to ‘em, you’re blessed, 'cause you’re built on my rock.
But those among you who stray from this ain’t on solid ground, they’re on a shaky foundation, and when the rain comes down, and the floods rise, and the winds kick up, they’ll take a tumble, and the gates of hell will be wide open to welcome ‘em.
So you’re blessed if you keep my commandments, which the Father told me to share with ya.
Truly, I tell ya, you gotta watch and pray all the time, or the devil might lead you off the path.
Just like I prayed while I was with ya, you should pray in my church among the folks who repent and get baptized in my name. I’m the light, and I’ve set an example for ya.
And after sayin' all this to His disciples, He turned back to the crowd and said:
"Listen up, truly I say to you, keep watchin’ and prayin’ always, or you might fall into temptation; for Satan’s lookin' to nab ya, tryin’ to sift ya like wheat."
So you gotta pray to the Father in my name all the time;
And whatever you ask the Father in my name that’s right, believin’ you’ll get it, it’ll be given to you.
Pray with your families to the Father, always in my name, so your wives and children can be blessed.
And make sure to gather together often; don’t keep anyone from joinin' ya when you gather, but let 'em come and don’t turn 'em away;
Instead, pray for 'em and don’t push 'em out; if they come around often, pray for 'em to the Father, in my name.
So, light up your lamp so it can shine in this world. I'm the light you should hold up—just like what you saw me do. You witnessed me prayin’ to the Father.
And you see I’ve told y’all to stick together, not send anyone away, but to bring 'em to me so they can feel and see; just like you’ll do out in the world; anyone who breaks this command can find themselves in temptation.
Later, after sayin’ all this, Jesus looked at the chosen disciples and told 'em:
"Listen up, I’ve got another command for ya, and then I’ll be headin’ to my Father to fulfill some other commandments He’s given me.
Now, pay attention, here’s the command I’m givin’ ya: don’t let anyone partake of my flesh and blood unworthily when you minister it;
‘Cause anyone who eats and drinks my flesh and blood unworthily is bringin’ damnation on their own soul; so if you know a person ain’t worthy, keep them from eatin’ and drinkin’.
But don’t cast 'em out from among you, instead minister to ‘em and pray for ‘em to the Father, in my name; if they repent and get baptized in my name, you can welcome 'em back in and serve 'em my flesh and blood.
But if they don’t turn their lives around, they won’t be counted among my people, so they don’t go messin’ things up for ‘em, 'cause I know my sheep and I count 'em.
Still, don’t throw ‘em outta your gatherings or places of worship; you gotta keep ministerin’ to folks like that; you never know when they might come back, truly repent, and come to me with a full heart, and I’ll heal ‘em; you’ll be the means of bringin’ 'em to salvation.
So keep these words I’ve given ya so you don’t fall under condemnation; ‘cause woe to the one the Father sends down condemnation on.
I’m givin’ ya these commandments ‘cause of the fussin’ that’s been goin’ on among ya. Y’all are blessed if there’s no squabblin’ among ya.
Now I’m off to the Father, 'cause it’s best for me to go for your sakes.
Then when Jesus finished sayin’ all this, He touched each of the disciples He had chosen, one at a time, until He’d touched 'em all and spoke to 'em as He did.
And the crowd didn’t catch the words He said, so they couldn’t write it down; but the disciples did bear record that He gave 'em the power to pass on the Holy Ghost. And I’ll show ya later that this record's true.
Then, after He’d touched ‘em all, a cloud came and covered the crowd so they couldn’t see Jesus.
And while they were covered up, He left 'em, risin' up to heaven. And the disciples saw it and recorded that He ascended back into heaven.
