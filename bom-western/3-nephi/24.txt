Well, it happened that he told ‘em to jot down the words the Father had given to Malachi, which he was fixin' to share with ‘em. Once they got ‘em all penned, he explained ‘em real good. And these are the words he shared with ‘em, sayin’: The Father spoke to Malachi—Listen up, I’m sendin’ my messenger, and he’ll clear the path for me, and the Lord you’re lookin’ for will come quick to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant you all take delight in; yep, he’s comin’, says the Lord of Hosts.
But who’s gonna stand the day he shows up, and who can hold their ground when he reveals himself? For he’s like a blacksmith’s fire, and like the soap those folks use to clean clothes.
And he’ll take a seat like a goldsmith and cleaner of silver; he’ll clean up the sons of Levi, purgin’ ‘em like gold and silver, so they can make an offering to the Lord that’s right and true.
Then the offering from Judah and Jerusalem will be a joy to the Lord, just like back in the good ol’ days and yesteryear.
And I’ll step up close for the judgment; I’ll be a quick witness against the sorcerers, the adulterers, the liars, and those who cheat the laborers outta their pay, the widows and the orphans, and those who turn away strangers, not givin’ a hoot about me, says the Lord of Hosts.
For I’m the Lord, and I don’t change; that’s why you sons of Jacob ain’t burnt to a crisp.
For long as your daddy’s been kickin’, y’all have turned away from my laws and haven’t kept ‘em. Come back to me, and I’ll come back to you, says the Lord of Hosts. But y’all ask: How in tarnation shall we return?
Can a fella steal from God? Yep, and y’all have done it. But you ask: How’d we rob ya? By not givin’ your tithes and offerings.
You’re cursed with a curse ‘cause you done robbed me, this whole nation of ya.
Bring all them tithes into the storehouse, so there’ll be plenty to eat in my house; and now just try me on this, says the Lord of Hosts, see if I won’t throw wide open the windows of heaven and pour you out so many blessings you won’t have room to hold ‘em.
And I’ll put a stop to the critters that devour your crops for your sake, and they won’t ruin the fruits of your land; and your grapevines won’t drop their fruit ‘fore it’s ripe in the fields, says the Lord of Hosts.
And all the nations will call you lucky, for you’ll be a land that’s a-glisten, says the Lord of Hosts.
Your words have been mighty strong against me, says the Lord. Yet you’re askin’: What in the world have we said against you?
You’ve said: Ain’t no point in servin' God, and what’s it worth keepin’ his laws and walkin’ all sad-like before the Lord of Hosts?
And now we’re callin’ the proud folks happy; yep, them who do wrong are lifted up; even those who dare God find themselves bein’ delivered.
Then them who feared the Lord chatted often with one another, and the Lord listened and took note; and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and pondered his name.
And they’ll be mine, says the Lord of Hosts, on that day when I gather up my jewels; and I’ll spare ‘em like a father spares his own son that serves him.
Then you’ll return and know the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the one that serves God and the one that don’t.
