Well, it was like this: when Jesus rode off to the great beyond, the folks all scattered, each man grabbin' his wife and kids and headin' back to their own homesteads.
Word spread like wildfire 'fore the stars even twinkled that a whole heap of folks had laid eyes on Jesus, and that he had tended to 'em, sayin' he'd be back again come the mornin’ for another visit.
Sure enough, all through the night, folks kept yammerin’ ‘bout Jesus, and the buzz got so loud that plenty of ’em, a good ol’ crowd, busted their humps all night long to be in the right spot come dawn when Jesus would show his face again.
Next mornin’ rolled ‘round, and the crowd had huddled up real tight. There stood Nephi and his brother, the one he had raised from the dead, a fella named Timothy, plus his boy, Jonas, and Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, along with Kumen, Kumenonhi, Jeremiah, Shemnon, Jonas, Zedekiah, and Isaiah—all names of the disciples Jesus had picked out. They stepped up right in the middle of that big ol’ crowd.
Well, the crowd got so large they had to break ‘em up into twelve groups.
Those twelve started teachin' the bunch, and they got everyone kneelin' down flat on the dirt to pray to the Father in Jesus’ name.
Them disciples also prayed to the Father in Jesus’ name. Then they got back on their feet and went about helpin’ folks out.
Once they shared the same words Jesus had given ‘em—'nothin’ different from what he said—they knelt down again and prayed to the Father in Jesus’ name.
They prayed for what they most hankered for; they wanted the Holy Ghost to come down on ‘em.
When they finished prayin’, they waded on down to the water’s edge, and the crowd trailed right behind.
Then along comes Nephi, settlin’ into the water to get baptized.
He popped up outta the water and started baptismin’, takin' on everyone Jesus had chosen.
Lo and behold, once everyone was baptized and emerged from the water, the Holy Ghost swooped down on ‘em, fillin’ 'em up with spirit and fire.
And there they were, wrapped up like they were in flames; the heavens opened, and the crowd beheld it all, givin' their word; angels dropped down from the sky and ministered to 'em.
While the angels were tendin’ to the disciples, Jesus himself showed up and stood amongst 'em, ministerin’ too.
Then he told the crowd to kneel down once more on the ground, and he asked his disciples to do the same.
When they all were kneelin’, he told his disciples to pray.
And sure enough, they started prayin’, callin’ him their Lord and God.
Then it came to pass that Jesus stepped back a bit, bowin’ down to the ground, and said:
Father, I’m mighty grateful you’ve given the Holy Ghost to the ones I’ve chosen; it’s ‘cause they believe in me that I picked ‘em from the wild.
Father, I reckon and pray you’ll bestow the Holy Ghost on anyone who believes in their words.
Father, you've granted them the Holy Ghost ‘cause they trust in me; you see they believe in me ‘cause they call out to me in prayer, and they do so ‘cause I’m right there with ‘em.
Now, Father, I’m askin’ you for them, and for all who’ll believe in their words, that they might come to believe in me so I can dwell in ‘em like you, Father, dwell in me, so we can be one.
And after Jesus prayed like that, he made his way back to his disciples, and lo and behold, they kept prayin' without stoppin'; they didn’t ramble on too much, for the words of prayer were given to them, and their hearts were full of want.
And it came to pass that Jesus blessed ‘em while they prayed, and his smile shone upon ‘em, and the light of his countenance lit ‘em up; they looked as bright as the very garments of Jesus, outshinin' anything on this earth.
Then Jesus told ‘em, Keep on prayin’; and sure enough, they didn’t let up on their prayers.
He stepped away again, bowin’ down to the earth, and prayed to the Father again, sayin’:
Father, I’m grateful you’ve cleaned up those I’ve picked, ‘cause of their faith, and I pray for ‘em, and for those who will believe through their words, so they can be purified in me, like they are made clean through me.
Father, I’m not prayin’ for the whole wide world, but for the ones you’ve given me from the world, ‘cause of their faith, that they might be made pure in me, so I can be in ‘em as you, Father, are in me, so we can be one, and I can be glorified in them.
And when Jesus had finished sayin’ all that, he returned to his disciples, and behold, they were prayin’ hard, not takin’ a break; and once again, he smiled at ‘em, and they shone bright as the sun, just like Jesus.
And it came to pass he stepped away, prayin’ to the Father again;
And words can’t capture the prayers he prayed, no human hand can write ‘em down.
And the crowd heard and took note of it; their hearts opened wide, and they understood in their souls the prayers he spoke.
Yet, the words he prayed were so grand and marvelous that they can’t be penned or spoken by man.
And it came to pass that when Jesus wrapped up his prayer, he came back to his disciples and said: I ain't never seen such faith in all my days amongst the Jews; that's why I couldn’t show ‘em such great wonders, due to their lack of belief.
I tell ya, there ain't none of ‘em who’ve seen such wondrous things like you’ve seen; neither have they heard things as marvelous as what you've heard.
