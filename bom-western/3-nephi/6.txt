Well now, it sure came to pass that the folks of the Nephites all made their way back to their own homesteads in the twenty-sixth year, every man, along with his kin, his critters and his stock, his horses and cattle, and everything else that was his.
And it came to be that they didn’t chow down all their grub; so they packed up all the fixin’s they hadn’t gobbled up, all kinds of grain, their gold, their silver, and all their precious possessions, and they rode back to their lands and holdings, both in the north and the south, across the land up yonder and down yonder.
And they gave a nod to them robbers who promised to keep the peace and wished to stick with bein’ Lamanites, divvying up lands based on their numbers, so they’d have somethin’ to work with to survive; thereby, they set up peace all through the territory.
And they started prospering again, growin’ in strength; the twenty-sixth and seventh years rolled on by, and there was a heap of order in the land; they laid down their laws built on fairness and justice.
Now, there wasn’t a thing under the sun to hold the folks back from keepin’ on prosperin’, except if they strayed into mischief.
And it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, along with those chosen leaders, who brought about this mighty peace in the land.
And it came to pass that a batch of new towns were built up, and plenty of old towns got fixed up real nice.
There were numerous roads laid down, and many trails blazed, leadin’ from town to town, from land to land, and from one spot to another.
And just like that, the twenty-eighth year slipped away, and the folks had peace without end.
But come the twenty-ninth year, some squabblin’ started up among the folks; and some folks got all puffed up with pride and boastfulness 'cause of their mighty fine fortunes, yes, leadin' to all manner of persecutions;
For there were a whole mess of merchants in the land, plus plenty of lawyers and officials too.
And folks started bein’ set apart by their rank, dependin’ on their riches and their chances to learn; sure enough, some folks were left in ignorance due to their lack of funds, while others received a heap of learnin’ on account of their wealth.
Some got all haughty, while others stayed humble; some folks shot back with jeers for every jeer they took, while others just took it all in stride, facing hardships without fightin’ back, humbled and repentant before God.
And so an awful big inequality took root in the land, to the point that the church started falling apart; by the thirtieth year, the church was all but gone, except for a few Lamanites who had found the true faith; and they wouldn’t be shaken loose, bein’ steady, steadfast, and unmovable, eager to keep the Lord’s commandments.
Now the reason for all this mischief among the folks was plain as day—Satan had a stronghold, stirrin’ the people to commit all sorts of wrongdoing, puffin’ them up with pride, temptin’ ‘em to lust after power, authority, riches, and all the empty trinkets of the world.
And just like that, Satan led the hearts of the folks astray to commit all kinds of wickedness; thus, they had but a few years of peace.
And so, as the thirtieth year dawned—folks had been tossed around for a long time by the devil’s temptations, followin’ wherever he led, doin’ whatever dark deeds he dang well pleased—and thus at the start of this thirtieth year, they found themselves in a sorry state of wickedness.
Now, they weren’t clueless about their sins, for they knew what God wanted from them, for it had been laid out for ‘em; thus, they chose to rebel against God willingly.
And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, son of Lachoneus, for he filled his dad’s boots and ran the show that year.
And there started showin’ up men inspired from high above, sent to preach among the people all over the land, boldly speakin’ out about the sins and wrongdoings of the folks, and givin’ testimony about the redemption the Lord had planned for His people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they spoke up fiercely about his death and sufferin’.
Now many folks got downright furious at those who talked about these matters; and the ones who were mad were mostly the chief judges, and those who had worn the robes of high priests and lawyers; yes, all them legal beagles were angrier than a bull in a china shop at those who spoke up.
Now no lawyer, judge, or high priest had the right to condemn a soul to death unless their sentence was signed off by the governor of the land.
Now a whole passel of those bold witnesses to Christ were taken and put to death in secret by the judges, and the word of their fate didn’t make it to the governor until after they passed on.
Now, behold, this was against the laws of the land, to put a man to death without a nod from the governor—
So, a complaint reached the land of Zarahemla, knockin’ at the door of the governor, agin’ them judges who had condemned the prophets of the Lord to die, not followin’ the law.
Now it came to pass that these judges were brought up before the judge, to reckon for the crime they had done, in accordance with the laws agreed upon by the folks.
Now it came to pass that them judges had a heap of friends and kinfolk; and most everyone, even almost all them lawyers and high priests, gathered together, uniting with the relatives of them judges who were to be tried by the law.
And they entered into a secret pact one with another, to bind themselves together in that old covenant, which was handed down by them of old, a covenant that was cooked up by the devil, to band together against all that’s right.
So they teamed up against the people of the Lord, entering into a pact to wipe them out, and to save those folks guilty of murder from the clutches of justice, which was fixin’ to be brought down according to the law.
And they openly scoffed at the law and the rights of their land; they conspired with one another to finish off the governor, and to set a king over the land, so that the land would no longer enjoy freedom but be under the thumb of kings.
