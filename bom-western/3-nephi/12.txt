And it happened that after Jesus had shared these words with good ol' Nephi and the others he'd rounded up (which, by the way, numbered twelve fellas who were given the power and authority to dunk folks), He raised His hand to the crowd and hollered: Y’all are mighty blessed if you tune in to the words of these twelve I’ve picked out to serve you as your guides and helpers; I’ve given ‘em the right to baptize you in water, and once you’ve been dunked in that water, I’ll be coming back to set you ablaze with fire and the Holy Ghost; so, you’re especially blessed if you believe in me and get baptized after you’ve laid your eyes on me and know that I am who I claim to be.
And looky here, even more blessed are those who put their faith in your words ‘cause you’ll be telling folks you seen me and that you know I'm the real deal. Yep, blessed are those who trust what you say, who humbly step down into that chilly water for a dunk, ‘cause they’re gonna be visited with fire and the Holy Ghost, and their sins will be washed clean.
Yep, blessed are the folks who are humble in spirit and come up to me, ‘cause the kingdom of heaven belongs to ‘em.
And, once more, blessed are all the sad souls, ‘cause they’re gonna find comfort.
And blessed are the gentle folks, for they’re gonna inherit the land.
And blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, for they will be filled up with the Holy Ghost.
Blessed are the kind-hearted, for they’re gonna be shown kindness in return.
And blessed are the pure of heart, for they’ll get to lay eyes on God.
And blessed are the peace-makers, for they’ll be known as children of God.
And blessed are those who catch a rough time ‘cause of my name; the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
And blessed are you when folks give you a hard time, throw stones at you, and say all sorts of nasty lies about you just because you believe in me;
For you’ll find great joy and be downright happy, for you’ve got a big ol' reward waiting for you up in heaven; ‘cause that’s how they treated the prophets who came before you.
Listen up, I’m tellin’ you true, I want you to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how’s it gonna spice things up? It’ll be no good for nothing but to be tossed out and stomped on by the feet of folks.
I’m telling you true, I want you to be the light for this people. A town set on a hill can’t be hidden.
Now, do folks light a lantern and shove it under a basket? Nope, they place it on a stand so it can light up the whole house;
So let your light shine for all to see your good deeds and praise your Father up in heaven.
Don’t go thinking I’m here to do away with the law or the prophets. Nope, I’m here to fulfill ‘em;
For verily I say to you, not a single jot or tittle has passed away from the law, it’s all been completed in me.
And look here, I’ve handed you the laws and commandments of my Father: you’re to have faith in me, turn away from your misdeeds, and come to me with a broken heart and a sprightly spirit. Know this, the commandments are laid out before you, and the law is fulfilled.
So come on over to me and be saved; for truly I’m telling you, unless you keep my commandments which I’ve given you right now, you won’t be making it into the kingdom of heaven.
You’ve heard the folks of old say, it’s written, "Thou shalt not kill," and whoever does kill is in for God’s judgment;
But I’m telling you, whoever’s mad at his brother is also in for judgment. And if anyone calls his brother a fool, he’s in trouble with the council; and saying, "Thou fool," puts you in hot water with hellfire.
So, if you’re on your way to me and remember your brother’s got beef with you—
Head on over to your brother, make things right with him first, and then come to me with a full heart, and I’ll take you in.
Settle with your opponent quick while you’re on the path together, ‘cause if you don’t, he might just rope you in and you’ll end up locked up.
I’m tellin’ you true, you won’t be getting out of there ‘til you’ve paid every last penny. And while you’re behind bars, can you pay even one little penny? Nope, I’m telling you, no way.
Now listen, it’s written that you ought not commit adultery;
But I’m saying, whoever looks at a woman with lust in his heart has already gone and committed adultery.
Here’s a commandment for ya: don’t let any of this creep into your heart;
It’s better to hold back from those desires and carry your cross than to end up in hell.
It’s also been said, if you’re gonna put away your wife, you need to give her a certificate of divorce.
Now I’m telling you true, whoever puts away his wife without a good reason like infidelity causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries her after she’s been tossed out is committing adultery too.
And again it’s written, no swearing oaths, but be good to your word to the Lord;
But I’m telling you, don’t swear at all; not by heaven, it’s God’s throne;
Nor by the earth, for it’s His footstool;
And don’t swear by your head, ‘cause you can’t change one hair from black to white;
Just let your yes be yes, and your no be no; anything beyond that’s just plain evil.
And lo, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
But I say unto you, don’t hit back when someone wrongs you; if someone whacks you on your right cheek, turn to them the other one too;
And if someone takes you to court and wants to take your coat, hand over your cloak as well;
And if anyone forces you to walk a mile, you might as well walk two with 'em.
Give to those who ask of you, and don’t turn away those lookin’ to borrow.
And it’s also written, love your neighbor and hate your enemy;
But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who give you trouble, do good for those who despise you, and pray for folks who mistreat and harass you;
So you can be the children of your Father up in heaven; ‘cause He lets His sun shine on the good and the bad alike.
So, everything from the old days that was under the law, it’s all been wrapped up in me.
Old times have passed, and everything’s fresh and new.
So I reckon you oughta aim to be perfect just like me, or your Father in heaven is perfect.
