Well now, listen up, partner, 'cause a day’s a-comin’ that’ll burn hotter than a blacksmith’s forge; them proud folks and all them scallywags are gonna end up as nothing but burnt weeds. That day’s gonna scorch 'em real good, just like the Good Lord's reckonin’.
But for them who give a hoot about my name, the Son of Righteousness is gonna rise up with a heap of healing under his wings; y’all will trot outta the stalls and grow up strong like young calves.
And you’ll be stompin’ on them wicked ones; come that day, they’ll be nothin’ but dust under your boots, says the Lord of Hosts.
Don’t forget the law of Moses, my good ol’ servant, which I laid down for him up on Horeb for all of Israel, with all the rules and reckonin's.
Now listen here, I’m fixin’ to send you Elijah the prophet before that big ol’ dreadful day of the Lord hits.
He’s gonna turn the hearts of the folks back to their kinfolk, and the kinfolk back to their folks, or else I’ll come along and lay a heavy curse on this here earth.
