Well now, let’s ride through these words in a way fit for the frontier folk:
The good Lord rustles up bread and wine straight from nothin’, and he serves up the sacrament to the crowd—Folks from Jacob’s kin are gonna find the Lord their God and stake their claim in these here Americas—Jesus is a prophet just like Moses, and the Nephites are the offspring of them prophets—Others from the Lord’s lot will round up in Jerusalem. 'Bout A.D. 34.
And it came to pass that he told the crowd to hush up their prayers for a spell, and he told his disciples the same. And he said they oughta keep prayin’ in their hearts.
And he told ‘em to get on up and stand tall. And they all stood up on their own two feet.
Then he took some bread once more, broke it, blessed it, and passed it ‘round for the disciples to munch on.
Once they had their fill, he told ‘em to break some bread and pass it out to the crowd.
And after they had handed out the bread, he also handed ‘em wine, tellin’ ‘em to share that with the folks too.
Now, keep in mind, there was no bread or wine brought along by the disciples, nor by the folks at the gathering;
But he truly set before ‘em bread to chew on, and wine to sip.
And he said to ‘em: Whoever chomps on this bread is takin’ a bite from my body for their soul; and whoever drinks this wine is sippin’ my blood for their spirit; and their soul will never be hungry or thirsty again, but will be satisfied.
Now, when all the crowd had eaten and drank, heck, they were filled with the Spirit; they raised their voices in unison, givin’ glory to Jesus, whom they both saw and heard.
And when they had all sung praises to Jesus, he spoke to ‘em: Now, I’m wrapping up the task that the Father set for me regarding this people, who are some of Israel’s kin.
Y’all remember when I told ya, that when the words of Isaiah come true—well, you can find ‘em written down, so take a look—
And I tell ya true, that when they are fulfilled, it’ll mark the completion of the promise that the Father made to his people, O house of Israel.
Then the scattered remains, which roam the earth, will be rounded up from the east, the west, the south, and the north; and they’ll come to know the Lord their God, who has saved ‘em.
And the Father has given me the task to hand you this land, as your rightful claim.
And I’m tellin’ ya, if them Gentiles don’t mend their ways after the blessings they’ll receive, after they’ve sent my people adrift—
Then you, who are of Jacob’s line, will ride among ‘em; you'll be right in the thick of it with a whole lotta folks, and you’ll be as fierce as a lion among the critters of the wild, and as a young lion among the sheep—to whom, if he charges through, he’ll crush and tear apart, and no one can save ‘em.
Your hand will be raised against your foes, and all your enemies will be cut off.
And I aim to gather my folks like a farmer gathers his sheaves in the barn.
For I’ll make my people, with whom the Father has struck a deal, strong as iron and tough as brass. And you’ll bring down many a foe; their spoils, I’ll dedicate to the Lord, and everything that they hold dear to the Lord of all the land. And behold, I’m the one who makes it happen.
And it will come to pass, says the Father, that the sword of my justice will hang over ‘em on that day; and unless they repent, it’ll fall on ‘em, says the Father, yes indeed, even on all the nations of the Gentiles.
And it will come to pass that I’ll set my people firm, O house of Israel.
And behold, I will set this people up in this land, to fulfill the promise I made to your father Jacob; and it’ll be a New Jerusalem. The powers of heaven will be right in the middle of this people; indeed, I’ll be in the midst of ya.
Behold, I’m the one Moses spoke about, sayin’: A prophet will the Lord your God raise up from among your kin, like me; you oughta listen to him in all things he says. And it’ll come to pass that whoever doesn’t listen to that prophet will be cut off from the folks.
I truly say to ya, yeah, and all the prophets from Samuel onward, whoever spoke, testified of me.
And behold, you’re the children of them prophets; and you’re of the house of Israel; and you’ve got the covenant the Father made with your forebears, when he spoke to Abraham: And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
The Father raised me up for ya first, and sent me to bless ya by turnin’ each and every one of ya away from your wicked ways; and this is ‘cause ya are the children of the promise—
And after ya received your blessings, then the Father’s promise made with Abraham will be fulfilled, sayin’: In your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed—with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, and that blessing on the Gentiles will make ‘em strong as all get-out, for the scatterin’ of my people, O house of Israel.
And they’ll be a scourge to the folks of this land. Nevertheless, when they’ve received the fullness of my gospel, if they harden their hearts against me, I’ll bring their wrongs back on their own heads, says the Father.
And I’ll keep my promise to my people; I’ve covenanted with ‘em that I’d wrangle ‘em together in my own good time, givin’ ‘em back the land of their fathers as their heritage, which is the land of Jerusalem, a promised land for ‘em forever, says the Father.
And it will come to pass that the time will come when the fullness of my gospel will be preached to ‘em;
And they’ll believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and pray to the Father in my name.
Then their watchmen will raise their voices, and together they’ll sing; for they’ll see eye to eye.
Then the Father will gather ‘em again, and hand ‘em Jerusalem for the land of their inheritance.
Then they’ll break out into joy—Sing along, ye desolate spots of Jerusalem; for the Father has brought comfort to his people, he’s redeemed Jerusalem.
The Father has bared his holy arm for all the nations to see; and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of the Father; for the Father and I are one.
And then it’ll come to pass what’s been written: Wake up, wake up again, and put on your strength, O Zion; put on your fine duds, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for from now on, the uncircumcised and the unclean won’t be comin’ into you anymore.
Shake off the dust; rise up and sit down, O Jerusalem; free yourself from the chains ‘round your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
For thus says the Lord: You’ve sold yourselves for nothing, and you’ll be redeemed without cost.
Truly, truly, I say to ya, my people will know my name; yeah, in that day they’ll recognize that I’m the one speakin’.
Then they’ll say: How beautiful are the feet on the mountains of him who brings good news, who shares peace; who brings good tidings of joy, that tells Zion: Your God reigns!
And then a shout will ring out: Get on out, get on out from there, don’t touch what’s unclean; leave that place behind; be clean, you who carry the vessels of the Lord.
For you won’t be rushin’ out in a hurry or flightin’; for the Lord will lead the way, and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
Behold, my servant will act wisely; he’ll be lifted up, honored, and exceedingly high.
Just like many folks were shocked at you—his appearance was so marred, more than any man, and his form more than the son of men—
So he’ll sprinkle many nations; kings will shut their traps at him, for what they hadn’t been told, they’ll see; and what they hadn’t heard, they’ll consider.
Truly, truly, I say to you, all these things will surely come, just like the Father has commanded me. Then this promise that the Father has made with his people will be fulfilled; and then Jerusalem will be once more inhabited by my people, and it’ll be their land of inheritance.
