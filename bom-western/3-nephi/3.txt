Well now, it came to pass that in the sixteenth year since the good Lord rode into town, Lachoneus, the big boss of the land, got a letter from the head honcho of a bunch of rascally bandits; and here’s what he had a mind to say:
“Lachoneus, the top dog and chief governor of this here territory, let me tell ya, I’m tipping my hat to ya for bein’ so sturdy and steadfast in holdin’ onto what you reckon is your right and freedom; shoot, you stand tall like you got the Good Lord himself backin’ ya up in your fight for your liberty, your goods, and your home, or whatever you reckon that might be.
Now, I can’t help but feel sorry for you, mighty Lachoneus, for bein’ foolish enough to think you can stand up to a heap of brave hombres under my command, who are all ready and waitin’ with their guns cocked, just itching for the order to ride down on the Nephites and wipe ‘em out.
I know the iron will of those men, I’ve seen ‘em in action, and their hatred for ya runs deeper than a river in flood ‘cause of all the wrongs you’ve done ‘em. If they come down on ya, it’ll be pure devastation.
So I put quill to parchment, sealin’ it with my own hand, hopin' for your well-being ‘cause I do admire your fightin’ spirit in what ya believe is right, and your brave heart in the heat of battle.
So here’s the deal: I’d like you to just hand over your towns, your land, and all your stuff to my folks, instead of waitin’ for ‘em to come down hard with the sword and bring ruin upon ya.
Or in simpler terms, give yourselves up to us, team up with us, learn our secret ways, and be our kin—not our drudges, but our partners in all we own.
And I swear by my boots, if you do this, you won’t be wiped out; but if you don’t, I’m swearin’ right here that by tomorrow month, I’ll send my armies down upon ya, not lifting a finger to spare ya, slaughterin’ ya till none are left.
And I’m Giddianhi; I’m the governor of the secret gang of Gadianton; I know our group and what we do is as solid as a rock, and it’s been passed down through the ages.
I’m sendin’ this letter to you, Lachoneus, hopin' you'll hand over your territory and belongings without blood bein’ spilled, so my folks can reclaim their rights and their government, which you've taken from 'em 'cause of your wickedness, and if you don’t, I’ll make sure they get their revenge. I am Giddianhi.
Now, when Lachoneus got hold of that letter, he was as astonished as a cat in a dog fight, not just at Giddianhi’s nerve in askin’ for the Nephites' land but also for threatenin’ the folks and seekin’ revenge on them who hadn’t really done wrong, except for strayin’ off to those vile scoundrels.
This Lachoneus, the governor, was a fair man and didn’t scare easy from a bandit’s threats; so he didn’t pay no mind to Giddianhi’s words, but instead got his people to pray to the Lord for strength when them bandits would come down.
You bet, he sent out a call for everyone to gather up their womenfolk, their young’uns, their livestock, and all their goods, ‘cept for their land, to one place.
And he ordered some fortifications to be built ‘round ‘em, and they were strong enough to stop a bull moose. He also made sure there were armies, both Nephites and Lamanites, or everyone lumped in as Nephites, set up as guards ‘round the clock to keep an eye out for them bandits.
He said to ‘em: As the Lord lives, unless you turn from your sins and cry out to Him, you won’t stand a chance against those Gadianton scallywags.
And the words and prophecies from Lachoneus were so powerful they sent shivers through all the folks, who worked mighty hard to follow his lead.
So it came to pass that Lachoneus put chief captains over all the Nephite armies to lead ‘em when the bandits came climbing down from the wild.
Now, the biggest chief of all the captains and the head honcho of the Nephite armies was given the title, and his name was Gidgiddoni.
Now, it was the custom among the Nephites to pick their top captains (unless they were in one of their darker moments) as someone who had the spirit of prophecy and revelation; so, Gidgiddoni was a mighty prophet among ‘em, just like the head judge.
So the folks say to Gidgiddoni: Pray to the Lord, and let’s hightail it up to the mountains and into the wild, so we can ambush those bandits and wipe ‘em out on their own turf.
But Gidgiddoni answered them: The Lord wouldn’t take kindly to that; if we go after ‘em, the Lord might just hand us over to ‘em; so we’ll stay put in the heart of our land, gather all our armies, and instead of goin’ after them, we’ll wait for ‘em to come to us; so as the Lord lives, if we do this right, He’ll put ‘em right in our sights.
In the seventeenth year, towards the end of the year, Lachoneus's call had spread far and wide, and they’d brought their horses, chariots, cattle, along with their flocks and every last bit of their goods, marchin’ in the thousands to the spot they were told to huddle together to stand against the adversaries.
That chosen spot was the land of Zarahemla, and the stretch between Zarahemla and Bountiful, all the way to the border ‘twixt Bountiful and the land of Desolation.
There were a mighty lot of thousands who called themselves Nephites that gathered in that territory. Lachoneus made sure they all grouped together in the south ‘cause the northern lands were cursed.
They fortified their defenses against their foes, settlin’ in one location, as one unit, and they were spooked by the words from Lachoneus, enough so that they repented of their past wrongdoings, and they raised their prayers to the Lord their God, askin’ for deliverance when their enemies would rise up against ‘em for battle.
They felt a heavy sorrow due to their enemies. And Gidgiddoni made sure they were makin’ strong weapons for war, outfittin’ ‘em with armor, shields, and bucklers, just as he instructed.
