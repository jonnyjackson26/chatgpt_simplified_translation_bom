Jesus tells ya: Don’t judge folks; ask the Good Lord; watch out for the fake prophets—He promises salvation to them that do the will of the Father—Compare with Matthew 7. 'Bout A.D. 34.
So there came a time when Jesus finished talkin’, He turned back to the crowd, opened his mouth, and said: Truly, I’m tellin’ ya, don’t judge, or you’ll be judged yourself.
‘Cause however ya judge others, that’s how you’re gonna be judged; and whatever measure you use, you’ll get measured back the same way.
And why are ya lookin’ at that speck in your brother’s eye, but you don’t notice the log jammed in your own?
Or how’re ya gonna say to your brother: Let me take that speck outta yer eye—when there’s a log sittin' in your own?
You hypocrite, first pull that log outta your own eye, then you’ll be able to see clear enough to help your brother with his speck.
Don’t be givin’ what’s holy to the mutts, and don’t toss your pearls before pigs, or they’ll stomp on ‘em and come back to tear you up.
Ask, and you’ll get it; seek, and you’ll find; knock, and the door’ll be swung wide open for ya.
‘Cause anyone who asks, gets; and the one who's searchin' finds; and to the one that knocks, it’ll be opened up.
Which one of ya fathers, if your boy asks for bread, would give him a rock instead?
Or if he asks for a fish, would ya give him a snake?
If you scoundrels know how to give good gifts to your young’uns, how much more will your Father up in heaven give good things to those who ask him?
So, all the things you’d want folks to do for ya, you should do the same for ‘em, ‘cause that’s the law and the prophets.
Come on through that narrow gate; ‘cause the wide gate is easy and the road is broad that leads to ruin, and many a cowboy takes that path;
But the gate’s narrow and the way is tight that leads to life, and not many will find it.
Keep an eye out for them false prophets, who come lookin’ like sheep, but inside they’re wolves lookin’ to feast.
You’ll know ‘em by their fruits. Do folks pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?
Same goes for every good tree bearin’ good fruit; but a bad tree produces rotten fruit.
A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a corrupt tree can’t bring forth good fruit.
Every tree that don’t bear good fruit gets chopped down and tossed in the fire.
So, by their fruits, you’ll know ‘em.
Not everyone who hollers at me, Lord, Lord, will make it into the kingdom of heaven; but only the one who does what my Father in heaven wants.
Many will come to me on that day, sayin’: Lord, Lord, didn’t we prophesy in your name, and cast out devils, and perform all sorts of wonders?
And then I’ll tell ‘em straight: I never knew ya; get away from me, you workers of wickedness.
Therefore, whoever hears my words and puts ‘em into action, I’ll liken ‘em to a wise fella who built his house on solid rock—
And the rain poured down, and the floods rose, and the winds blew, and slammed against that house; but it didn’t fall, ‘cause it was built on rock.
But everyone who hears my words and doesn’t follow ‘em is like a fool who built his house on sand—
And the rain poured down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat against that house; and it fell with a mighty crash.
