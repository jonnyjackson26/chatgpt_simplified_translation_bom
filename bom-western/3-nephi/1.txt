Third Nephi
The Book of Nephi the Son of Nephi, Who Was the Son of Helaman
Well now, Helaman was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was the son of Alma, bein' kin to Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, that feller who high-tailed it outta Jerusalem back in the year one when Zedekiah was sittin' on the throne as king of Judah.
Nephi, Helaman's boy, rides outta them parts, leavin' his eldest, also named Nephi, in charge of keepin' track of the records—While strange omens and marvels fill the air, the no-gooders plot to take out the good folks—Then comes the night when Christ makes His entrance—A sign gets tossed out, and a brand-new star lights up the sky—Lies and trickery spread like wildfire, and the Gadianton bandits do plenty of harm. This all happened ‘round A.D. 1 to 4.
So it was that the ninety and first year was history and it had been six hundred years since Lehi skedaddled outta Jerusalem; it was the year when Lachoneus was the big cheese, the chief judge and governor over the land.
Now, Nephi, son of Helaman, had headed outta the land of Zarahemla, tellin’ his eldest son Nephi to mind the brass plates and all them records they’d been keepin’, along with all those sacred bits since Lehi took off from Jerusalem.
Then that feller took off from the land, and where he went, not a soul knows; but his son Nephi kept all them records on the down low, yes-siree, the record of the folks.
In the start of the ninety and second year, the prophecies of the prophets started to unfold more like a wildflower; greater signs and even bigger miracles started happenin’ among the townsfolk.
But some varmints began to say the time for Sam's words to come true had come and gone.
They started smirking at their fellow townsfolk, sayin’: "Look here, the time’s past, and Sam’s words didn’t come to nothin'; therefore, y'all's joy and faith over this ain’t worth a nickel.”
Well, you can bet they made quite a ruckus all over the land; the folks who believed started feelin' low, worried that them things which had been spoken might not happen after all.
But lo and behold, they kept their eyes peeled for that day and that night and that day which should be as one long stretch without no night, hopin' to prove their faith was still good.
Now it so happened that the skeptics set a day when all believers in those ol' traditions oughta be put to the noose, 'less the sign Sam spoke of showed up.
So when Nephi, good ol’ Helaman's son, caught wind of this wickedness among his kin, his heart was downright heavy.
And he went out, dropped to his knees in the dirt, and hollered earnestly to his God for the folks, yeah, them folks fixin' to be wiped out ‘cause they believed in their folks’ ancient traditions.
He kept callin' out to the Lord all day; and sure enough, the Lord’s voice reached his ears, sayin’:
"Hitch up yer chin and cheer up; for the time's nigh, and tonight the sign will come, and come mornin', I’m ridin' into this world to show everyone I’m keepin' all them promises made by my holy prophets."
"Look here, I'm comin’ to my own, to fulfill every last bit of what I laid out for the children of men since the dawn of time, doin' the will of both the Father and the Son—'cause of me for the Father, and 'cause of my human side for the Son. And mark my words, the time's nigh for that sign."
And sure enough, those words for Nephi came to pass, just like they said; ‘cause when the sun dipped down, there was no darkness; and folks were left in awe ‘cause when night fell, it was light as day.
Many who'd scoffed at the prophets got knocked to the ground like they was dead, ‘cause they figured out that the big plan to take out the believers was blowin' up in their faces; the sign they’d been waitin' on was already a reality.
And they started to realize that the Son of God was ‘bout to show himself; in fact, from the far reaches of the earth, from west to east, in both the north and the south, folks were so flabbergasted they hit the dirt.
They figured out the prophets had been yappin' about this for years, and that sign was already here; they started to feel jitters ‘cause of their wicked ways and doubting hearts.
And that night there was no darkness at all, it was as bright as a high noon sun. Come morning, the sun got up like usual; they knew in their bones it was the day the Lord would be born, all thanks to the sign given.
And it all came to pass, every last bit, just like the prophets said.
Then a new star popped up, just like the word foretold.
Right after that, ol’ Satan started sendin’ lies among the townsfolk, tryin' to harden their hearts so they wouldn’t believe them signs and wonders they seen; but in spite of those fibs, most folks still believed and turned to the Lord.
Then Nephi struck out among the folks, along with many others, baptizin’ ‘em into repentance, makin’ way for a heap of forgiveness. And so, peace started to settle back in the land.
Not much fussin' went on, ‘cept for a few who started preachin’, tryin’ to prove through scripture that it wasn’t necessary to stick with the law of Moses. Now in this here matter they went astray, not understandin’ their scriptures.
But before long, they were convinced of their wrong turn and realized the law wasn’t done away with just yet—it had to be fulfilled all the way; word came to ‘em that it had to all happen; not a single jot or tittle would slip away till it was all taken care of; so this same year, they got wise to their mistakes and fessed up to their wrongs.
And that ninety and second year rolled by, bringin’ good news to the folks 'cause of them signs which came to be like the holy prophets prophesied.
The ninety and third year drifted on by peacefully, ‘cept for them pesky Gadianton robbers, hidin' out in the hills, causin' trouble; their strongholds and secret spots were too tough for the folks to overcome, which led to many murders and a heap of slaughter among the good folks.
Then come the ninety and fourth year, those villains started to grow in numbers 'cause lots of Nephite dissenters ran to ‘em, makin' it real hard for those Nephites still in the land.
And the Lamanites had their troubles too; they had plenty of young'uns growin’ up tough, but got led astray by some Zoramites, who lured ‘em in with their sweet talk to join the Gadianton robbers.
Thus, the Lamanites suffered too, watchin’ their faith and righteousness dwindle due to the wickedness of the up-and-comin' generation.
