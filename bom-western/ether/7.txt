Orihah was the top dog, runnin’ things right in the wild west of his land. There was plenty of rough and tumble with rival gangs, Shule and Cohor, settin’ up their own territories. Prophets were hollerin’ about the wicked ways and false gods of the folks, who then saw the light and turned their lives ‘round.
And it came to pass that Orihah was fair and square with his judgments, keepin’ the peace long as he was around, and that was a heap of years.
He had himself a whole pack of thirty-one young’uns—twenty-three boys among ‘em.
And it came to pass he had another boy named Kib when he was gettin’ on in years. Kib took the reins after him, and he went and had himself a boy named Corihor.
Now when Corihor hit the age of thirty-two, he turned his back on his old man and hightailed it to that land called Nehor, where he had a bunch of handsome youngsters, drawin’ folks to him like bees to honey.
Once he rustled up himself an army, he rode on over to Moron, where the king was holed up, and captured him, makin’ true the words of the brother of Jared about bein’ taken captive.
Now Moron, where the king made his stand, was close to a place the Nephites liked to call Desolation.
And it came to pass that Kib was stuck in captivity, with Corihor, his rambunctious son, rul’n over his people till he was old as dirt; still, he managed to have one more boy named Shule while he was still trapped.
And it came to pass that Shule got riled up with his brother; he got strong as a bull, a real hard case in his own right, and mighty wise in his judgments.
So off he rode to hill Ephraim, where he started chiselin’ swords from the rock for them he’d gathered up, then armed his crew and rode back to take the fight to his brother Corihor, takin’ the crown back for his old man Kib.
Now ‘cause of what Shule had pulled, his father handed over the kingdom to him; and thus began Shule’s reign in place of his pa.
And it came to pass he ruled with fairness and stretched his areas far and wide, seein’ that folks were fillin’ the land like never before.
And it came to pass that Shule had plenty of kids too.
Corihor, though, had himself a change of heart, regrettin’ all the bad deeds he done, and Shule gave him another shot in his kingdom.
And it came to pass that Corihor brought more young’uns into the world, and one of ‘em was named Noah.
And it came to pass that Noah went against Shule, the king, and his father Corihor, rustlin’ his brother Cohor and a whole mess of folks along with him.
And he took the fight to Shule, claiming back the land where their folks first settled, and made himself the king of that patch.
Then it came to pass that he threw down against Shule again, capturin’ the king and dragging him off to Moron.
Just when Noah was fixin’ to end him, Shule's boys snuck into his hideout at night, put an end to Noah’s reign, busted down the prison door, and freed their old man, settin’ him back on his rightful throne.
So, the son of Noah set about buildin’ up his own kingdom, but they couldn’t overpower Shule any longer, and Shule's folks thrived and flourished like prairie flowers.
And the land got split right down the middle; there were two realms now—the kingdom of Shule and the kingdom of Cohor, Noah's boy.
And Cohor caused a ruckus too, gettin’ his folks to fight Shule, but Shule kicked their tails and took Cohor down.
Now Cohor had a boy named Nimrod, who threw in the towel on that kingdom and handed it over to Shule, earnin’ himself a place in the king's good graces; so Shule rewarded him handsomely and he served under Shule doin’ whatever he pleased.
And during Shule's rule, prophets came ridin’ into town, sent by the Lord, warnin’ folks that their evil ways and idol worship were bringin’ trouble down on ‘em, and if they didn’t mend their ways, doom awaited.
And it came to pass that the people started jeerin’ and laughin’ at the prophets. And it came to pass that King Shule cracked down on anyone raisin’ a ruckus against the prophets.
He set into motion a law that let the prophets roam free without fear, and that’s how the folks turned their lives around.
And because the folks got rid of their sins and false idols, the Lord showed mercy, and they started prosperin’ again. Shule had himself more sons and daughters as he got later in life.
And in Shule's days, there weren’t no more fights, and he remembered all the great things the Lord done for his kinfolk when they crossed that great ocean into the promised land; hence, he kept up with fair judgments all his days.
