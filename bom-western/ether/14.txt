The wrongdoings of the folks brought a heavy curse upon the land—Coriantumr got into a scrap with Gilead, then Lib, and then Shiz—Blood and chaos covered the ground.
Well, it started to rain down bad luck all over the land 'cause of what the folks were up to, to the point that if a fella left his tools or sword sittin' on the shelf, or wherever he kept 'em, come the next mornin', they'd be gone, so deep was the jinx layin' on the land.
So, every man clung to what was his, with his own two hands, not borrowin' nor lendin'; and every fella kept the hilt of his sword tight in his right hand, protectin' his property, his life, and his kin.
Then after two full years, and the passin' of Shared, the brother of Shared rose up and took the fight to Coriantumr, who whupped him and chased him down to the wilds of Akish.
Then the brother of Shared threw down with him in the rugged wilderness of Akish; and the battle got mighty fierce, with thousands fallin' by the pointy end of the blade.
And it happened that Coriantumr laid siege to that wilderness; and the brother of Shared rode out of the shadows at night, takin' down some of Coriantumr's tipsy soldiers.
Then he made his way to the land of Moron, and took the throne right out from under Coriantumr.
And it turned out Coriantumr hung back with his army in the wilds for two years, gainin’ considerable strength for his outfit.
Now Gilead, the brother of Shared, also gathered a good-sized army, thanks to some shady dealings among the folks.
Then, lo and behold, while sittin' on his throne, his high priest turned traitor and put him down.
Next thing you know, one of those secret conspirators cornered him in an ambush and grabbed the crown for himself; name of Lib, and he was a tall drink of water, taller than anyone else around.
In the first year of Lib’s reign, Coriantumr rolled on up to Moron and threw down with Lib.
And let me tell ya, while they fought, Lib got a lucky hit on Coriantumr's arm, wounding him; but still, Coriantumr's folks pushed ahead on Lib, who took off for the coast.
Coriantumr didn’t let up on the chase; and Lib fought back on the seashore.
But Lib smacked Coriantumr’s army hard enough that they skedaddled back into the wilds of Akish.
Then Lib took off after him till he caught up near the plains of Agosh. Coriantumr took all his folks with him as he fled from Lib in that neck of the woods.
When they hit the plains of Agosh, Coriantumr engaged Lib, and he laid a heavy hand on him till he drew his last breath; but Lib’s brother came at Coriantumr in his place, and the battle got real fierce, sendin' Coriantumr runnin' again before Lib's brother.
Now the name of Lib's brother was Shiz. And so it was Shiz hunted down Coriantumr, knockin' over towns and takin’ out women and children, burnin’ everything to the ground.
And you bet there was fear of Shiz stretchin' all over the land, and folks were shoutin’ out, "Who can stand against the mighty army of Shiz? Look out, he’s sweeping the ground clean!"
Then the people started rallyin' together in armies, spreadin' all over the landscape.
And they split up; some of 'em ran to Shiz's side, and some to Coriantumr’s.
The war had been so fierce and the blood so plentiful that there wasn't a patch of ground left free from the bodies of the fallen.
With how quick the fighting was, there weren't even enough hands left to bury the dead, marchin' from one bloodbath to another, leavin' men, women, and children sprawled out over the land, lettin' the worms feast on ‘em.
And the stench drifted across the land, spreadin' trouble day and night among the folks, all 'cause of that awful smell.
But Shiz didn’t let up on his vengeance against Coriantumr; he’d sworn to pay him back for his brother’s blood, with the Lord seein’ to it that Coriantumr wouldn't be taken down by sword.
And there you have it, the Lord visited 'em with all his wrath, and their wickedness and evil ways paved the way for their endless downfall.
So it came to pass that Shiz chased Coriantumr east toward the coastal borders, and there they fought for three straight days.
The destruction was so severe 'mongst Shiz's troops that the people started gettin' scared, runnin' away from Coriantumr’s army and headed for the land of Corihor, clearin' out anyone who wouldn’t join ‘em.
They set up their camp in the valley of Corihor; Coriantumr pitched his camp in the valley of Shurr. Now, Shurr was right near hill Comnor; so Coriantumr gathered his men on hill Comnor and blew a trumpet to call Shiz's army out for a showdown.
Well, they came out, but got sent packin' again; then they came back a second time and met the same fate. Then they came out for a third round, and the fight got real heated.
And it turned out Shiz landed a pile of deep cuts on Coriantumr, and Coriantumr lost so much blood he fainted away, lookin' as if he’d kicked the bucket.
Now, the toll of men, women, and children lost on both sides was so heavy that Shiz ordered his folks not to chase after Coriantumr’s army; so they packed it in and headed back to camp.
