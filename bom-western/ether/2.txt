Jared and his brother, along with their families and pals, saddled up and rode down into the valley that lay to the north (a place called Nimrod, named after that legendary hunter), bringin' along their critters—every kinda beast ya could think of, both male and female.
They set traps and snared themselves some birds from the sky, and rustled up a vessel to haul in some fish straight from the waters.
They also packed along some deseret, reckonin' it was a honeybee; so they brought a swarm of them pesky bees and seeds of all sorts from the land.
When they touched down in the valley of Nimrod, the Lord showed up and had a powwow with the brother of Jared, who was cloaked in a cloud, so Jared couldn’t see him.
The Lord told 'em to bust out into the wilderness, headin’ to parts unknown where no man had ever trod. And sure as shootin’, the Lord led the way, speakin' to 'em from that cloud, instructin' ‘em where to wander.
Off they went through the wilds, buildin' barges to cross many waters, with the good Lord steerin' ‘em every step of the way.
The Lord made sure they didn’t linger past the sea in the wilds, wanted ‘em to steer straight to that choice land, the best of all, preserved for folks livin' right.
He swore up and down to the brother of Jared that anyone settlin' this promised land from then on better serve Him, the one true God, or they’d be swept away when His mighty wrath came a-callin’.
Now, we can see the good Lord's words 'bout this land being a promised piece; any nation settlin’ here has to be servin' God, or they’ll get wiped out when His wrath finally boils over. And that wrath hits when folks are ripe with their sins.
Lookee here, this land is the cream of the crop, and whoever lays claim to it had better serve God or risk bein’ swept off the map, 'cause this is how the Lord set it up. It ain't till folks are just soaked in sin that they find themselves in hot water.
So, listen up, you Gentiles, ya gotta know the Lord's wishes—that ya oughta repent before it's too late, so ya don’t drag down His wrath like the folks here have done before.
This here’s a prime piece of ground, and any nation takin' it can be free from servitude if they just honor the God of this land, who’s Jesus Christ, shown through all that’s been written down.
Now I’m carryin' on with my tale; the Lord led Jared and his kin to that great sea that splits the lands. When they arrived at that sea, they set up camp and named the spot Moriancumer; they lived in tents on the shores for four long years.
At the end of them four years, the Lord returned to the brother of Jared, standing in that cloud and talking with him. For three solid hours, the Lord laid it on thick, chastisin’ him for forgettin’ to call on His name.
The brother of Jared felt mighty sorry for his wrongdoings and called to the Lord on behalf of his kin. The Lord said he’d forgive 'em, but warned him to steer clear of sin again, ‘cause His spirit ain't gonna wrestle with mankind forever. If they kept on sinning until it got too ripe, they’d be cut off from the Lord's presence. And that's the deal for the land He’s givin' them—it's gonna be one choice piece of ground.
The Lord said: Get to work and build them barges like you’ve done before. So the brother of Jared and his crew rolled up their sleeves and got to building those barges just like the Lord said—small and light, floatin’ like a bird on water.
Crafted real tight, they made sure them barges wouldn’t leak, holdin’ water like a bowl; the bottom, sides, and top were sealed up snug as a bug, and the length was like a tall tree. When the door was shut, it was as tight as a drum.
The brother of Jared hollered to the Lord, sayin': O Lord, I done what you asked, and built the barges just like you told me.
But Lord, there ain't no light inside; how’re we s’posed to steer? We’ll be a-goner if we can’t breathe in there, not unless there's air to spare, and we'll surely perish.
The Lord replied to him: Here’s the plan—make a hole in the top and bottom; when you need air, just open it up and let some in. But if water starts crashing in, cover that hole, so y'all don't drown.
So the brother of Jared went ahead and did just what the good Lord commanded.
He raised his voice to the Lord again, sayin’: O Lord, I’ve done what you asked and prepared these vessels for my people, but there’s no light in ‘em. Lord, will ya let us cross this mighty sea in dark?
And the Lord asked the brother of Jared: What is it you want me to do to give light to your vessels? ‘Cause ya can’t have windows—they’ll just shatter, and fire ain't gonna do ya no good, neither.
You see, when ya hit the waves, it'll be like a whale in the sea, and them giant swells will toss ya about. But I’ll pull you up outta the deep, 'cause I’ve sent forth the winds and the rains and the floods.
I’m fixin’ you up for all that; you can’t cross this deep ocean unless I prepare you for the waves and the winds and the floods comin’ your way. So tell me, what do ya need me to whip up for you to have light while you’re down in the depths of the sea?
