Well, partner, here’s the tale of how them Jaredite barges got blown by the winds straight to the promised land—the folks lifted up their voices in gratitude to the Good Lord for His kindness—then Orihah got himself appointed as king, and ol’ Jared along with his brother rode off into the sunset.
So here I am, Moroni, fixin’ to spin y’all the yarn about Jared and his kin.
Now it happened that after the Good Lord had set aside them stones that the brother of Jared lugged up into the hills, he come on down from the mountain, and he placed them stones into the vessels, one at each end, and lo and behold, they lit up like a campfire at night.
And just like that, the Lord made those stones shine bright in the dark, so the men, women, and little ones could make their way across them big ol’ waters without trippin’ in the dark.
So, they rustled up a heap of grub so they could keep their bellies full while floatin’ on the waters, not to mention feedin’ their critters, be they cows or chickens, and once they had everything ready, they hopped aboard their vessels or barges, givin’ their troubles over to the Lord.
Then the Lord Almighty whipped up a fierce wind blowin’ towards the promised land, tossin’ them about on the swell of the sea like leaves in a storm.
And it came to pass that they got submerged time and again in the deep blue, thanks to them mountain-sized waves crashing down, along with the wild tempests stirred up by that powerful wind.
But when they found themselves deep in the drink, no water could bother ‘em, what with their vessels sealed tight like a well-cooked stew pot, and just like Noah’s ark; so, when those waters surrounded ‘em, they cried out to the Lord, and He lifted them back up to the surface.
The wind didn’t let up blowin’ towards the promised land while they were out there on the water; so they were pushed along right by it.
They sang songs of praise to the Lord; yep, the brother of Jared sang his heart out, givin’ thanks and liftin’ his spirits to the Lord all day long; and even when the moon rose, they kept their songs goin’.
And just like that, they were pushed along, and no sea monster could lay a claw on ‘em, not even a great whale; and they had light shining on ‘em all the time, whether they were above or below the waves.
And so they floated on, round about three hundred and forty-four days over that water.
Finally, they reached the shores of the promised land. Once their boots hit solid ground, they dropped to their knees and humbled themselves in gratitude to the Lord, shedding tears of joy thanks to His many blessings.
Then they took to the land and started puttin’ their plowshares to work.
Jared had himself four sons; they went by the names of Jacom, Gilgah, Mahah, and Orihah.
The brother of Jared also had himself some sons and daughters.
And the good friends of Jared and his brother numbered round twenty-two souls, and they too had sons and daughters long before settlin’ in the promised land; so they began to multiply like rabbits.
They were shown how to walk humble-like before the Lord, and they were also taught by divine wisdom.
And then they spread out across the land, made their homes, and started workin’ the Earth; they grew stouter as the days rolled by.
As the brother of Jared started getting on in years, he knew his time on this here earth was short, so he told Jared: Let’s gather our folks and count ‘em up, find out what they be wishin’ from us before we ride off into the great beyond.
So, the folks came together. Now, the brother of Jared’s sons and daughters added up to twenty-two souls; and Jared had twelve, with his four boys.
They counted their folks, and once that was done, they asked them what they wanted before they went to rest in the grave.
The people, they figured they wanted one of their own boys to be the king over ‘em.
Now hold your horses, this didn’t sit well with ‘em. The brother of Jared said, “This ain't gonna lead nowhere good.”
But Jared replied to his brother, “Let ‘em have a king if that’s what they want.” So, he told them, “Pick one of our boys to be the king, whoever you see fit.”
The folks picked the firstborn of the brother of Jared, named Pagag. But he wouldn’t take on the role of king. They wanted his daddy to make him do it, but his daddy said no way; he told ‘em not to force any man to wear the crown.
Then they tried all of Pagag’s brothers, but none of ‘em wanted the job.
Not even the sons of Jared stepped up, all save for one; and Orihah got himself anointed king over the people.
He started his reign, and the folks hit prosperity; they struck it rich, no doubt.
Then Jared passed on, and his brother followed suit.
And Orihah kept on walkin’ humble-like before the Lord, recollectin’ all the mighty things the Lord had pulled off for his daddy, and he taught his people about the great deeds the Lord did for their fathers too.
