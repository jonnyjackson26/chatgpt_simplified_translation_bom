The Lord told the brother of Jared to hoof it down from the mount and pen down what he’d seen; and them writings weren't to be shown to folks until after he was nailed up on that cross; that’s why King Mosiah kept 'em hidden, so they wouldn't be laid bare to the world till Christ revealed himself to his tribe.
Once Christ truly showed up to his people, he gave the word that those things ought to be laid out for all to see.
Well now, it appears they’ve all wandered off into doubt; and there ain't nobody left but the Lamanites, who turned their back on the gospel of Christ; so here I am told to bury the records in the ground once more.
Look here, I’ve scratched down on these plates the very visions the brother of Jared laid eyes on; and there ain't ever been greater wonders shown than those that were revealed to him.
So, the Lord gave me the task of writing ‘em down; and I done wrote ‘em. And he told me to seal ‘em up tight; and he also instructed me to seal up the understanding of ‘em; so I went ahead and sealed up the interpreters, just like the Lord told me to.
’Cause the Lord said to me: These here shall stay quiet from the Gentiles till the day they wash away their wrongdoings and come clean before Him.
And on that day they decide to have faith in me, says the Lord, just like the brother of Jared did, so they can be made pure in me, then I’ll show 'em all the things that the brother of Jared witnessed, opening up all my revelations, says Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and the earth, and everything in 'em.
And any soul who stands against my word, let ‘em be cursed; and whoever denies these truths, let ‘em be cursed too; for I won’t show ‘em greater wonders, says Jesus Christ; for I’m the one who’s speaking.
At my beck and call, the heavens swing open and shut; and at my say-so, the earth will tremble; and at my command, folks will be wiped out, just like in a fiery inferno.
And if you don’t believe my words, then you ain’t believing my disciples; and if it turns out I’m not the one speakin’, judge for yourselves; for you’ll know it’s me by the last day.
But the ones who believe the things I’ve said, I’ll visit ‘em with my Spirit’s touch, and they’ll know and testify. For my Spirit will show ‘em these truths; it encourages folks to do good.
And everything that nudges folks toward the good comes from me; for there ain’t no good that ain’t from my hand. I’m the same one who leads men to all that’s good; if a fella won't trust my words, he won’t trust me—that’s just how it is; and he who won't trust me won’t trust the Father who sent me. Behold, I’m the Father, I’m the light, I’m the life, and I’m the truth of this world.
Come on over to me, ya Gentiles, and I’ll show y’all the bigger things, the knowledge kept under wraps 'cause of disbelief.
Gather 'round now, O house of Israel, and you’ll see just how great the treasures the Father got stored up for ya from the beginning of time; and it's not come your way ‘cause of your doubt.
Pay heed, when you tear down that veil of disbelief that keeps you stuck in your sorry state of sin and hard-heartedness, and blindness of mind, then the great and marvelous things that've been hidden from the start will be laid out for you—sure enough, when you holler out to the Father in my name, with a broken heart and a humble spirit, you’ll know that the Father hasn’t forgotten the promise He made to your ancestors, O house of Israel.
And then the revelations I had my servant John write down will be revealed to everyone. Keep in mind, when you see these things, you'll know that the time's just about here for ‘em to come to light for real.
So when you get this record, know that the Father’s work has kicked off all across the land.
Thus, y’all best repent, every last one of ya, and come to me, and put your faith in my gospel, and get baptized in my name; ‘cause whoever believes and gets baptized will be saved; but whoever doesn’t believe will find themselves in a heap of trouble; and signs will follow them that believe in my name.
And blessed is the one who remains trustworthy to my name at that final day, for he’ll be lifted up to live in the kingdom that was prepared for him since the world began. And mark my words, it’s I who’s spoken it. Amen.
