Well now, gather ‘round and let me spin ya a yarn ‘bout them Jaredites, pulled right off them twenty-four plates the Limhi folks laid eyes on back in King Mosiah’s day.
So here I am, Moroni, fixin’ to tell ya ’bout them ancient folks who kicked the bucket ‘cuz the Good Lord had His hand in it, right here in this north land.
I’m takin’ my tale from them twenty-four plates, which folks found on the run, and that’s what we call the Book of Ether.
Now, I reckon that the first part of this here record yackin’ ’bout the world’s makin’, and Adam too, all the way up to that mighty tall tower, and every little thing went down with them folks till that point, is sittin’ with the Jews—
So I ain’t gonna scribble down all that stuff from Adam’s days up to that tall tower; it’s sittin’ on them plates, and whoever lays their hands on ‘em could sure wrangle the whole tale.
But I’m just givin’ a piece of the story, from that tower down to when they met their end.
Here’s how I spin this account. The feller who wrote it was Ether, a direct descendant of old Coriantor.
Coriantor was born to a fella named Moron.
Moron had Ethem as his young’un.
And Ethem was sired by Ahah.
Ahah hailed from Seth.
Seth was the son of Shiblon.
Shiblon was brought into the world by Com.
Com came from Coriantum.
Coriantum was born to Amnigaddah.
Amnigaddah had Aaron in the family tree.
Aaron was kin to Heth, whose pop was Hearthom.
Hearthom had Lib as his youngin’.
And Lib was the son of Kish.
Kish was sired by Corom.
Corom was from Levi.
Levi’s lineage traced back to Kim.
Kim was the son of Morianton.
And Morianton was a descendant of Riplakish.
Riplakish’s father was Shez.
Shez got his roots from Heth.
And Heth’s daddy was Com.
Com was a feller from Coriantum.
Coriantum’s dad was Emer.
Emer was born to Omer.
Omer was tied to Shule.
Shule had Kib in his bloodline.
Kib brought forth Orihah, whose daddy was Jared;
Now that there Jared hit the trail with his brother and their kinfolk, along with a few others and their families, from that towering height when the Good Lord messed up the folks’ lingo, swearing in His rage that they'd be scattered all over this here earth; and, lo and behold, just as the Lord saith, the people were scattered.
Now, Jared's brother was a big ol’ strong feller, mighty favored by the Lord, and Jared spoke to him: Yell out to the Lord, so He don’t mix up our words and leave us scratchin’ our heads.
Well sir, the brother of Jared called out to the Lord, and the Lord had a soft spot for Jared; so He didn’t mix up Jared’s words, and both brothers were left standin’ tall.
Then Jared says to his brother: Give it another shot with the Lord, ‘cause maybe He’ll ease up on His anger towards our pals, so they don’t get their tongues tangled up.
So, it happened, the brother of Jared called out to the Lord again, and the Lord had mercy on their pals and their families, so none of ‘em got all mixed up.
Then Jared spoke again to his brother, sayin’: Go ask the Lord if He’ll kick us outta this land, and if He’s gonna, see where we should head. Who knows, maybe the Lord will lead us to a land that’s the cream of the crop? If that’s the case, let’s stay faithful so we can claim it as our own.
So the brother of Jared called out to the Lord, just like Jared told him to do.
And sure enough, the Lord heard that brother of Jared, showed him some compassion, and said:
Gather up your herds, all your critters, male and female of every kind; along with all the seeds of the earth, and your families; plus Jared your brother and his kin; and also your friends and their families, and Jared’s pals and their families too.
When you’ve done all that, you’ll lead ‘em down to the north valley. I’ll meet ya there, and I’ll go ahead of ya to a prime piece of land, better than any in all the earth.
There, I’ll bless you and your offspring, and raise up a great nation from your bloodline and your brother’s, and all who follow ya. There won’t be no nation greater than what I’ll raise up from your line, across this whole wide world. That’s what I’ll do for you ‘cause all this time you’ve been callin’ out to me.
