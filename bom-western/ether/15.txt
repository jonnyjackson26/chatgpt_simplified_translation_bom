Well now, it happened that once Coriantumr had a chance to mend his wounds, he started recalling the wise words that ol’ Ether had laid upon him.
He noticed that near two million of his folks had already bit the dust from sword fights, and his heart got heavy with sorrow; yes sir, two million strong men laid low, along with their wives and little ones.
He began to feel real remorse for the wrongs he’d done; them prophetic words started ringing in his ears, and he could see how they’d all come true, just like they said; it sure weighed down his soul, and he just couldn’t find any comfort.
So he picked up his pen and sent a letter to Shiz, askin' him to go easy on the folks, promising to hand over the crown just to save their lives.
Well, Shiz got that letter and fired back with one of his own; he said if Coriantumr would lay down his arms, he might just let his folks live and take him down with his own blade.
Yet, the folks just wouldn’t repent for the bad they’d done; Coriantumr’s crowd was riled up against Shiz’s lot, and the Shiz folks felt the same about Coriantumr; so they clashed like bulls in a china shop.
When Coriantumr sensed the tide turning against him, he skedaddled before Shiz and his crew.
It so happened that he made it to them waters called Ripliancum, which means the big ol’ waters; so when they got there, they set up camp, and Shiz did the same nearby, and come mornin’, they squared off for another round.
They got into a fierce tussle that day, and Coriantumr took a hit again, fainting ‘cause of the blood loss.
But Coriantumr’s army pushed hard against Shiz's forces and sent 'em running southward, setting up camp in a place called Ogath.
Then Coriantumr’s army made camp by the hill called Ramah; the very hill where my daddy Mormon stashed away those sacred records for the Big Guy above.
And it came to pass that they gathered every last soul left on the land who hadn’t met their end, except for Ether.
Ether watched closely all the happenings; he saw those who stood with Coriantumr rallying to his side, and likewise, the Shiz supporters flockin' to Shiz’s camp.
So they spent four long years collectin' folks, trying to muster every last man available to bolster their strength.
When they finally had everyone gathered, each to their own side with their families—men, women, and children all armed to the teeth with weapons, shields, chest plates, and headgear meant for war—they marched against each other ready for a scrap; they fought all day but didn’t gain an inch.
When night rolled around, they were mighty tired and pulled back to their camps; once there, they let out howls and laments for all the lives lost, and their cries filled the air like a restless wind.
But come the next dawn, they jumped back into the fray again, and oh what a dreadful day it was; yet again, not a single side was victorious, and when night returned, their wails and laments echoed in the air for their fallen kin.
So Coriantumr sent another letter to Shiz, askin’ him to just hold off on the fights, take the crown instead, and spare their people’s lives.
But lo and behold, the Spirit of the Lord had hung up its spurs with them, and the devil had taken the reins of the folks’ hearts; they were all stiff-necked and blind as bats, headin' to their doom, so they charged back into battle again.
So they fought all day long, and when darkness fell, they laid their heads upon their swords to catch some shut-eye.
And come the mornin’, they went at it again right up ‘til nightfall.
When night hit again, they were as drunk on fury as a cowboy on whiskey, and they laid their heads once more on their swords.
Next day rolled around, and they were back at it; by nightfall, all but fifty-two of Coriantumr’s crew and sixty-nine of Shiz’s men had fallen by the sword.
Now it was nighttime again, and they laid their swords down, and the next day they clashed once more, fighting fiercely all day with sword and shield in hand.
When night fell, there were thirty-two left from Shiz’s camp, and twenty-seven from Coriantumr’s.
Then they had a meal and got some rest, gearing up for death’s call next day; they were hefty and strong, just like real frontier folk.
They hashed it out for a solid three hours, but in the end, they were just about done in from the blood loss.
When Coriantumr’s boys finally gathered their strength to walk, they thought about hittin’ the trail to save their skins; but quick as a flash, Shiz and his men rose up, vowing that he’d take down Coriantumr or fall trying.
So he chased ‘em down, and the next day they clashed with swords once more; and when the dust settled, all had fallen except for Coriantumr and Shiz, but Shiz had also collapsed from blood loss.
And it happened that Coriantumr leaned on his sword for a spell, took a moment to catch his breath, then he swung and took off Shiz's head.
After he did that, Shiz raised himself up on his hands for one last struggle before he finally breathed his last.
Then Coriantumr crumpled to the ground like a sack of potatoes, seeming lifeless.
The Lord spoke to Ether, telling him to rise up; and he did, seeing all the Lord’s words had come to pass; he finished up his record (though he hadn’t written about a hundred parts) and tucked it away where the folks of Limhi later stumbled upon it.
Now the last thing that Ether wrote was this: Whether the Lord decides to whisk me away or if I bear my trials in this body, it don’t matter none, as long as I’m saved in the good Lord's kingdom. Amen.
