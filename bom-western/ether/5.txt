Well now, partner, three folks who bear witness and the good ol' work itself will stand tall as proof of the truth of the Book of Mormon.
Now listen up, I’m Moroni, and I’ve jotted down the words I was told to write, using what I recollect; I’ve laid out the stuff I sealed up, so don’t go pokin' around in 'em to translate, ‘cause that’s off-limits to ya unless the Big Guy upstairs gives the nod.
Y’all might just find yourselves lucky enough to show those plates to some good souls helpin’ to rustle up this here venture;
And it’ll be three folks that’ll lay eyes on ‘em by the hand of God; that’s how they’ll know for certain these things are true.
And with the testimony of these three witnesses, the truth will be established; the word and the power of God will shine forth, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear witness—and all this will stand tall as a testament against the whole wide world come Judgment Day.
And if they decide to turn their ways and head back to the Father in the name of Jesus, they’ll be taken into the kingdom of God.
Now, if I ain’t got the authority to say this, you reckon for yourselves; you'll know I've got the goods when you see me, and we’ll stand together before the Almighty at the end of days. Amen.
