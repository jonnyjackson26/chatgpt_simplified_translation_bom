Well now, there sure was a heap of trouble brewin' over the throne—Akish got together a secret gang, swore himself in, and plotted to take out the king—Them secret groups be devilish and lead to a whole mess of ruin for nations—Folks nowadays best keep their eyes peeled for such sneaky crews that aim to rob the liberty from all lands and folks everywhere.
And it came to be that he fathered Omer, who took the reins in his place. Omer then fathered Jared; and Jared went on to have himself a whole gaggle of sons and daughters.
But Jared, that rascal, turned his back on his old man and set up shop in the land of Heth. He had a way with words, smooth as a snake’s belly, and before long he’d persuaded a good chunk of the kingdom to follow him.
Once he had folks on his side, he threw down with his dad, overpowered him, and took him captive, making him serve his time in chains.
Now as it stands, while Omer was reignin’, he spent half of his days in the clink. But he still managed to father sons and daughters, two of whom were Esrom and Coriantumr.
Well, they were mighty enraged at their brother Jared for all the mischief he’d stirred up, so they rallied a posse and challenged Jared to a showdown. And they caught him off guard one night.
When they had wiped out Jared’s bunch, they were fixin’ to finish him off too; but he begged ‘em not to take his life, promising he’d hand the kingdom back to his dad. So, they let him live, out of mercy.
But Jared was down in the dumps ‘cause he lost the kingdom, for he'd set his sights mighty high on that throne and on worldly glory.
Now, Jared’s daughter, sharp as a tack and seein' her father’s heartache, cooked up a scheme to fetch back the throne for him.
She was a sight to behold, that daughter of Jared. She sat down with her old man and asked, "Why’s my father so restless? Ain't he heard the tales of our ancestors who crossed the big water? Isn’t there a yarn about ‘em that shows how they got kingdoms and glory with their sly plans?"
“Now, let’s get me in touch with Akish, son of Kimnor; I’ll put on a show, wiggle my way into his heart, and make him want me as his bride. So if he asks you to give me to him, you tell him this: I’ll hand her over if he brings me my dad's head on a platter.”
Omer was tight with Akish; so when Jared sent word, his daughter charmed him with her dance and he was smitten enough to ask Jared, “You give her to me.”
And Jared shot back, “Sure thing, if you bring me my father’s head.”
So, Akish gathered his whole clan under his roof and asked ‘em, “Will y’all swear to stand by me for what I want?”
And lo and behold, they all swore on God above and below, and on their own noggins too, that if any of ‘em went back on what Akish wanted, they'd lose their heads; and if anyone spilled the beans on what Akish told ‘em, they’d be a goner too.
So they all made a pact with Akish. He laid down the old oaths that those who craved power had passed down through the ages, tracing back to Cain, that scoundrel who started the bloody business.
These oaths were kept alive by the devil’s might to pull folks into the shadows, helping those after power to get power, to kill, to loot, to lie, and commit all sorts of foul deeds and shenanigans.
It was Jared’s daughter who stirred up old thoughts in his mind; and Jared whispered those thoughts into Akish’s ear; so Akish spread it to his kin and pals, leading ‘em on with smooth talk to do his bidding.
Soon enough, they formed a secret gang just like the old days; and this here gang was the most detestable and wicked in God’s sight.
The Lord don’t mess with secret groups, nor does He want man spillin’ blood, having forbidden such wickedness since day one.
Now, I, Moroni, won’t be penning down the details of how their oaths and shenanigans worked, ‘cause it’s been made clear to me that folks everywhere are in on it, including the Lamanites.
These schemes are what brought the downfall of the folks I'm yappin’ ‘bout, and the ruin of the Nephites too.
And any nation that backs these secret gangsters, schemin’ for power and profit, will end up takin’ the fall; for the Lord won’t stand by while His saints’ blood cries out for justice from the ground, and He don’t avenge ‘em.
So, listen up, oh ye Gentiles, it’s wise in God’s eyes to open yours to this truth, so you can turn from your wicked ways and keep from lettin’ these murderous groups take over, which are on the hunt for power and riches—and so the tide of destruction doesn’t wash over you, for the very sword of God’s justice will strike you down if you let it happen.
Thus, the Lord commands y’all when you see these dark clouds gatherin’, to wake up to the dangers lurkin’ ‘round with these secret combinations among ya; else woe be it, ‘cause the blood of the slain cries out from the ground for vengeance against it, and against those who built it up.
For whosoever erects this wicked structure aims to bring down the freedom of every land, nation, and territory; and it spells disaster for all folks, built up by that no-good devil, who’s the father of all lies; the same deceiver who led our first folks astray, and who’s kept mankind from gettin' blood on their hands since the start; he’s the one who’s hardened men’s hearts so they'd stoned the prophets and cast 'em away from the get-go.
So I, Moroni, am under orders to write these truths so that evil may be put to rest, and that someday Satan won’t have a grip on the hearts of men, but that they might be coaxed into doin’ good time and again, findin’ their way to the source of all righteousness and be saved.
