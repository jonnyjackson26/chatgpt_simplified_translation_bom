Well now, listen up, partner. Here’s the scoop from that there Book of Mormon, translated into some good ol' western talk.
So, reckon it happened that the thirty-fourth year moseyed on by, and then the thirty-fifth too. And wouldn’t ya know it, the folks followin’ Jesus formed themselves a church of Christ all over the territories. Any folks who made their way to 'em, truly repentin’ from their misdeeds, got dunked in Jesus's name, and also laid claim to the Holy Ghost.
Then came the thirty-sixth year, and wouldn’t ya see, everybody around—Nephites and Lamanites alike—turned their hearts to the Lord. Not a scrap of bickering or fussin’ among ‘em, and everyone dealt fair as a good cowboy oughta.
They all shared what they had amongst themselves, so there weren’t no rich or poor, no bondsmen or free men—just folks livin’ free and takin’ part in heavenly blessings.
The thirty-seventh year ambled on by, and still, peace reigned in the land.
The disciples of Jesus worked up some real marvels; they healed the sick, brought the dead back to life, helped the lame get back on their feet, opened blind eyes, and made deaf ears hear. Had themselves a whole mess of miracles happenin’, all done in Jesus’s name.
Just like that, the thirty-eighth year rolled on, followed by the thirty-ninth, forty-first, and forty-second, till the forty-ninth year came round, and then even the fifty-first and fifty-second flew by.
The Lord sure did bless ‘em plentiful like, to the point they rebuilt towns that had previously been reduced to ashes.
Yup, that grand ol’ city of Zarahemla got rebuilt too.
But there were plenty of towns that got swallowed up by the waters, and those couldn’t be brought back to life.
Now here’s the thing: the people of Nephi grew strong, multiplied real fast, and became a mighty fine-lookin’ bunch.
They got themselves hitched and started families, blessed according to all the promises the Lord made to ‘em.
They quit followin’ the old laws of Moses and started walkin’ in the commandments they got from their Lord, keepin' up with fastin’, prayin’, and meetin’ regularly to chat about the word of the Lord.
Not a quibble to be found among the folks; mighty miracles were rollin’ in thanks to the disciples of Jesus.
Then the seventy-first year slid by, followed by the seventy-second, hittin' their stride until the seventy-ninth rolled on, and soon enough, a whole hundred years had gone by, and all the disciples Jesus had chosen had moved on to paradise, ‘cept for three who stuck around—while others got set apart in their place. Meanwhile, a good many folks from that time had passed on.
There still wasn’t any bickering, on account of the Lord's love sittin' heavy in the folks' hearts.
No envy, no fights, no ruckus, no promiscuity, no lyin’, no killin’, or any kind of hanky-panky; no doubt about it, they were a happier bunch than any folk created by the Good Lord.
No robbers, no murderers, no Lamanites nor any other kinds of -ites; they were just the children of Christ, heirs of the good ol' kingdom.
Man, they were truly blessed! The Lord showered ‘em with fortune in all they did; they thrived and prospered right up to a hundred and ten years, with the first generation from Christ moving on, and no squabblin' around in all the land.
Then came Nephi, that feller who kept this record safe, and he laid it down on them plates of Nephi. When he kicked the bucket, his boy Amos took over the record, keeping it on them plates too.
And he held onto it for eighty-four years, with peace still lingerin’ in the land, ‘cept for a few who turned their backs on the church and called themselves Lamanites; thus, the Lamanites came back around.
Eventually, Amos met his maker too, which was one hundred ninety-four years since Christ showed up, and his boy Amos picked up the reins of the record, writing it down on the plates of Nephi again, also scribbling it in the book of Nephi itself.
Well, two hundred years passed like a tumbleweed in the wind, and the second generation was all but a handful in number.
Now, I’m Mormon, and let me tell ya, the folks had multiplied, spreadin’ wide across the land, and they got downright rich, thanks to all that prosperity bein’ found in Christ.
Come the year 201, and folks started actin’ haughty, wearin’ fancy duds, pearls, and all sorts of worldly riches.
Once that started, they began to share less and less of their goods.
Divisions cropped up, and they started buildin’ churches for their own gain, turning their backs on the true church of Christ.
Come the two hundred and tenth year, plenty of churches sprang up—many claimin’ to know Christ but outright denyin’ large parts of His gospel, lettin’ all sorts of wickedness come right through and treatin’ sacred things like they were no better than dirt.
That church began to grow fast like a prairie fire, driven by iniquity and that sneaky power of Satan, who got a grip on their hearts.
Another church popped up that denied Christ, givin’ the true church a hard time ‘cause of their humble hearts and steadfast belief in Him; they looked down at ‘em because of all the miracles rockin’ ‘round.
So, they flexed their muscles and tried to impose their will on the disciples of Jesus still hangin’ around, throwin’ ‘em in the slammer. But by the power of God’s word within ‘em, the cells split right open, and they were out there doin’ mighty miracles again.
Still, despite all them miracles, folks hardened their hearts, lookin’ to take ‘em down just like the Jews tried with Jesus in Jerusalem.
They tossed ‘em into fiery furnaces, but they strutted right out unscathed.
They even shoved ‘em into dens full of feral beasts, and those disciples played with ‘em like a kid would with a lamb, comin’ out of there without a scratch.
Yet the hearts of the people remained hard, led by a bunch of priests and false prophets who built up all sorts of churches, indulgin’ in all manner of evil. They took swings at Jesus's folks, but those folks didn’t fight back. That’s how they faded away into disbelief and sin year after year, till two hundred thirty years rolled on.
Then, in the year two hundred thirty-one, a big split hit the people.
A group emerged called the Nephites, true believers in Christ, but also got them Lamanites named Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites among ‘em.
Thus, the real believers in Christ and the true worshippers (including those three disciples who waited around) were known as Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites.
It turned out those who turned their backs on the gospel were now known as Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; they didn’t fade away in disbelief but actively rebelled against the gospel of Christ, teachin’ their young’uns the same ol’ tale of doubt their fathers had spun from the start.
All of this wickedness and abomination stemmed from their fathers’ misdeeds, just like in the beginning. They were raised to despise the children of God, just like the Lamanites were taught to loathe the children of Nephi right from the get-go.
Now, two hundred forty-four years passed, and that’s the way the town was runnin’. The wicked part of the folks gained strength, growin' more numerous by the day compared to God’s peeps.
They kept on building churches for themselves, trimmin’ ‘em with all sorts of treasures. Another two hundred fifty years ticked by, followed by two hundred sixty.
Then those no-good folks of Gadianton started to rise up again, sneakin’ around and schemin’.
Meanwhile, the Nephite folks grew proud in their hearts due to all their riches, struttin’ around like their Lamanite brethren.
That’s when the disciples began to feel sorrowful for the world’s wrongs.
After three hundred years had slipped away, Nephites and Lamanites turned out pretty durn wicked, just about alike.
Gadianton robbers roamed the lands, with hardly a righteous soul left—only the disciples of Jesus in all this mess. They hoarded gold and silver, tradin’ in all sorts of goods.
Then came three hundred and five years down the line; the people stayed mired in wickedness and Amos passed away. His brother Ammaron took up the record in his place.
And when three hundred and twenty years rolled on, Ammaron, pushed by the Holy Ghost, hid away them sacred records—every single one passed down from folk to folk—for all those three hundred twenty years since Christ showed up.
He stashed 'em away to the Lord so they'd come back to the remnants of Jacob’s house, just like the prophecies and promises of the Lord foretold. And that's how Ammaron’s record came to an end.
