Hear ye, hear ye, all folks, clans, tongues, and kin, who lay eyes on this here work: Us four, with the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, have laid eyes on them plates holdin’ this here record, a tale of the Nephi folks and their kin, the Lamanites, and also the descendants of Jared, who rode in from that tower folks been yappin’ about. We reckon they’ve been translated by the good Lord’s hand, seein’ as how His voice has hollered it out to us; so we know for certain that this is the real deal. And we bear witness that we’ve beheld the carvings on them plates; they was shown to us by God’s might, not by mere human strength. Straight up, we say, an angel of God rode down from above and laid them before our peepers, and we gazed upon the plates and their etchings thereon; and we’re sure it’s only by the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ that we saw and testify these things are true. It’s a sight to behold, I tell ya. But the Lord’s voice bid us to share our witness; so, bein’ faithful to God's commands, we testify about these happenings. And we’re certain that if we stick to Christ, we’ll wash our garments clean of the blood of all men, showin’ up spotless before Christ’s judgment seat, ready to dwell with Him in the heavens forever. And glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are one God. Amen.
