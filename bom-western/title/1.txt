The Book of Mormon
An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi
So, this here is a condensed version of the tales of the Nephites and the Lamanites—It’s penned for the Lamanites, who are leftover kin of Israel; and it’s also meant for Jews and folks from other backgrounds—Written by order of the Almighty, and stirred up by the spirit of prophecy and revelations—Scrawled and sealed tight, stashed away for the Lord’s eyes only, so they wouldn't go to waste—It’s gonna come out through the good graces and power of God for folks to make sense of it—Locked up by Moroni’s own hand, kept for the Lord's timing to show up via the Gentiles—The understanding of it is by God’s gift.
Now, there’s a shortening taken from the Book of Ether too, which tells of Jared's folks who got scattered when the Lord mixed up their words making ‘em build a tower trying to reach the sky—This here’s meant to show the remaining kin of Israel just what mighty deeds the Lord has pulled off for their ancestors; and so they can grasp the Lord’s promises, knowing they aren’t cast away for good—And it’s also to convince Jews and Gentiles alike that Jesus is the Christ, the Everlasting God, showin’ Himself to all nations—Now, if there’s any slip-ups, they’re due to human error; so don’t be quick to blame the things of God, so you won’t be found dirty when you stand before Christ’s judgment chair.
Translated by Joseph Smith, Jun.
