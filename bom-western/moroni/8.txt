Baptizin’ little ones is a downright wicked business—Them young’uns are right with the Good Lord ‘cause of the Atonement—Faith, repentance, bein’ humble and lowly of heart, acceptin’ the Holy Ghost, and stickin’ it out till the end is what brings salvation. 'Bout A.D. 401–21.
This here is a letter from my father Mormon, penned to me, Moroni; and it was wrote right after I got myself into the ministry. And here's what he had to say:
My dear son, Moroni, I’m mighty happy that your Lord Jesus Christ’s been keepin’ an eye on ya, and has called you into his ministry and his holy work.
I reckon on you always in my prayers, keepin’ at it with God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, hopin’ that through his endless goodness and grace, He’ll keep you strong in faith right up until the end.
Now, my son, I gotta talk to ya about somethin’ that’s weighin’ heavy on my heart; it troubles me that there’s been fussin’ amongst ya.
‘Cause, if I’ve learned anythin’ true, there’s been a mighty ruckus about baptizin’ your little ones.
Now, my son, I’m hopin’ ya’ll work real hard to fix this big mistake, ‘cause that’s why I’m penning this here letter.
For as soon as I caught wind of this, I asked the Lord about it. And the Lord’s word came to me through the power of the Holy Ghost, sayin’:
Hearken to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Look here, I came into this world not to call the good folks but sinners to mend their ways; the whole don’t need a doc, but only those who are ailing; hence, little children are whole, ‘cause they ain't capable of doin’ wrong; therefore, the curse of Adam don’t touch them through me; and the law of circumcision is wiped away in me.
And just like that, the Holy Ghost revealed God’s word to me; so, my dear son, I reckon it’s a grievous joke before God that y’all should be baptizin’ little ones.
Now listen close, for I’m tellin’ you to teach—repentin’ and baptizin’ only those who’re accountable and able to do wrong; indeed, tell the folks that they gotta repent and get baptized, and humble themselves like the little ones, and they’ll all be saved along with their young’uns.
And them little ones don’t need no repentin’, nor baptism. Hear this, baptism is for repentin’, fulfillin’ the commandments for the forgivin’ of sins.
But them young’uns are alive in Christ right from the very start; if not, God’s a favoritist, and also fickle, and picks and chooses; for how many little ones have passed on without bein’ baptized!
Wherefore, if them little ones couldn’t be saved without baptism, then they must be headin’ for a never-endin’ hell.
Now I’m tellin’ you, anyone who thinks little children need baptism is licked by bitterness and wrapped up in sin; ‘cause they got neither faith, hope, nor love; so, if they get cut off while thinkin’ this, they’re bound to find hell.
For it’s downright a wicked way to reckon that God saves one young’un ‘cause of baptism, while another suffers ‘cause they ain’t got it.
Woe to them that twist the paths of the Lord like this, for they’re bound to perish unless they repent. I speak boldly, with authority from God; and I ain’t scared of what men can do; ‘cause perfect love drives out all fear.
And I’m filled with love that lasts forever; so all children are just the same to me; I love them little ones with a love that’s perfect; and they’re all equal and partakers of salvation.
‘Cause I know God ain’t a favoritist, nor a fickle spirit; but He’s the same from way back when to the end of time.
Little children can’t repent; thus, it’s a wicked thing to deny the pure mercies of God to them, for they’re all alive in Him because of His grace.
And anyone who says that little ones need baptism is denyin’ Christ’s mercies, and takin’ lightly his atonement and the power of his redemption.
Woe to such folks, for they’re teeterin’ on the edge of death, hell, and never-endin’ torment. I’m speakin’ it clear as day; God’s told me to. Pay heed and listen, or they’ll stand against you at Christ’s judgment seat.
For look here, all little ones are alive in Christ, and all who are without the law. The power of redemption comes to all who are without law; so, if a body ain’t condemned, or under no condemnation, they can’t repent; and baptism don’t mean a lick to such folks—
But it’s just a mockery before God, denyin’ Christ’s mercies, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and puttin’ faith in dead works.
Now listen here, my son, this here’s just not right; ‘cause repentin’ is for those under condemnation and the curse of the broken law.
And the first step of repentin’ is baptism; and baptism comes from faith fulfillin’ the commandments; and fulfillin’ them commandments brings forgiveness of sins;
And the forgivin’ of sins brings meekness and a lowly heart; and because of meekness and lowliness comes the visit of the Holy Ghost, that Comforter that fills ya with hope and perfect love, which love holds on through prayin’ till the end comes, when all the saints will be with God.
Now look sharp, my son, I’ll write to ya again if I don’t head out soon against the Lamanites. See, the pride of this here nation, or the people of the Nephites, has been their downfall unless they get their act together.
Pray for ‘em, my son, that they find some room for repentance. But I worry that the Spirit’s stopped tryin’ with ‘em; and here in this part of the country, they’re also tryin’ to stamp out all authority that comes from God; and they’re rejectin’ the Holy Ghost.
After turnin’ away from such great knowledge, my son, they’re bound to perish soon, bringin’ to pass the prophecies said by the prophets and our Savior’s own words.
So long for now, my son, until I can write to ya again, or see ya face to face. Amen.
