Well now, let me spin this yarn for ya:
Folks who’ve turned over a new leaf get dipped and welcomed into the fold—Them church folks who fess up are pardoned—Gatherings are run by the Holy Ghost’s power. 'Bout A.D. 401–21.
Now I’m a-gonna jaw about baptism. Looky here, them elders, priests, and teachers got themselves baptized; and they didn’t get dipped unless they had shown they were worthy, bringin’ forth good fruit.
They didn’t take in nobody for baptism unless they strolled forward with a shattered heart and a humble spirit, swearin’ to the congregation that they truly regretted all their wrongdoings.
And nobody was taken in for baptism unless they donned the name of Christ and was set on servin’ Him 'til they hit the dirt.
Once they were dunked, and purified by the Holy Ghost’s power, they got counted among the good folks of Christ’s church; their names got noted down, so they wouldn’t be forgotten and could grow strong from the good word of God, stayin’ on the straight and narrow, always on the lookout for prayer, leanin’ on the merits of Christ, who was the start and finish of their faith.
And the congregation would gather together plentifully, to fast and to pray, havin' conversations about the well-bein’ of their souls.
They’d meet up often to share bread and wine, rememberin’ the good Lord Jesus.
And they stayed sharp about no wrongdoing among ‘em; if anyone was caught in the act, and three witnesses came forward from the church to call ‘em out, and if that scoundrel didn’t turn back or confess, their name got scratched off the list, and they weren’t part of Christ’s folks no more.
But whenever they genuinely repented and sought out forgiveness, they were pardoned, sure as shootin’.
And their gatherin’s were run by the church, just like how the Spirit works, led by the Holy Ghost; for wherever the Holy Ghost nudged ‘em—be it preachin’, exhortin’, prayin’, plead’n, or singin’—that’s how it was done.
