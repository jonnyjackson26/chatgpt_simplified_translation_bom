The way them elders and priests serve up the bread and wine of the Good Lord to the folks in the congregation is laid out right here.
The elders and priests handed out the body and blood of Christ to the congregation, followin' the good instructions laid down by Christ, and we reckon this way is the right way; and that elder or priest took care of it—
Then they all hit the ground on their knees with the church folks, prayin' up to the Big Guy in the name of the Savior, sayin':
Oh Lord, the Everlastin’ Father, we’re askin’ ya in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and set apart this bread for the souls of everyone who digs into it; that they may partake in rememberin' the body of your Son, and testifyin’ to you, Oh Lord, the Everlastin' Father, that they’re willin’ to take on the name of your Son, and always keep Him in their hearts, and stick to His commandments that He’s laid out for 'em, so they can always have His Spirit hangin’ around with 'em. Amen.
