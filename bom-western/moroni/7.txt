Well now, folks, gather ‘round and let me spin you a tale about restin’ in the Lord’s embrace—callin’ on y’all to pray with a real heart—it's the Spirit of Christ that lets us tell right from wrong—beware, for there's a sneaky varmint named Satan tryin’ to lead folks astray from Christ and into mischief—the prophets sure did have the scoop on Christ’s arrival—through faith, miracles happen, and angels come to lend a hand—people oughta cling to eternal life and hold on tight to charity. This here’s about A.D. 401 to 21.
So here I am, Moroni, penning down some wise words from my old pops, Mormon, who had plenty to say about faith, hope, and charity; he sure did know how to chat with his folks when he spoke in that fancy synagogue they put together for worship.
Now listen up, my dear brethren; by the good graces of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, I got the chance to speak these words to ya, all thanks to His holy will and the calling He’s graced upon me this very moment.
Now, I’m here to holler at y’all who are part of the church, the good-natured followers of Christ, who’ve found a solid hope that lets ya kick back and rest in the Lord from here on out till ya find your rest with Him up yonder in heaven.
And I reckon I can judge you folks by your peaceful stride alongside your fellow man.
I remember the good book says, you’ll know folks by the fruits they bear; if them fruits are good, then you know they’re good folks, too.
See here, God’s made it clear, an evil man can’t rustle up any good; if he’s handin’ out gifts or prayin’ to God, but ain't got a real heart in it, it don’t profit him a lick.
Yep, it don’t count towards him bein' a good fella.
If a man’s wicked and gives a gift, he’s doin' it grumpily; so it’s just like he never even gave it, which puts him on the naughty list in God’s eyes.
And it’s the same story if a man prays but ain't got a true heart behind it; it don’t benefit him at all 'cause God ain’t takin' no part in that.
So yeah, a man who’s up to no good can’t do any good either; and he ain't likely to give a proper gift.
You can’t draw fresh water from a bitter spring; and a good spring ain't gonna flow with bitter water; so too, a servant of the devil can’t be followin' Christ, and if he’s chasin' after Christ, he ain't servin' the devil.
So hear this—everything good comes from God; all them evils come from the devil, who’s always throwin’ punches at God and tryin’ to lure folks into sin and wrongdoing.
But pay attention—what’s of God always invites folks to do good; so anything that nudges ya to love God and serve Him is backed by Him.
So be careful, dear brethren, don’t go and call what's wicked as good or twist what’s good from God to say it’s from the devil.
For let me tell ya, brethren, you’re given the eye to know right from wrong; judging’s as clear as day and night.
For the Spirit of Christ is granted to every single soul, helpin’ ya know good from evil; hence, I’m showin’ ya how to judge—anything that calls ya to do good and believe in Christ comes from Him; thus you can recognize without a doubt it’s pure.
But if something’s coaxing folks into doing wicked deeds, disbelieving in Christ, and denying Him, you can know for sure it’s from the devil; that’s how he operates—never leadin’ nobody to good, no sir; not him or his minions or anyone who falls under his sway.
Now, brethren, since you know the light that helps you judge, which is the light of Christ, don’t be goin' and makin’ wrong judgments; 'cause however ya judge will be how you get judged in return.
So I’m urg'in ya, brothers, dig deep in the light of Christ so ya can discern good from evil; if you grab hold of every good thing and don’t shun it, you’ll surely be a child of Christ.
And now, brethren, how in tarnation can ya grab hold of every good thing?
I’m fixin’ to talk about that faith I mentioned earlier; lemme share how you can latch on to every good thing.
For God, who knows all from start to finish, sent angels to help the folks here and show ‘em the way to Christ; and in Christ, every good thing is on its way.
God also declared to the prophets, straight from His mouth, that Christ was gonna come.
And behold, He showed the folks many ways of revealing good things; every good thing comes from Christ; otherwise, folks would've been lost, without a chance for any good.
So through them angels ministering and every word that came from God’s mouth, men started to place their faith in Christ; thus, by faith, they held on to every good thing, right up till Christ made His entry.
And after He came, those folks were saved by faith in His name; and through faith, they became the sons of God. As sure as the sun rises, Christ told our ancestors: Whatever you ask the Father in my name, in the spirit of belief, will surely come true for you.
So, my dear brethren, have the miracles dried up now that Christ has ascended to heaven and taken His rightful place next to God, claiming the mercy rights for the folks down here?
He’s fulfilled the law’s demands and claims all who trust in Him; those who have faith will cling to all things good; He’s right there advocating for us folks, livin' eternally in the heavens.
Now, since He’s done all that, I ask ya, have miracles really come to a halt? I tell ya, no way; the angels haven’t stopped ministering to the folks either.
For they serve Him, obeying His word, showing up for those with faith that’s strong and a heart full of godliness.
Their job is to call folks to repentance and get the Father’s covenant work done for all people, paving the way by preachin’ the word of Christ to His chosen ones so they can testify about Him.
And while doin’ all this, the Lord’s makin’ sure that all the rest of mankind can believe in Christ, so the Holy Ghost can settle into their hearts and bring forth the Father’s promises to the people.
And Christ has said: If you put your faith in me, you’ll have the power to do whatever is right by me.
And He’s also said: Everyone on this earth, come to me, repent, be baptized in my name, and believe in me so you can be saved.
Now, my dear brethren, if what I’ve been sayin’ is true, God’s gonna show ya with a powerful and glorious display on the final day that it's all the real deal, so tell me, has the day of miracles come to an end?
Or have angels stopped showin’ up for the people? Or has He pulled the power of the Holy Ghost from ‘em? Or will He continue on until time, or the earth, or a single soul left standin’ gives their heart to be saved?
I tell ya, no; ‘cause it’s by faith that miracles are made real, and it’s by faith that angels show up to help folks; so if that’s all stopped, then woe be to the lot of humanity, 'cause it’s a sign of unbelief, and everything’s in vain.
For no man can find salvation, by the words of Christ, ‘less they have faith in His name; so if these things have stopped, then faith has taken a tumble too; and it’s mighty bleak for folks, like there’s never been a way out.
But I tell ya, my beloved brethren, I see better things in you, for I reckon you’ve got faith in Christ ‘cause of your humble hearts; if you ain’t got faith in Him, then you surely don’t fit within His flock.
And once more, my dear brethren, I’m back to talkin’ ‘bout hope. How could ya ever get to real faith if ya don’t have hope?
And what’s it that you’re hopin’ for? I tell ya, it’s through the atonement of Christ and the power of His resurrection, givin’ ya life eternal, all ‘cause of your faith in Him, just like the promise says.
So if a fella has faith, he’s gotta have hope; ‘cause without faith, there can be none of that hope.
And again, I say that a man can’t hold faith and hope unless he’s got a meek and humble heart.
If not, his hope and faith are all for nothin’, ‘cause only the meek and humble count with God; and if a man is humble and low down in heart, confessin’ through the Spirit that Jesus is the Christ, he’s gotta have charity; ‘cause without charity, he’s just nothin’; so he’s gotta hold on to charity.
Charity’s patient, it’s kind, it don’t envy, it ain’t all puffed up, don’t seek its own gain, easy to get along with, and don’t think bad things; it don’t rejoice in wrongness but finds joy in truth, bears all trials, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.
So my dear brethren, if you don’t have charity, you’re nothin’; charity never runs dry. So hold tight to charity, the greatest treasure of all, ‘cause all else will fade—
But charity is that pure love from Christ, and it lasts forever; and anyone who’s lucky enough to have it when the final day rolls around, well, it’ll be just fine for ‘em.
So, my dear ones, pray to the Father with all your heart’s energy, that you be filled with this love He’s got for all true followers of His Son, Jesus Christ; so you can be called the sons of God; when He finally shows up, we’ll be like Him, cause we’ll see Him as He is; that’s the hope we hold; we’ll be cleaned up just like He’s clean. Amen.
