Jesus handed the twelve Nephite wranglers the ability to rustle up the gift of the Holy Spirit. 'Round A.D. 401–21.
The words of Christ, which he gave to his chosen posse, the twelve he’d picked out, when he placed his hands on 'em—
And he called each of 'em by name, sayin’: Y’all gotta call on the Father in my name, with prayers as strong as a stampede; and after y’all done this, you’ll have the power that whoever you lay your hands on, you’ll be givin’ the Holy Spirit; and in my name y’all will do it, ‘cause that’s how my apostles roll.
Now Christ shot these words at ‘em when he first showed up; the crowd didn’t catch it, but the disciples sure did; and on as many as they laid their hands, the Holy Spirit come upon ‘em.
