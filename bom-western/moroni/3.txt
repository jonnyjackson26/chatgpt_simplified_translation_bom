The way them disciples, called the elders of the church, went 'bout ordainin' priests and teachers—
Once they had a good talk with the Father in the name of Christ, they placed their hands on 'em and proclaimed:
In the name of Jesus Christ, I’m makin' you a priest (or if yer a teacher, I’m makin' you a teacher) to spread the word of repentance and the forgivin' of sins through Jesus Christ, holdin' on to faith in his name till the very end. Amen.
And that's how they set apart priests and teachers, keepin' in line with the gifts and callin's of God for folks; and they done it with the power of the Holy Ghost that stirred within 'em.
