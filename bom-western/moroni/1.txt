Well now, I’m Moroni, and after finishin' up the tale of the folks from Jared, I thought I’d hang up my hat for good. But since I ain't kicked the bucket just yet, I better keep a low profile ‘round them Lamanites, or they might just rustle me up for good.
Y'see, them wars they got goin' are hotter than a firebrand, and their hatred runs deeper than a rattlesnake's hole. They'll shoot down any Nephite who won’t turn their back on Christ.
And I, Moroni, ain't the type to back down from my faith; so I’m ridin’ the trail wherever I can to keep my hide safe and sound.
So I reckon I’ll pen a few more thoughts, despite thinkin’ I was done for good; I figured I wasn’t gonna write anythin’ else. But I’m a-gatherin' a few more words, hopin’ they might just do my Lamanite kin some good someday, if it’s in the good Lord's plan.
