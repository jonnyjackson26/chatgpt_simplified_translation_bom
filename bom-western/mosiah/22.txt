Well now, Ammon and King Limhi got together, chewin' the fat with the folks about how they might break free from their shackles; so they hollered for everyone to gather round, wantin’ to hear what the folks had to say on the matter.
But they couldn't rustle up any way to break free, 'cept to take their women and young’uns, their cattle and critters, and their tents, and skedaddle out into the wilds; 'cause the Lamanites were thick as flies, makin’ it downright impossible for Limhi's bunch to take 'em on with steel.
Now Gideon, that brave soul, stepped up before the king and told him: "Now listen here, King, you've lent an ear to my chatter plenty of times when we've been squarin' off against those Lamanite fellers."
And he continued, "O king, if I've been a useful hand around here, or if my words have done ya any good at all, I reckon it’d be mighty fine if you’d lend an ear to me this time, as I aim to help free this here people from their chains."
The king nodded, givin' him the go-ahead to speak. Gideon then drawled:
"Now pay heed, there's a back trail through the rear wall, on the far side of town. The Lamanites and their sentries are on a real bender at night; so let’s send out word for all the folks to gather up their livestock and get 'em movin’ into the hills after dark."
"I’ll do what you say and deliver the last barrel of wine to the Lamanites, and they'll be three sheets to the wind; then we can slip through the secret way on the left of their camp while they’re snoozin’ hard."
"We’ll take off with our women and young'uns, our cattle and gear into the wild; then we’ll circle around the territory of Shilom."
The king perked up and paid heed to Gideon's words.
So King Limhi got his people movin' to round up their livestock; he sent that tribute of wine to the Lamanites and added even more as a gift; they guzzled that wine down like a desert cactus with rain.
And thus, Limhi's folks took off under the cover of night into the wilderness with their flocks and herds, skirtin’ round the land of Shilom, makin’ their way toward Zarahemla, with Ammon and his posse guidin’ the way.
They packed all their gold and silver and precious belongings they could haul, along with their grub, and hit the trail.
After a good spell out in the wilds, they made it to Zarahemla, joinin' up with Mosiah’s folks, becoming part of his crew.
When Mosiah laid eyes on ‘em, he welcomed ‘em with open arms; and he also accepted their records alongside them old scrolls from Limhi's lot.
Now, when the Lamanites got wind that Limhi’s folks had snuck off into the night, they sent a whole battalion out into the wild to track 'em down.
After two whole days of tryin’ to sniff 'em out, they were at a loss and couldn’t follow their trail; they got themselves lost in the wilderness.
