Well now, it came to be that Alma, who’d skipped out on King Noah’s henchmen, had himself a change of heart ‘bout his misdeeds and wrongdoings. He started wanderin’ around quietly among folks and yappin’ about the words of Abinadi—
Yup, talkin’ ‘bout what was comin’ next, and also the whole resurrection deal, and how folks were gonna be redeemed, all thanks to the power, sufferin’, and death of Christ, followed up by his risin’ up and takin’ a trip up to heaven.
And all who were willin’ to lend an ear, he did teach. He didn’t want the king catchin’ wind of it, so he kept things low-key. Many of ‘em believed what he said.
So it came to pass that those who believed hightailed it to a spot called Mormon, named after the king, on the edge of the land where wild critters roamed from time to time.
Now, there was a spring of clear water in Mormon, and Alma made his way to it, findin’ a shady grove of little trees near the water where he could lay low during the daylight from the king’s snoopers.
And it came to pass that all who believed in him made their way there to catch his words.
After quite a spell, a good-sized crowd had gathered at the place of Mormon to hear what Alma had to say. Yep, all them believers came together to hear him, and he preached to them about repentance, redemption, and havin’ faith in the Lord.
Then he said to ‘em: "Look here, folks, these are the waters of Mormon (that’s what they called ‘em), and now, if you’re eager to join up with God’s flock and be known as his people, and are willin’ to bear each other’s burdens light as a feather;
Sure ‘nuff, and you’re ready to grieve with those who grieve; and comfort folks who need a hand, and be witnesses of God no matter where you’re at, all the way to the end of your days, so you might be redeemed and counted among them who rise first, claimin’ eternal life—
Now I’m tellin’ you, if this is really what you want, what’s stoppin’ you from bein’ baptized in the name of the Lord, as a sign that you’re enterin’ into a promise with him, sayin’ you’ll serve him and stick to his commandments, so he can pour out his Spirit more’n generously on you?
And when the folks heard these words, they clapped their hands and cheered: "This here’s what we’ve been hankerin’ for."
Well, then Alma took Helam, one of the first to step up, and waded into the water, hollerin’ out: "O Lord, rain down your Spirit upon your servant, so he can do this good work with a pure heart."
Once he said these words, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he declared: "Helam, I baptize you, authorized by the Almighty God, as a sign that you’ve struck a deal to serve him until your time in this life is up; may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out on you; and may he grant you eternal life through the redemption of Christ, who’s been ready since the world began."
And after Alma finished speakin’, both he and Helam were dunked in the water; then they popped back up, filled with joy and the Spirit.
And then Alma took another feller and went into the water again, baptizin’ him like the first, but he didn’t go under again this time.
And that’s how he baptized every soul that came to the waters of Mormon; there were ‘round two hundred and four of ‘em; yes siree, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon and filled with God’s grace.
From that point on, they were known as the Church of God, or Christ’s Church. It also came to pass that anyone baptized with God’s power and authority was added to this church.
Then Alma, havin’ God’s authority, ordained priests; he set one priest for every fifty folks to preach and teach ‘em ‘bout God’s kingdom.
He gave ‘em orders not to teach nothin’ but what he’d laid down, and what had come straight from the holy prophets.
Yessiree, he told ‘em to preach nothin' but repentance and faith in the Lord who redeemed his people.
He commanded ‘em to keep the peace and not to bicker among themselves, but to look ahead with one mind, holdin’ to one faith and one baptism, havin’ their hearts all tied up together in love and unity.
And that’s how he commanded ‘em to preach. And they were called the children of God.
He instructed ‘em to keep the Sabbath day holy, and to show gratitude to the Lord every single day.
He also told ‘em that the priests he ordained ought to work with their own hands to take care of themselves.
Every week, they set aside a day for gatherin’ together to teach the folks, to worship the Lord, and whenever they could, to meet up.
And the priests weren’t to rely on the folks for their upkeep; instead, they were to earn their keep through their labors, findin’ strength in the Spirit, so they could teach with God’s power and authority.
And once more, Alma commanded that the church folks share what they had; everyone was to give according to their means; if someone had a lot, they were to give a lot; and from those who had little, only a little would be asked; and to those without, they were to give what was needed.
And so they were to share what they had willingly and with good hearts towards God, and lend a hand to the priests who needed it, and every soul that was in need and without clothes.
And he said this to ‘em, having been told by God; and they lived righteously before God, supportin’ each other both in needs and in spiritual ways.
Now it came to pass that all this went down in Mormon, by the waters of Mormon, in the woods near the waters of Mormon; yep, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the woods of Mormon, how fine they looked to those who came to know their Savior; how blessed are they, for they’ll sing praises to him forever.
All this was done where the king wouldn’t catch wind of it.
But lo and behold, the king got wind of folks stirrin’ up and sent his lackeys to keep an eye on ‘em. So on the day they were gatherin’ to hear the Lord’s word, they got spotted by the king.
Now the king figured Alma was gettin’ the folks riled up against him, so he sent his troops to take ‘em down.
And it came to pass that Alma and the Lord’s folks caught wind of the king’s army headin’ their way; so they grabbed their tents and families and hightailed it into the wilderness.
And there were about four hundred and fifty of ‘em.
