Now listen here, partner, Abinadi spoke up to the crowd and said: I reckon it’s important for y’all to catch this: God himself is gonna ride down among folks and save His kinfolk.
And 'cause He wears flesh, they’ll call Him the Son of God, and He's got His body under control, bein' the Father and Son at the same time—
The Father, ‘cause He was made by the power of God; and the Son, ‘cause He took on that good ol’ flesh; thus bein’ both Father and Son—
And they’re one and the same, yep, the Almighty Father up in the sky and down on this earth.
So the flesh bows to the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, bein' one God, takin’ on temptation, but not givin’ in, instead lettin’ Himself be ridiculed, whipped, and cast aside by His own folk.
And after all this, after performin’ many mighty deeds for the folks, He’ll get led off, just like Isaiah said, like a sheep goin’ to the shearin’, He won’t utter a word.
Yep, He’ll be led to the cross and done in; the flesh gonna be laid low even unto death, with the will of the Son swallowed whole by the will of the Father.
And thus God breaks them deathly chains, claimin’ victory over the grave; givin’ the Son the power to speak up for all the folks—
After risin’ up to heaven, filled with mercy and compassion for the people; standin’ between ‘em and justice; breakin’ those deathly chains, takin’ on their sins and mess-ups, savin’ ‘em, and settlin’ the score.
Now I ask y’all, who’s gonna tell of His lineage? Behold, when His spirit’s been made a sacrifice for sin, He’ll see His kin. So what do y’all say? Who’s gonna be His kin?
Listen close, I tell ya that whosoever’s listened to the prophets, all them holy messengers who spoke ‘bout the coming of the Lord—I tell ya all those who’ve paid heed to their words, believed the Lord would save His folks, and been lookin’ ahead to that day for a clean slate, I tell ya, these here are His kin, or heirs of the kingdom of God.
‘Cause these are the ones whose sins He’s carried; these are the ones He’s died for, to free ‘em from their mess-ups. Now, ain’t they His kin?
Yep, and are not the prophets, each and every one who’s opened their mouth to prophesy, who ain’t gotten tangled up in sin, all them holy prophets since the dawn of time? I tell ya, they’re His kin.
And these are the ones who’ve shouted peace, brought good news, proclaimed salvation; and called out to Zion: Your God reigns!
And oh, how mighty fine were their boots on the mountaintops!
And again, how mighty fine are those boots on the mountaintops of them still shoutin’ peace!
And again, how mighty fine are the boots on the mountaintops of those who’ll keep on shoutin’ peace, from now on and evermore!
And lookey here, this ain't the end, ‘cause oh how fine are the boots on the mountains of the one bringin’ good news, the founder of peace, yep, the Lord who’s saved His people; the very one who’s handed out salvation to His folks;
‘Cause if it weren’t for the redemption He’s done for His kin, which was set in motion from the very start, I tell ya, without this, all mankind would’ve been done for.
But look here, the deathly chains are gonna be busted, and the Son reigns, holdin’ the power over the dead; so He’s bringin’ forth the resurrection of the dead.
And there’s gonna be a resurrection, a first resurrection; yep, a rising of those who’ve been, those who are, and those who’ll be, up to the resurrection of Christ—yep, He’s the one they’ll call.
And now, all them prophets, and all who’ve taken their words to heart, or followed God’s commandments, will rise up in that first resurrection; so they’re the first resurrection.
They’re raised to hang with God, who’s saved ‘em; so they’ve got eternal life through Christ, who’s broken them deathly chains.
And these are the ones gettin’ in on that first resurrection; and they’re those who’ve passed on before Christ came, not knowin’ salvation’s story. Thus the Lord makes ready these folks; and they’ve got a share in the first resurrection, or eternal life, bein’ redeemed by the Lord.
And them little ones also got eternal life.
But mind your manners, tremble ‘fore God, ‘cause you oughta be shakin’; for the Lord don’t save none who rebel against Him and die in their sins; yep, every last one who’s perished in their sins since the world began, those who’ve knowingly rebelled against God, knowing His commandments and flat-out ignoring ‘em; these ones ain’t got no share in the first resurrection.
So shouldn’t ya be tremblin’? ‘Cause salvation ain’t comin’ to folks like that; the Lord don’t save none like ‘em; nope, He can’t deny Himself; can’t overlook justice when she comes a-callin’.
Now listen up, I’m tellin’ ya, the time’s gonna come when the Lord’s salvation will be shouted out to every nation, kinfolk, tongue, and folk.
Y’all better believe, the watchmen of the Lord are gonna raise their voices; together they’ll sing; ‘cause they’ll see eye to eye when the Lord brings Zion back.
Break out in joy, sing together, you barren parts of Jerusalem; for the Lord’s comforted His kin, He’s saved Jerusalem.
The Lord’s shown off His holy strength to all the nations; and every corner of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
