Well now, when the king heard these words, he hollered at his priests: "Get rid of this fella, and send him to meet his maker; what’s he got to do with us—he's just a few cards short of a full deck."
And they stepped up, tryin’ to lay hands on him; but he stood his ground, sayin’:
"Don’t you dare touch me, or the Almighty’ll bring down the thunder on ya for layin' hands on me. I ain’t shared the message God sent me to share, nor told you what you asked me to; so He ain’t gonna let you take me out this time."
"But I got to do what God told me to do; and y’all are fit to be tied 'cause I told you the straight truth. And again, just 'cause I spoke God’s word, you judge me for bein’ loco."
Now after Abinadi had laid that out, the folks under King Noah were too scared to mess with him, 'cause the Spirit of the Lord had his back; and his face was glowin’ brighter than a campfire at night, kinda like Moses when he was up on Sinai talkin' with the Lord.
And he spoke with the strength and authority givin’ to him by God; and kept goin’ with his speech, sayin’:
"Y’all see that you ain't got the power to take me down, so I’m gonna finish my talk. And I reckon my words are hittin' you right in the gut 'cause I’m layin’ the truth about your wickedness."
"Yep, and my words fill you with a mix of wonder and fury."
"But I’ll wrap up my message; and after that, it don’t matter where I end up, so long as I’m saved."
"But here’s somethin’ for you: what you do to me from here on out will be a shadow of things yet to come."
"And now I’m gonna read to you the rest of God’s rules, ‘cause I can see ya ain’t got 'em written in your hearts; I see you’ve been teachin’ wrong for most of your days."
"And now, remember I told ya: You ain't to make any fancy idols or copy the things up in heaven, or down here on earth, or even what’s swimmin' in the big ol’ waters."
"And again: Don’t you dare bow down to ‘em, or serve 'em; ‘cause I the Lord your God am a jealous fella, checkin' the misdeeds of the fathers against the kids, up to the third and fourth generations of them what don’t like me;"
"And showin’ kindness to thousands of them who love me and stick to my rules."
"Don’t you steal the name of the Lord your God for nothin’; he won’t let ya off the hook if you do."
"Remember to set aside the sabbath day as a holy day."
"For six days you ought to work up a storm and get all your jobs done;"
"But come the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord your God, you ain’t doin’ a lick of work, not you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your hired hands, nor your critters, nor the stranger staying in your midst;"
"'Cause in six days the Lord made the heavens, the earth, the seas, and everything in 'em; so the Lord gave a big ol' blessin’ to the sabbath day and made it special."
"Show some respect for your pa and ma, so your days on this land the Lord your God gives you can be long."
"Don’t you go killin’."
"Don’t you go messin’ with someone else's spouse. Don’t you go liftin’ another’s goods."
"Don’t you be spreadin’ false tales about your neighbor."
"Don’t be a-wantin’ what your neighbor’s got, not his home, not his spouse, not his hired hands, not his cattle, not nothin’ that belongs to him."
And after Abinadi finished layin’ all this out, he asked them: "Have y’all taught these folks to stick to all these rules and keep these commandments?"
"I’m tellin’ ya, No; ‘cause if you had, the Lord wouldn't have sent me to prophesy bad news about this lot."
"And now you’ve claimed salvation comes from the law of Moses. I’ll tell you this, it’s still important to follow the law of Moses for now; but I’m sayin’ that there’ll come a time when keepin’ the law of Moses won’t matter."
"And on top of that, salvation don’t just come from the law; without the redemption that God himself is gonna provide for the sins and wrongdoings of His people, they’ll surely find themselves in a heap of trouble, regardless of the law of Moses."
"And now I’m tellin’ you it was important for there to be law for the kids of Israel, even a right strict one; ‘cause they were a stubborn bunch, always quick to do wrong and slow to remember the Lord their God;"
"So there was a law put in their hands, yeah, a law full of do’s and don’ts, a law they were supposed to follow closely each day, to keep ‘em mindful of God and what’s expected of ‘em."
"But lemme tell ya, all this here was just a foretaste of what was yet to come."
"And now, did they really grasp the law? I’m sayin’, No, they sure didn’t get it; and that’s ‘cause their hearts were harder than a rock; they didn’t understand that there ain’t nobody who can be saved unless it’s through God’s redemption."
"For look here, didn’t Moses prophesy about the Messiah coming and that God would save his people? Yes, and even all the prophets from way back in the day—didn’t they speak about these matters?"
"Have they not proclaimed that God himself would come down among the people and take on human form, striding out in mighty power across the earth?"
"Yes, and didn’t they also say that he’d make the resurrection happen, and that he, himself, would face oppression and suffering?"
