God saves folks from their lost and fallen ways—Those who live for the here and now stay as if there ain't no way out—Christ makes sure there's a resurrection to everlasting life or to everlasting punishment. 'Bout 148 B.C.
Well now, it happened that after Abinadi said his piece, he raised his hand and declared: There's a time comin' when everyone will see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation, clan, tongue, and folk will see eye to eye and confess before God that his reckonin' is fair.
And then the wicked will be thrown out, and they'll have plenty of reasons to howl, cry, wail, and gnash their teeth; all 'cause they wouldn't listen to the Lord's call; thus the Lord ain’t gonna save 'em.
For they’re caught up in their sinful ways, and ol’ devil’s got a grip on 'em; indeed, that no-good snake that tricked our first folks, causin' their fall; which led all humankind to be carnal, sensual, devilish, knowin’ evil from good, and givin' themselves over to the devil.
So, all mankind was lost; and reckon they’d be endlessly lost if God hadn't stepped in and saved his people from their wretched state.
But remember, if a fella sticks to his sinful nature and keeps wanderin' down the road of rebellion against God, he stays in his fallen state and the devil's got full reign over him. So, he’s as good as if there was no way out at all, standin’ in opposition to God; and the devil too is on that same page.
Now, if Christ hadn’t come into this world, talkin' about things to come like they'd already happened, there wouldn't be no redemption.
And if Christ hadn’t risen from the grave and broken the chains of death, so that the grave wouldn't have no victory, and death wouldn't sting no more, there wouldn't be no resurrection.
But here's the thing, there is a resurrection, so the grave ain't got no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.
He’s the light and life of this world; yep, a light that never dims, that can’t be snuffed out; and a life that won’t end, where death ain't got no hold.
Even this mortal body will be dressed up in immortality, and the corruption will put on incorruption, and they'll stand before the judge, to be weighed by their deeds, whether they’re good or bad—
If they’ve done good, it's to the resurrection of everlasting life and joy; and if they’ve done bad, it’s the resurrection of unending punishment, handed over to the devil, who’s got 'em trapped, which is damnation—
They’ve followed their own sinful wants and wishes; never callin' on the Lord while his arms of mercy were reachin' out to them; 'cause those arms of mercy were extended, but they wouldn’t take it; warned about their wrongdoings and yet wouldn’t turn from 'em; commanded to repent and still wouldn’t do it.
And now, shouldn't you shake in your boots and turn away from your sins, and remember that it's only through Christ that ya can find salvation?
So, if you’re gonna teach the law of Moses, you best teach that it’s only a glimpse of what’s comin’—
Teach 'em that redemption comes through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father. Amen.
