Well now, listen up, folks, ’cause I got a bit more to say to ya, so you best lend me your ears; I reckon there's somethin’ coming down the pike that you oughta hear about.
So, all the things I’m fixin’ to share with ya, I got clued in on by a holy messenger from up on high. He said to me, "Get up, cowboy!" and sure enough, I opened my eyes, and there he was, standin’ right in front of me.
He told me, "Wake up and pay attention to what I'm fixin' to share with ya, ‘cause I’m here to bring ya some mighty fine news that'll fill ya with joy."
The good Lord has been a-listenin’ to your prayers and seen how you’ve been livin' right. He’s sent me to let ya know that it’s time to rejoice, and you oughta tell your folks, too, so they can be happy as a lark.
‘Cause let me tell ya, the time’s comin’ real soon when the big boss, the Lord Almighty who’s been around since the beginning and will be forever, is gonna come down from the heavens among us folks, settin’ up shop in a body made of dust, and he’ll be out there workin’ miracles—healin’ the sick, bringin’ back the dead, helpin’ the lame walk, givin’ sight to the blind, and makin’ the deaf hear, fixin’ all sorts of ailments.
He’s gonna be tossin’ out them evil spirits that like to hang around in the hearts of folks.
And lo and behold, he’ll be takin’ on all sorts of tests, payin’ the price in body, feelin’ hunger, thirst, and fatigue, suffering more than any mortal could handle, except right up to the point of death; ‘cause let me tell ya, blood will run from every pore, so heavy will be his grief for the bad actions and the rough ways of his kin.
They’ll call him Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the big cheese of heaven and earth, the one who made everything from the very start; and his mama will be known as Mary.
And he’s gonna come to his own folks so that salvation can reach all us humans if we put our faith in him; but even after all he's done, some folks will still reckon he’s just a regular man, sayin’ he’s got the devil in him, mistreatin’ him, and nails will be driven into him.
But he’ll rise again on the third day from the dead; and at that moment, he’ll be standin’ ready to judge the whole wide world; and all this is done so that a just reckoning can come for the folks down here.
Understand this: his blood cleanses the sins of them that fell due to Adam’s mistake, folks who’ve passed on without knowin’ God’s plan for them, or those who stumbled ignorantly.
But hold on now, woe betide the feller who knows he’s fightin’ against God! Ain’t no salvation for such a one ‘less he turns around and puts his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
And the good Lord sent his holy prophets out to every corner of humanity, lettin’ ‘em know these truths so that whoever believes Jesus is comin’ can wipe away their sins and be filled with joy that’s as big as the sky, as if he’s already here with ‘em.
But the Lord God saw that his folks were a stubborn bunch, so he laid down a law, the law of Moses.
And he showed ‘em many signs and wonders and hints about his arrival; and holy prophets spoke of it too, but still, they turned a blind eye and didn’t get that the law of Moses don’t amount to a hill of beans unless it’s through the atonin’ blood.
Even if little youngsters could mess up, they'd not be damned, and I say to you, they’re blessed; for even as Adam's actions led to a tumble, so too does Christ’s blood wash ‘em clean.
And I tell you straight, there ain’t no other name or way for folks to find salvation except through Jesus Christ, the Lord Almighty.
For he’s the one who judges fair; them little ones won’t perish when they pass on; but folks who know better are damning their own souls unless they humble themselves and take on the spirit of a child, trusting that salvation was, is, and will be found in the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Almighty.
The natural man’s an enemy to God since Adam fell, and he’ll stay that way unless he gives in to the Holy Spirit’s gentle nudges, sheds his rough edges, and claims that saintly identity through the atonement of Christ, becoming childlike—submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willin’ to accept whatever the Lord decides to throw his way, just like a child obeys his father.
And I’ll tell you, there’ll come a day when all people will know of a Savior, spreadin’ through every nation, kindred, and tongue.
And when that day finally hits, the only ones blameless before the Lord will be the wee ones, and folks will only find their way by turnin’ back and puttin’ their faith in the Lord God Almighty.
Even now, after ya teachin’ your folks what God’s told you, they ain’t gonna be any more blameless before the Lord, only on account of what I’ve shared with ya.
Well, I reckon I’ve said what the Lord God laid on my heart.
And here’s what the Lord has to say: These words’ll stand strong as a bright witness against this people on judgment day; and they’ll be judged, every last one of ‘em based on what they done, good or bad.
If they’ve done bad, they’ll face the terrible sights of guilt and the wrongs they’ve committed, causin’ ‘em to hide from the Lord’s presence in endless misery and torment they won’t ever escape; it’s like they’ve taken a swig of damnation straight to their own souls.
So, they’ve drunk from the cup of God’s wrath, which justice couldn’t deny them any more than it could keep Adam from trippin’ up when he tasted that forbidden fruit; and mercy won’t have a hold on ‘em no more forever.
And their torment will be like a lake of fire and brimstone, where the flames can’t be put out, and the smoke keeps billowin’ up for all eternity. That’s what the Lord commanded me to say. Amen.
