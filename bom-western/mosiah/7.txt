Well now, it happened that after King Mosiah had enjoyed three peaceful years without a hitch, he got curious 'bout them folks who took off to settle in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or down in the city named the same; his folks hadn't heard a peep from 'em since they skedaddled from Zarahemla, and boy, they just kept givin' him a hard time with their naggin'.
So, King Mosiah gave the nod for a stout group of sixteen strong cowhands to ride on up to Lehi-Nephi and check in on their kinfolk.
The next mornin’ they saddled up and hit the trail, with one Ammon in the lead, a mighty fella and a hick from Zarahemla; he was the one guidin’ this whole enterprise.
Now, these fellas weren’t sure how to navigate the wilds to reach Lehi-Nephi, so they got lost for a spell, wanderin’ around for a good forty days.
After wanderin’ for forty days, they came upon a hill north of Shilom, and set up camp there.
Ammon then gathered up three of his buddies—Amaleki, Helem, and Hem—and they made their way down into the land of Nephi.
What do ya know, they ran smack into the king of Nephi and Shilom, who had a contingent of guards surroundin’ them, and they got themselves captured and thrown into the slammer.
Two days later, they were dragged back before the king, their bindings taken off; they stood before him, ready to answer whatever questions he had cookin’.
He says to 'em: "Well howdy, I'm Limhi, the young’un of Noah, who's the son of Zeniff. My forebears came up from Zarahemla to claim this land. I got to be king ‘cause the folks voted me in."
And he goes on, “Now tell me, what got ya'll so brave as to swagger up to the city's walls while I was out there with my guards?”
“Now, I let ya live so I could ask ya some questions, or else my guards woulda made sure you didn't see tomorrow. Speak up now, yer free to do so.”
Well, Ammon saw his chance and stepped forward, bowin’ low to the king; then he stood tall and said: “O king, I thank God I’m still breathin’ today, and I get to have my say; I’ll do my best to be bold about it.
‘Cause if you’d known me at all, you wouldn’t have put these chains on me. I’m Ammon, a descendant of Zarahemla, and I came from that far land so I could find out 'bout our kin who were brought here by Zeniff.”
After Limhi heard what Ammon had to say, he was clean overjoyed, sayin’: “Well now, I know for definite that my brothers back in Zarahemla are still kickin'. I’m gonna be joyful, and come tomorrow, I’ll make sure my folks celebrate too.”
“For look here, we’re stuck under the Lamanites’ thumb, and they’ve got us payin’ a hefty toll that’s weighin' us down. But now, it seems our brethren are fixin’ to deliver us from this bindin', and if need be, we’ll be their helpin' hands; ‘cause truth be told, it’s a heap better bein' their servants than coughin' up tribute to the king of the Lamanites.”
Then King Limhi ordered his guards not to chain up Ammon and his pals no more, but to lead 'em to the hill above Shilom and bring their own people into town, so they could eat, drink, and catch their breath after all that travelin’; they had been through a lot, sufferin’ hunger, thirst, and tire from the road.
The next day, King Limhi sent a message throughout all his folks, gatherin’ 'em up to the temple to hear what he had to say.
When they all come together, he spoke to ‘em like this: “O my people, lift up your heads and find some comfort; the time’s nearly upon us when we won’t be under the heel of our enemies anymore, despite all the struggles we've had that went nowhere; yet I reckon there’s still a fight worth raisin' a ruckus for.”
“So lift your heads high, rejoice, and put your trust in God, that same God who was there for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and the one who pulled the Israelites outta Egypt, partin' the Red Sea and feedin’ 'em with manna so they wouldn't perish in the wilderness; He done a heap more besides!”
“Also, that same God has brought our forefathers outta Jerusalem, and He’s kept His people safe up to now; but it’s our wrongdoings and evil ways that’s landed us in this mess.”
“Now all ya’ll are witnesses today that Zeniff, who got made king over us, was too eager to inherit his ancestral land, and he got tricked by the crafty ol’ King Laman, who entered into a deal with Zeniff, lettin’ him keep a piece of land, or even the whole city of Lehi-Nephi, and Shilom, and all around that area—”
“And he did all this just to bring us into servitude. Right now, we’re coughin’ up half our corn, barley, and just about all our grains, plus half of the growth from our livestock; the king of the Lamanites is takin’ half of everything, or even our lives."
“Isn’t that a burden too heavy to carry? Ain’t our affliction a mighty weight? Look, we got plenty of reason to be mournful.”
“Honestly, I’m tellin’ ya, we got a heap to mourn about, 'cause so many of our people have met their end, their blood spilled for nothin’, all 'cause of our wicked ways.”
“If this here people hadn’t gone astray, the Lord wouldn’t have let such a great evil come down on 'em. But alas, they wouldn’t listen to his words; instead, they ended up bickering so much that they'd shed blood among themselves.”
“And a true prophet of the Lord met his end; a chosen servant of God who warned ‘em about their wickedness and prophesied of many things to come, including the arrival of Christ.”
“Because he told them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and he said He’d take on human form, the likeness of man as designed in the beginning; or in other words, that man was made in God’s image, and that God would come down amongst the folks and take on flesh and blood, wanderin’ this earth—”
“Well, because he spoke the truth, they put him to death; and they did many other things that drew down the fury of God upon them. So why should we be surprised they’re in bondage, and dealing with hard times?”
“For the Lord has declared: 'I won’t help my people during their wrongdoing; rather, I’ll block their ways so they don’t prosper; their deeds will trip 'em up.'"
“And he says again: 'If my people are sowin’ filthiness, they’ll reap the whirlwind as a consequence; it’ll be like poison for ‘em.'"
“And one more time he says: 'If my people are sowin’ filthiness, they’ll reap the mighty wind that brings fast ruin.'"
"Now look here, the Lord’s promise has come to pass, and y’all are feelin’ the pain and hardship."
"But if y’all turn to the Lord with a pure heart, puttin’ your trust in Him, and serve Him with all your might, if you do that, He’ll deliver you from this bindin’, just as He wishes."
