Well now, after young Mosiah obeyed his father’s call and hollered a big announcement across the whole territory, folks from near and far gathered round like sheep to hear the words spillin’ from King Benjamin’s lips.
There were so many, I reckon they lost count; they’d multiplied like rabbits and were as thick as flies on a summer day.
They even brought the firstborn critters from their herds to offer up as sacrifices, just like Moses’ law laid out for ‘em.
And let me tell ya, they gave thanks to the Lord, their God, for leading ‘em outta the land of Jerusalem and rescuin’ ‘em from the hands of their foes, puttin’ righteous folk in charge to teach ‘em, and even settin’ a fair king over ‘em, who’d made peace in Zarahemla and showed ‘em how to follow God’s commands so they could be joyful and full of love for the Good Lord and for each other.
So when they finally made it to the temple, they set up camp ‘round it, every man with his family—wives, sons, daughters, and even their little ones, each family strung out separate so’s not to crowd one another.
And they pitched their tents facing the temple door, so they could hunker down and catch every word that King Benjamin had to share.
There was such a crowd that King Benjamin couldn’t fit them all inside them temple walls, so he had a mighty tall tower built so his folks could listen to him up high.
And when he started speakin’ from that tower, not everyone could catch the words ‘cause there were just so many folks, so he had ‘em written down and sent ‘round to those who couldn’t hear him, so they too could get the message.
Now, these are the words he shared and got penned down: "Listen here, my brothers and sisters, all you gathered folks; I ain’t called ya here just so ya can fool ‘round with the words I’m fixing to say, but I want you to really listen, open your ears to hear, your hearts to understand, and your minds to take in the mysteries of God."
I ain’t called ya here to fear me or think I’m anything special beyond any ordinary feller.
I’m just like y’all, struggle with the same aches and pains, both in body and in brain; but this good people chose me and my father consecrated me, and the Lord has let me lead you, seeing to it that I’ve been kept safe to serve ya with all the strength and smarts he’s given me.
I tell ya, I’ve spent my days workin’ for ya, not in search of gold, silver, or any fancy riches from ya;
Nor have I let you folks be locked up in prison, or be made slaves to one another, and I ain’t let any killing, plundering, stealin’, or cheating happen amongst ya; taught you all to keep God’s commands so you could avoid any wickedness, and—
I’ve even worked with my own two hands to help ya out, kept taxes light, and made sure nothin’ bad comes your way, and you all can witness to that here and now!
But listen close, I ain’t done this to puff myself up, nor do I speak it to lay blame on ya; I’m just lettin’ ya know I’ve got a clear conscience before God today.
I say to ya, just because I’ve worked my bones for you, I don’t aim to brag, ‘cause really I’ve only been servin’ God.
And I’m tellin’ you this so you can wrangle some wisdom; servin’ your fellow folks means you’re servin’ God too.
You folks call me your king; if I’m to serve ya, should you not be servin’ one another, too?
And if I—your king—who’s toiled for ya and served God too, ought to get some thanks, oh goodness, how much more should ya be thankin’ your Heavenly King!
I tell ya, if you poured all your gratitude and praise toward the creator of your souls, the one who’s kept ya safe and brought joy to your lives, you oughta do it.
If you served him, the God who made ya from the get-go and keeps you breathin’, allowing you to live and choose your own way, if ya give him your all, yet you’d still be unworthy servants.
He only asks ya to keep his commandments, and he’s promised that if you do, you’ll thrive in this land; he’s not one to change his word, so if ya keep his laws, he’ll bless and prosper you.
Now first off, he created you and gave ya life, and for that alone, you owe him.
And second, he wants ya to do as he commands; and if you do, he blesses ya right there and then; and yet, you’ll still owe him a debt, and always will, so what’s there to brag about?
So I ask, can you boast about anything? I reckon not. You can’t even claim you’re worth more than dust, and yet from that very dust you sprung; but that dust belongs to the one who made ya.
And me? I’m just like you, the king ain’t any better; I’m made of that same ol’ dust. I’m gettin’ on in years and about to lay down this old body for good.
So as I said I’ve served you with a clear slate before God, I’ve called you together so I won’t be blamed, and so your blood won’t come upon me when it’s time to answer for what I was told regarding you.
I say I brought ya together so I can wash my hands of your blood while I’m close to my grave, looking to go in peace, and have my spirit join the heavenly choir in praise of a just God.
And I also want ya to know that I’m here to say I can’t teach ya nor be your king no more;
‘Cause even now, my whole body’s shakin’ mighty bad just tryin’ to talk to ya; but the Lord God’s givin’ me strength to stay upright and has told me to declare that my son Mosiah is now your king and ruler.
Now listen up, my people, I hope you’ll keep doin’ what you’ve been doin’; if ya followed my commands and my father’s, and kept safe from your foes, then so long as ya stick to the commands of my son, or any of God’s law he’ll be passin’ your way, you’ll prosper and your enemies won’t have a grip on ya.
But, oh my people, watch out for squabbles breakin’ out amongst ya, and don’t let that evil spirit my father Mosiah warned about lead ya astray.
‘Cause let me tell ya, a woeful curse’s laid on them that obey that spirit; if they heed its call and die in their sins, they’ll drink deep of damnation for their souls; they’ll earn themselves eternal punishment for goin’ against God’s laws, knowing full well what they do.
I say, there ain’t none among ya, except maybe the young’uns, who haven’t been told about this—every one of ya knows you owe a great debt to your Heavenly Father; you’ve got to give him all that you are and have; and y’all have learned about the records that hold those prophecies spoken by the holy prophets since the time our father Lehi skedaddled outta Jerusalem;
And all that’s been said by our forefathers up to now, they only spoke what the Lord entreated them to, and that’s righteous and true.
So now, I tell ya, brothers and sisters, after learnin’ all this, if you ever stray and go against what’s been told, pullin’ away from the Spirit of the Lord, you’ll lose out on his guidance and blessings—
The man who does this openly rebels against God; he’ll be listenin’ to that evil spirit and become an enemy to righteousness; the Lord won’t abide in him, for he don’t dwell in unholy places.
So if that man doesn’t repent, stays stuck in his ways and dies an enemy to God, the heavy hand of divine justice will awaken his soul to feel the weight of his own guilt, makin’ him shrink from the presence of the Lord, fillin’ his heart with pain, and anguish like a fire that never goes out, burnin’ bright forever.
And I tell you, mercy’s got no hold on that man; his final fate is to suffer endlessly.
Now listen up, all you old-timers, young bucks, and little ones who understand me, I’ve spoken as clear as day so ya’d get it; I pray ya remember the dreadful state of those who’ve fallen into sin.
And too, I’d hope you’d reflect on the joyous state of those who keep God’s commandments. ’Cause ya see, they’re blessed in everything, both in this life and the next; if they hold true ‘til the end, they’ll find themselves in heaven, dwellin’ with God in everlasting bliss. So remember, remember, these things are true; for the Lord God has laid it down.
