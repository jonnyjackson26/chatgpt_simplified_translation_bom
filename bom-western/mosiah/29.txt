Well now, when Mosiah got done with all his thinkin’, he sent word out across the whole territory, askin' folks what they wanted when it came to choosin' a king.
Sure enough, the people answered back sayin’: We reckon Aaron, yer boy, oughta be our king and our boss.
But Aaron was off in the land of Nephi, so that there king couldn’t hand the crown over to him; and Aaron didn’t want no part of that throne, neither did any of Mosiah's other boys set their sights on it.
So, king Mosiah sent another round to the people, a written message this time. And here’s what it said:
Listen up, my folks, or my kinfolk, 'cause I hold ya in high regard—I'm hopin’ you'll ponder the matter at hand 'cause you’re itchin’ to have a king.
Now, I’m here to tell ya that the one who rightly deserves the crown has turned it down, and he don’t want to take the reins.
And if another feller gets picked in his place, I'm mighty worried there’ll be some squabblin’. And who knows if my son, the rightful heir, might get riled up and lead a part of y’all down a path of trouble, startin' wars and fights that’d spill blood and twist the ways of the Lord, causin' many souls to be lost.
Let’s be smart and think this through, for we ain't got any right to be takin' my son down, and we shouldn’t be disposin’ of anyone else who might get picked instead.
And if my son goes back to his puffed-up pride and fanciful ways, he might take back what he once said and lay claim to the throne, which would lead him and y’all into a heap of sin.
So let’s keep our wits about us and look ahead, doin' what’ll bring peace to our people.
So I’ll take the title of your king for the rest of my days; but let’s pick judges to sort things out for this here crowd; we’ll set our affairs in order, appointin' wise folks to pass judgment, followin' God’s commandments.
It’s better to be judged by God than by man, 'cause God’s judgments are always fair, while man’s ain’t always on the level.
If only y’all could have good folks for your kings who’d lay down the laws of God and judge rightly, like my father Benjamin did for all ya—I reckon it'd be a good thing to always have kings lookin’ after you.
I’ve put all my strength and whatnot into teachin’ you God’s commandments and settin’ peace over this land, so we ain't got no wars or fights, no thievin’, plunderin’, murderin’, or any kind of wickedness goin’ on.
And anyone who slipped into iniquity, I made sure they got dealt with according to the law handed down from our forefathers.
Now I’m tellin’ ya, because not every man is just, it ain’t wise to have a king or kings leadin’ ya.
'Cause reckon how much trouble one wicked king can stir up, and the destruction that follows?
Yep, think on king Noah, his devious ways and all the evil his crowd got up to. Just look at the heap of trouble that landed on ‘em; they got themselves shackled because of their wickedness.
If it weren’t for the good Lord up above, and their mighty repentant cries, they'd still be stuck in chains today.
But lo and behold, He set ‘em free 'cause they humbled themselves; they hollered loud enough He came to their rescue and pulled ‘em outta their mess; that’s how the Lord works His wonders among folks, lendin’ a hand of mercy to those who put their trust in Him.
And let me tell ya, you can’t just toss out a crooked king without a whole lotta fuss and a river of blood.
He’s got his shady pals around him, keepin' guard; he tramples on the laws laid down by good kings before him; he walks all over God’s commandments.
He goes and makes his own laws, sendin’ ‘em out to his folks, laws made for his own wicked ways; and anyone who don’t toe the line pays the price, and anyone who stands against him gets his armies after 'em, and if he can, he’ll wipe 'em out; that’s how a bad king twists all that’s good.
Now pay close attention, I’m sayin’ it ain’t right for such filthy ways to come upon ya.
So, it’s best you pick judges by the folks’ say-so, so you can be judged by the righteous laws given by our forefathers, laws that stand the test of time and were handed down by the Lord.
Usually, the folks’ voice don’t lean toward what’s wrong, but it ain't uncommon for a small group to chase after what ain't right; so keep that in mind and make it your rule—everythin’ should be done by the people’s say-so.
And if the time comes when the folks start pickin’ evil, well, that’ll be the time when God’s judgments rain down upon ya; that’ll be when He visits ya with massive destruction like He's done before to this here land.
Now if ya have judges who ain’t holdin' to the law that was given, you can set it up so they can be judged by a higher authority.
If your top judges ain’t makin’ righteous calls, gather a few of the lower judges and have them take a look at those higher-ups, based on what the folks decide.
And I command ya to carry out these things fearfully before the Lord; and I give ya this command: no king; if this crowd steps into sin, it’ll fall back on their own heads.
For I’m tellin’ ya, the sins of many folks have come from the wickedness of their kings; those wrongs lay heavy on the kings’ heads.
And I’m hopin’ for no more injustice in this land, especially among my folks; I want this territory to be a place of freedom, where every man gets to claim his rights and privileges while the Lord deems us worthy to live and own the land, just like long as there’s any of our kin livin’ here.
And Mosiah wrote 'nother heap of things to 'em, layin’ out all the trials and tribulations of bein' a righteous king, share all the soul-wranglin' he faced 'cause of his people, and all the gripin' from the folks to their king; and he laid it all out clear.
He told 'em this kind of thing shouldn’t be; the load oughta be shared by every last one of ‘em, so each man could bear his share.
He also let 'em know all the troubles they faced under a king who didn’t walk the straight and narrow;
Yep, all the wickedness and evil doings, the wars, the fights, the blood spilled, the thieves, and the plunderers, the fornicators, and all kinds of badness that’s just too many to count—tellin’ 'em these things shouldn’t happen, they go against God’s commandments.
And sure enough, after king Mosiah sent this word out to the folks, they saw the truth in what he was sayin'.
So they let go of their hopes for a king and became eager for every man to have an equal shot all over the land; and each one was ready to bear his own sins.
Then they grouped up all across the territory, to cast their votes on who oughta be their judges, to lead ‘em under the law that had been given; and they were mighty pleased with the freedom they’d been granted.
Their love for Mosiah just grew and grew; they held him in higher regard than any other man; they didn't see him as a tyrant hopin’ to fill his pockets, that dirty lucre that spoils the soul; he hadn’t taken their riches, nor did he take joy in bloodshed; he kept the peace in the land, deliverin’ his people from all yonder bondage; so they thought mighty highly of him, yes sir, more than any words could say.
And sure enough, they picked out judges to look after ‘em, or to pass judgment over ‘em according to the law; they did this all over the land.
Then it happened that Alma was chosen to be the first chief judge, bein’ also the high priest, his daddy havin’ handed the office down to him and put him in charge of all the church’s goings-on.
Now it happened that Alma walked in line with the Lord, kept His commandments, and made righteous calls; and he brought about continuous peace across the territory.
And thus the time of the judges started spreadin’ throughout the whole land of Zarahemla, amongst all the folks known as the Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.
Then after a spell, his father passed away, havin' lived eighty-two years, fulfillin’ the commands laid out by God.
And lo and behold, Mosiah also kicked the bucket in the thirty-third year of his rule, bein’ sixty-three years old; that added up to five hundred and nine years since Lehi took off from Jerusalem.
And that’s how the kings’ reign came to an end over the Nephite folks; and that’s also how Alma’s days wrapped up, bein’ the founder of their church.
