In a holler called Shemlon, the Lamanite gals would gather 'round to sing, dance, and have a real hoedown.
One day, a small bunch of 'em got together to raise a ruckus with their singing and dancing.
Now, them priests of King Noah were too cowed to head back to Nephi, feared people would haul 'em off for a hangin', so they didn't dare face their wives and young'uns.
They hung around the wilderness and spotted them Lamanite daughters, settin' eyes on 'em like a hawk.
When just a few of 'em were dancin’, them sneaky priests crept out from their hideouts, nabbed 'em, and high-tailed it into the wild; they rustled away twenty-four of those Lamanite gals.
Soon as them Lamanites noticed their daughters were gone, they got all riled up at Limhi's folk, sure they were behind it.
So they sent their armies rustlin’ forward; even the king himself led the charge, movin' up to Nephi to wipe out Limhi's people.
Limhi caught wind of 'em from his lookout tower, saw all their war preparations; so he got his folks together to lay low in the fields and woods.
When them Lamanites arrived, the folks of Limhi sprang from their hiding spots and started takin' 'em down.
The fight got real fierce, for they were battling like wild beasts for their kin.
It came to pass that Limhi’s crew began to push the Lamanites back, though they were outnumbered; they fought for their lives and families, like dragons defending their nests.
Then they found the Lamanite king among the fallen, still breathin' but wounded, left behind when his folks took off quick as a bunny.
They patched him up and brought him before Limhi, sayin’: “Looky here, we got the king of them Lamanites, he took a hit and fell, but we fetched him for ya; let’s finish him off.”
But Limhi called out, “Don’t you dare lay a hand on him, just bring him here so I can have a word.” They complied, and Limhi asked, “What brings you to war with my people? We ain't broken the promise I made, so why would you break yours?”
The king replied, “I broke my promise 'cause your folks snatched up my daughters; in my rage, I led my people to come after ya.”
Limhi hadn't heard about any of that, so he declared, “I’ll hunt down the guilty party among my folks, and whoever's to blame will face the music.” He ordered a search to be done.
When Gideon, the captain, heard this, he stepped up and said to the king, “Hold your horses! Don’t go searching your folks or lay this mess on 'em.”
“Don’t you remember the priests of your pop, whom your people wanted to hang? They're out there in the wilderness, ain’t they the ones who done stole them Lamanite daughters?”
“Now listen here, pass the word to the king ’bout this, so he can set his people straight with us; they’re already makin' ready to ride down on us, and we got a handful.”
“They’re comin’ in droves; unless the king smooths things over with 'em, we’re toast.”
Ain't it true that them words of Abinadi have come to pass—the whole pickle ‘cause we wouldn’t pay heed to the Lord and mend our wicked ways?
Now let’s calm the king down and stick to our promise; better to be shackled than lose our lives, so let’s stop the bloodshed right here.
Limhi then spilled the beans to the king ’bout his father and them priests that skedaddled into the wild, layin' the blame for the daughters' abduction on them.
Before too long, the king cooled down toward his people and said, “Let's head out and meet my folks, arms down; I swear that my folks won’t harm yours.”
So they traipsed after the king, unarmed, to meet the Lamanites. When they met up, the king of the Lamanites bowed low and pleaded for Limhi’s people.
When the Lamanites saw Limhi’s folks weren’t packin’ any heat, they felt for 'em, calmed down, and rode back home with their king without a fuss.
