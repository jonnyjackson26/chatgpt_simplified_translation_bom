Well now, King Benjamin figured it was high time, after he finished jawin' with the folks, to wrangle up the names of all them who pledged their word to God to stick to His commandments.
Turns out, there wasn’t a single soul there, ‘cept for the young'uns, who hadn’t shook on that covenant and taken up the name of Christ.
So, after King Benjamin wrapped up all his business and set his son Mosiah on the throne, givin' him all the instructions about leadin’ the kingdom and appointin’ some priests to teach the folks, so they could hear and remember the commandments of God and recall that promise they made, he sent the crowd on their way, and they all went back to their homesteads with their kin.
Mosiah started reignin' in his daddy’s shoes, takin' the reins when he hit the big three-oh, makin’ it ‘round four hundred and seventy-six years since Lehi skedaddled outta Jerusalem.
King Benjamin hung on for three more years before he rode off into the sunset.
Well, it turns out King Mosiah walked the straight and narrow, keepin’ to the ways of the Lord, followin’ His judgments and the rules, and holdin’ tight to all His commandments.
And King Mosiah made sure his folks worked the land, and he rolled up his sleeves to do his share too, so as not to weigh down his people, followin’ in his father’s footsteps in every way. And for a stretch of three years, there wasn’t a bit of fuss among the whole crowd.
