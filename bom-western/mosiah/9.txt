Well now, the tale of ol’ Zeniff tells of his folks from way back, when they high-tailed it from the land of Zarahemla and made tracks till they were finally freed from the grip of them Lamanites.
There’s some chapters 'bout all that business—up to 22.
Zeniff took his gang from Zarahemla to stake a claim on the land called Lehi-Nephi—The king of the Lamanites gave 'em the green light to settle there—But trouble brewed ‘twixt the Lamanites and Zeniff’s crew. This all went down 'round 200–187 B.C.
I, Zeniff, learned all them fancy Nephite tongues and had a good map of Nephi, where our ancestors first struck paydirt, and I got sent out like a scout among the Lamanites, spyin’ on their forces so our bunch could catch 'em off guard and take 'em out—but when I laid eyes on the good folks among them, I didn’t want to see ‘em go to the grave.
So I tussled with my brothers in the wild, wantin’ our big chief to shake hands with the Lamanites. But he was a hard-nosed, bloodthirsty cuss who ordered my head on a platter; yet somehow, I was spared through a heap of bloodshed—fathers turnin’ on fathers, brothers on brothers, ‘til most of our folks were wiped out in the wilderness; the rest of us who made it back went to Zarahemla to tell our wives and kids what went down.
Still, me burning to claim our ancestors' land, I rounded up those itchin’ to join and we saddled up again for a trek into the wild, aimed at that land; but we found ourselves dealin’ with a nasty famine and hard times 'cause we were slow to give a hoot about the Lord our God.
After many long days flounderin’ in the wilderness, we set up camp at the spot where our kinfolk met their end, close to the land of our forefathers.
Then it happened that I rode back with four of my boys right into the king’s den, wantin’ to size up the king’s attitude and find out if we could move in with our folks and settle down without a ruckus.
I stepped into the king’s hall, and he struck a deal with me that we could take over the land of Lehi-Nephi and Shilom.
He also ordered his folks to clear outta the land, and so, my people and I moved in to make it our own.
We set about raisin’ buildings and patchin’ up the walls of the city, yeah, even the walls of Lehi-Nephi and Shilom.
We got to plowin’ the fields, sowin’ every kind of seed we could find—corn, wheat, barley, you name it, even neas and sheum, and a whole heap of fruit seeds; we started to grow and thrive in the land.
Now that ol’ King Laman was a sly one, tryin’ to throw my folks into servitude, so he gave up the land for us to stake our claim.
So it was that after twelve years of makin’ our home there, King Laman started frettin’, worried my folks would get strong enough to stand up to ‘em and throw ‘em into chains.
See, they were a lazy, idol-worshippin’ bunch; they just wanted to rope us in so they could feast on the fruit of our labor and chow down on the flocks from our pastures.
Thus, King Laman stirred up his people to pick a fight with mine, and before long, there was a whole mess of wars and bickering goin’ on in the land.
In the thirteenth year of my rule over the land of Nephi, down south of Shilom, while my folks were tendin’ to their flocks and plowin’ the fields, a whole pack of Lamanites swooped in and started whackin’ them, makin’ off with their sheep and corn.
And sure enough, all who weren’t caught ran for cover into the city of Nephi and hollered for me to come to their aid.
Next, I armed ‘em up with bows, arrows, swords, cimeters, clubs, slings—every kind of weapon we could whip up, and my folks and I charged out to face them Lamanites in battle.
Fueled by the strength of the Lord, we went into that fight; I and my crew cried out earnestly to the Lord to save us from our enemies, ‘cause we finally remembered how our ancestors were delivered.
And the Lord heard our calls and answered our prayers; we marched into the fight, and in one day and a night, we took out three thousand and forty-three of ‘em; we kept pushin’ ’til we drove ‘em clean outta our land.
And me, I got busy with my own hands, helpin’ to bury the fallen. It was a mournful sight, for two hundred seventy-nine of our own kin laid dead to rest.
