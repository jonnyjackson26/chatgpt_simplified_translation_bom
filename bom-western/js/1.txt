“On the evenin' of the … twenty-first of September [1823] … I took to prayin' and plead in' with the Good Lord. …
“While I was busy callin' on the Almighty, I caught sight of a light glowin' up in my room, which kept gettin' brighter 'til it was lit up more than a midday sun, when all of a sudden, a figure showed up right by my bed, floatin' in the air, not touchin' the ground none.
“He was wearin' a loose robe that sparkled like fresh snow. It shone brighter than anythin' earthy I ever laid my eyes on; ain't no way any earthly thing could shine like that. His hands were bare, and his arms too, a bit above the wrists; his feet were bare as well, and his legs were too, just above the ankles. His head and neck were also exposed. I could tell he wasn’t wearin' nothin' else but that robe, ‘cause it was open enough that I could peek into his heart.
“Not only was that robe as white as a winter morning, but his whole self was so glorious it was hard to put into words, and his face was truly like a flash of lightning. The room was bright as a lightning bug's glow, but not as bright as right around him. When I laid my eyes on him, I was spooked a bit; but that fear didn't last long.
“He called me by name and told me he was a messenger sent from God, and went by the name of Moroni; that the Lord had a job for me to do; and that my name would be talked about for good and bad across all nations, kinds, and languages.
“He mentioned there was a book hidin' on gold plates, tellin' the tale of the folks who used to live on this here land, and the roots they came from. He also said that the full scoop of the everlasting Gospel was wrapped up in it, as handed down by the Savior to the ancient peoples;
“Also, that there were two stones in silver bows—and them stones, hooked to a breastplate, made what folks call the Urim and Thummim—sittin' with the plates; and havin' those stones was what made folks ‘seers’ in the old days; and that the Lord prepared 'em for translating the book. …
“He told me again that when I got those plates he spoke of—'cause the time for that wasn't yet fulfilled—I shouldn't show 'em to no one; nor the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to folks I was told to show 'em to; if I did, I’d be in deep trouble. While we were talkin' about the plates, I suddenly had a vision and saw exactly where the plates were hidin', clearly enough that I could find my way back when I came to it.
“After this chat, I watched the light in the room start gatherin' around the fella who'd been speakin' to me, and it kept on until the room got dark again, except right around him; when, all of a sudden, I saw a kinda tunnel openin’ straight up to the heavens, and he floated up till he disappeared entirely, and the room went back to how it was before that heavenly light showed up.
“I laid there thinkin' about how strange the whole thing was, wonderin' real hard about what this unusual messenger had told me; when, right in the middle of my thinkin', I noticed my room was startin' to light up again, and in a flash, just like that, the same heavenly messenger stood back by my bedside.
“He started up again, tellin' me the same things he had shared the first time, without a bit of change; once he finished, he warned me about big ol' judgments comin' down on the earth, leavin' a trail of famine, sword, and sickness; and that these terrible judgments would hit the earth in this generation. Once he got done with that, he floated up again like he did before.
“By then, the impressions on my mind were so deep that sleep had skedaddled from my eyes, and I laid there, overwhelmed at what I had both seen and heard. But what really shocked me was when I saw that same messenger back at my bedside again, hearin' him repeat the same things as before; and he added a warning, tellin' me that the devil would try to tempt me (considerin' the tough times my father's family was in), to grab the plates to get rich. He warned me against that, sayin' I ought to have no other aim in gettin' the plates but to glorify God, and I mustn't be driven by any other reason than buildin' His kingdom; otherwise, I wouldn’t get my hands on 'em.
“After this third visit, he floated back up to heaven like the times before, and I was again left to ponder on the oddity of what I’d just gone through; when almost right after the heavenly messenger had lifted off for the third time, the rooster crowed, and I realized dawn was breakin', which meant our talks must’ve taken up the whole night.
“I soon got outta my bed and, as usual, went about my daily chores; but when I tried to work like usual, I found myself so worn out that I couldn’t muster no strength. My father, who was workin’ alongside me, noticed somethin' was off and told me to head home. I started aimlessly to the house; but when I tried to cross the fence out of the field, my strength gave out completely, and I collapsed on the ground, bein' totally unaware of nothin' for a spell.
“The first thing I can remember was a voice callin' my name. I looked up and saw that same messenger hoverin' over me, surrounded by light just like before. He then started tellin' me all that he had shared the previous night, and ordered me to go tell my father about the vision and commands I had received.
“I did what I was told; I went back to my father in the field and laid the whole tale out for him. He told me it was of God, and encouraged me to go and do what the messenger commanded. I left the field and went to the spot where the messenger had said the plates were hid, and ‘cause I remembered the vision so clearly, I knew the place right when I got there.
“Close to the village of Manchester, in Ontario county, New York, there’s a hill that stands out, the tallest one in the area. On the western side of this hill, not too far from the top, under a hefty stone, laid the plates, tucked in a stone box. This stone was thick and got round in the middle on top, then thinner at the edges, so the middle part was stickin' up outta the ground, but the edges were buried deep in the dirt.
“After I moved the dirt, I found a lever, stuck it under the edge of the stone, and with a bit of grunt work, hoisted it up. I peeked inside, and sure enough, there lay the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, just like the messenger said. The box they were in was made by stackin' stones together with some kinda cement. At the bottom of the box were two stones laid crosswise, and on those stones rested the plates and the other items.
“I gave it a shot to take 'em out, but the messenger stopped me and reminded me that the time to bring ‘em out hadn’t come yet, and wouldn’t for another four years; but he told me to come back to that same spot exactly one year from that day, and he would meet me there, tellin' me to keep doin' this until it was time to get the plates.
“Sure enough, I followed the orders, and went back at the end of each year, and every time I found that same messenger waitin' there, and got guidance and knowledge from him at each of our meetings, 'bout what the Lord was fixin' to do, and how His kingdom was gonna run in the last days. …
“When the moment finally rolled ‘round to obtain the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, it was the twenty-second day of September, eighteen hundred twenty-seven, and I went back as I always did to the spot where they were hid, and the same heavenly messenger handed ‘em over to me with this charge: that I had to keep ‘em safe; that if I let 'em go careless, or if I slacked off any, I’d be in a world of hurt; but that if I did my best to guard 'em until the messenger called for 'em, they'd stay protected.
“When I got wise to why I had such strict orders to keep ‘em safe, and why the messenger had said that once I did what I was supposed to do, he’d call for 'em, it was clear—the minute word got out that I had 'em, folks came at me with every trick in the book to wrest 'em from my hands. The persecution got tougher and meaner than ever, and a bunch of folks were always tryin' to get 'em from me if they could. But thanks to the Lord's wisdom, they stayed safe with me, 'til I did what I needed to do with 'em. When the messenger finally called for 'em, I turned ‘em over, and he’s been keepin' 'em safe ever since, right up to this day, the second of May, eighteen hundred thirty-eight.”

The ancient record thus dug up from the earth like the voice of a people callin' from the dust, and turned into modern talk by the gift and power of the Lord as confirmed by divine affirmation, was first shared with the world in the year as The Book of Mormon.
