Well now, listen up, partners, 'cause I’m gonna spin you a yarn about what Jacob, Nephi's own brother, had to say to the good folks of Nephi after Nephi passed on to the great beyond:
Now, my dear brothers, I’m Jacob, and I’ve got me a heavy load to bear from the Man Upstairs, tryin’ to do my job right and clean up your messes, so I’ve come up to the temple today to share the Good Book with ya.
Y’all know I’ve worked hard in my role till now, but today I’m feelin’ a heap more concern for your souls than ever before.
'Cause let’s face it, you’ve been stickin’ to the Lord's word as I laid it out for you.
But hold your horses, 'cause I reckon you best listen to me. With the Lord’s mighty help, I can see right through your thoughts, and reckon you’ve started wanderin’ down the dark path of sin, which is downright despicable to me, and even more so to God.
Yes sir, it pains my soul and makes me shrink back in shame before my Creator to have to tell you about the evil in your hearts.
And it also troubles me to speak with such boldness in front of your wives and kids, many of whom are as tender and pure as a newborn calf, and that pleases the Good Lord.
I reckon they came up here hopin’ to hear sweet words from God that would heal their aching hearts.
So y’all can imagine my burden, forced to holler about your wrongdoings 'cause the Almighty laid this correction upon me, making me fuss about your sins and poke those already hurt instead of offerin’ comfort, while those not yet wounded get jabbed by harsh words instead of feastin’ on the sweet promises of God.
But even with this mighty task at hand, I gotta stick to God’s orders and tell you about your wrongs right here ‘fore the pure in heart and the broken-hearted, all under the watchful gaze of the Almighty.
So I reckon it’s time I lay the truth out plain as day, ‘cause when I asked the Lord, He told me to get my boots on and head to the temple to give the folks the message He’d prepared for me.
Now, listen up, my brothers, this here’s the message I bring: many of ya are on the hunt for gold, silver, and precious stones, and this land, a promised land for you and your kin, is packed full of them.
And the Lord’s been mighty kind to you in makin’ sure you’ve struck it rich; but some of you got more than your neighbors, and now you’re puffed up with pride, struttin’ around like peacocks in fancy clothes, thinkin’ you’re better than the rest.
Now, my brothers, do you figure God approves of this? I tell ya, no way. He’s callin’ you out, and if you keep this up, judgment day’s gonna come knockin’ on your door real quick.
Oh, if only He’d show you just how He can take ya down a peg with a single look!
Oh, if only He’d clear you of this sin and abomination! Will you listen to His commands and not let this pride tear your souls apart?
Think of your buddies as your own kin, and be generous with what you’ve got, so they can enjoy the riches too.
But before you chase riches, you better be chasin’ after the kingdom of God.
After you grab a hold of hope in Christ, riches will come if that's your aim; but you’d best be lookin’ to do good – to clothe the needy, feed the hungry, set captives free, and help the sick and sorrowful.
Now, my dear brothers, I’ve spoken about pride, and if any of you have wronged your neighbors 'cause you were full of yourselves over what God’s given you, what’s your take on that?
Do you think those actions don’t rile up the Creator of all? He sees each soul as precious, so don’t forget that all flesh is just dust, made for the same purpose of keepin’ His commandments and givin’ Him glory forever.
Now I’m wrapin’ this talk on pride, but if I didn’t have to address a bigger crime, I’d be downright tickled in my heart over you.
But let me tell ya, the Word is weighin’ heavy on me about your bigger sins. The Lord’s sayin’ folks are slippin’ into wickedness; they don’t understand the scriptures and try to excuse their wrongdoings, pointin’ at what David and Solomon did.
Look here, David and Solomon had their share of wives and concubines, which the Lord says is a big no-no.
So listen close, the Lord brought y’all outta Jerusalem with His strong hand so He could raise up good folks from the family of Joseph.
Thus, the Lord won’t let you wander off like those old-timers.
So, my brothers, heed the word of the Lord: no man’s to have more than one wife; and no concubines allowed.
For I, the Lord God, take delight in the purity of women, and all that “whoredom” business is an abomination to Me, says the Lord of Hosts.
So, this people better hold onto My commandments, says the Lord of Hosts, or they’ll bring a curse upon the land.
For if I so choose, says the Lord of Hosts, to raise up seed for Myself, I’ll command my folks, or else they’ll need to listen to these words.
For I seen the sorrow and heard the heartache of the daughters of my people back in Jerusalem and everywhere my people tread, due to their husbands’ wicked ways.
And the Lord of Hosts won’t let the cries of the lovely daughters I brought out from Jerusalem rise up against the men of my people.
For they won’t be taken captive just because they’re tender-hearted, unless I visit them with a mighty curse, leading to their destruction; they won’t commit whoredoms like those old-timers did, says the Lord of Hosts.
Now, behold, my brothers, you know these commandments were laid down for our father, Lehi; you’ve known ‘em well, and now you’re in a heap of trouble ‘cause you’ve done things you ought not to do.
You’ve committed greater wrongdoings than the Lamanites, our kin. You’ve broken the hearts of your gentle wives, lost your kids’ trust with your bad behaviors, and the cries of their hearts are rising up to God against you. Because of the harsh word of God aimed at you, many hearts are broken, hurt deep down to the core.
