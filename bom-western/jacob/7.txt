Well now, after a spell of years passin', there rode into the camp a fella by the name of Sherem, and he was among the folks of Nephi.
Soon as he settled in, he started preachin' to the crowd, sayin' there ain't no Christ comin’ 'round. He buttered folks up real nice with a stack of sweet talk, all in the hopes of knockin' down the gospel of Christ.
He worked harder than a hound dog on a hot day, tryin’ to wrangle the hearts and minds of the folks, and he did manage to snag quite a few; knowin' well that I, Jacob, had my faith fixed on the Christ that was to come, he was always lookin’ for a chance to have a word with me.
This critter was sharp as a tack, could wrangle up the talk of the people real slick; so he used all that fancy talk and charm to spin his web, all by the power of that no-good devil.
He hoped to shake me loose from my faith, but I had seen too much, with angels droppin' by to lend me a hand. The Lord’s voice had filled my ears time after time, so I was as steady as a rock.
Then he sauntered up to me, and this is how he spun his yarn: “Brother Jacob, I’ve chased after you to have a word; I hear tell you’re out preachin’ that there gospel stuff, claimin’ it's the doctrine of Christ.”
“You’ve led a heap of folks astray, messin' with the good path of God, forgettin’ the law of Moses, changin’ it into the worship of a fella who ain't due for a few hundred years yet. Now listen here, I, Sherem, declare that's just blasphemy; no man knows what’s comin’ 'round the bend. And that’s how Sherem tussled with me.”
But lo and behold, the Good Lord filled me up with His Spirit, and I laid waste to Sherem's words quicker than a jackrabbit on a hot rock.
I asked him, “You reckon there’s a Christ comin’?” He said, “If there was a Christ, I wouldn't deny him; but I’m tellin’ ya, there ain't no Christ, never has been, and never will be.”
Then I fired back, “Do you believe the scriptures?” And he said, “Sure do.”
I told him, “Well then, you ain't understandin’ a lick of ‘em; they scream of Christ. Ain't no prophet wrote or prophesied without pointin' to this here Christ.”
“And that ain't all—it's been made clear to me; I’ve heard and I’ve seen; got the Spirit of the Holy Ghost showin' me it's true; if there ain't no atonement made, folks be lost as a goose in a snowstorm.”
Then he said to me, “Show me a sign with that Holy Ghost power you lot brag about so much.”
I replied, “Who do I reckon I am to go temptin’ the Lord to show ya a sign for somethin’ you already know is true? You'll just deny it 'cause you’re in league with the devil. But let it be known, not my will but Yours, Lord; if God decides to smite you, let that be your sign He’s got power in heaven and on earth, and that the Christ will come.”
So I finished up what I had to say, and the power of the Lord hit him like a ton of bricks, and he went down flat as a pancake. He lay there nursin’ himself for quite a few days.
When the time came, he told the folks to gather ‘round the next day, sayin' he’d be kickin' the bucket; and he wanted to share some words with ‘em before he took his leave.
Sure enough, the next day the crowd was all gathered, and he spoke his piece, takin’ it back and confessin’ the Christ, along with the power of the Holy Ghost and the angels that did minister.
He laid it down plain that he’d been led astray by the devil’s hand; talked of hellfire, infinity, and the punishment that don’t quit.
He said, “I fear I’ve gone and committed a grave sin 'cause I lied to God; I denied the Christ, but said I believed the scriptures, and those scriptures surely tell of Him. ‘Cause I lied, I dread my fate might be mighty grim; but I confess to God.”
And as soon as he finished spillin’ his guts, he couldn't say another word and breathed his last.
When the onlookers saw him speakin’ like that just before he bit the dust, they were more than a little shocked; the power of God washed over ‘em, knockin’ 'em down to the ground.
Now, this struck me right in the heart, Jacob, ‘cause I had called out to my Father in heaven; He’d heard my cry and answered my prayer.
Then peace and the love of God came back over the folks, and they dove back into the scriptures, payin' no more mind to that wicked feller’s words.
Folks got to work thinkin' up ways to bring the Lamanites back to the truth; but all them efforts were wasted, 'cause they thrived on fightin’ and bloodshed, harbin' a deep loathing for us, their kin. They kept on tryin’ to wipe us off the map.
So the Nephites took up arms and fortified against 'em, holdin’ fast to the God who was their rock of salvation; they turned into conquerors of their foes.
As for me, Jacob, I started feelin’ my age weighin' down on me; my folks’ record is kept on them other Nephite plates, so I reckon it’s time to wrap up this here record, sayin' that time’s flown by like a tumbleweed in the wind, and our lives slipped away like a fever dream. We were a lonesome and solemn folk, wanderers chased out from Jerusalem, born into trials, and cut up by our own kin, which led to many a ruckus; so we mourned our days away.
Lastly, I, Jacob, saw the end of my trail was near; so I told my son Enos, “Take these plates.” I filled him in on what my brother Nephi had commanded me, and he promised to follow those commands. So I signed off on this part of my writin', which wasn't much, and to all them readers I tip my hat, hopin’ plenty of my kin folks take a gander at my words. Farewell, brothers.
