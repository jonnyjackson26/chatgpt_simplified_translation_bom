Hear ye all yonder nations, clans, tongues, and folks who’ll come across this here work: Joseph Smith, Jr., the feller who put this here story together, showed us them shiny plates folks been yappin’ about, lookin’ all gold-like; and we got to lay our hands on as many pages as he done translated; we also laid eyes on them engravings, all lookin’ mighty ancient and crafty. Now, we’re here to set the record straight with all due seriousness; that Smith feller showed us these plates, ‘cause we’ve hefted ‘em and know for sure he’s got the real deal. We’re puttin’ our names out there for the world to see, testifyin’ to what we laid our eyes on. And we ain’t tellin’ no tall tales, with God as our witness.
