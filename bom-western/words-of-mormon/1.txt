Mormon's puttin' together them big ol' plates of Nephi—He’s throwin’ the small plates in with the rest of 'em—King Benjamin's settlin' things down in the territory. This here’s about A.D. 385.
Now I, Mormon, 'fore I hand over this record I've been stitchin’ together to my boy Moroni, I reckon I’ve seen nearly all the goin’s-on that brought down my kinfolk, the Nephites.
It’s been many years since Christ rode into town that I’m givin' these records to my son; I figure he’ll get to see the whole shebang come to an end for our folks. But may the Good Lord let him stick around long enough to scrawl down a thing or two about ‘em, and maybe even about Christ, hopin’ it’ll be of some help one day.
Now, ‘bout what I’ve scribbled down; after I whittled down the plates of Nephi, right ‘til the days of King Benjamin—Amaleki had a thing or two to say ‘bout him—I dug through the records that landed in my lap, and I came across these plates. They held a small tale of the prophets, all the way from Jacob to the reign of King Benjamin, along with a heap of words from Nephi.
And the words on these plates sit real good with me, ‘specially the prophecies 'bout Christ comin’ round; my folks know many of 'em have come true; I also know that everything that's been foretold ‘bout us up until now has happened, and anything that’s yet to come will surely roll around—
So I picked these bits to finish up my story, usin’ what’s left of my record from the plates of Nephi; can’t hardly put down a hundredth of what’s went on with my folks.
But listen here, I’m takin’ these plates, full of prophesies and revelations, and stickin’ ‘em alongside the rest, ‘cause they’re gold to me; and I reckon my brothers will think the same.
I’ve got a mighty fine reason for doin’ this; it’s what the Spirit of the Lord’s been whisperin’ to me. Now, I don’t know everything; but the Lord knows all that’s comin’ down the pike; that’s why He’s pushin’ me to follow His lead.
And I’m prayin’ to God about my kin, hopin’ they’ll find their way back to knowin’ the Lord, yeah, Jesus’ redemptive grace; so they can once again be a merry bunch.
Now I, Mormon, am fixin’ to wrap up my tale taken from the plates of Nephi; makin’ it down with the smarts and understandin’ God’s given me.
So it went that after Amaleki handed these plates over to King Benjamin, he took ‘em and mixed ‘em in with the other plates, the ones that got passed down from king to king, ‘til the days of King Benjamin.
And they were passed on from King Benjamin’s day, from one generation to the next, ‘til they found their way into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to the Lord they stay safe from now on. I know they’ll be safe; there’s mighty important stuff writ on ‘em, by which my people and their kinfolk will be judged at that great last showin’, by the Good Book’s word.
Now, ‘bout this King Benjamin—he had his share of squabbles among his folks.
And it came to pass that the Lamanite armies rode down from the land of Nephi, lookin’ to clash with his people. But lo and behold, King Benjamin rallied up his forces, stood tall ‘gainst 'em, and fought with all the brawn he had, wieldin’ the sword of Laban.
With the Lord’s strength, they tussled with their foes, takin’ down many thousands of Lamanites. They kept on fightin' till they pushed the Lamanites right outta their rightful lands.
Then there came a time after a heap of false Christs had shown up, their mouths zipped tight, payin' for their wrongdoings;
And after a slew of false prophets and preachers had stirred up trouble among the crowd, all of ‘em takin’ their licks for their crimes; after a whole lotta fussin’ and wranglin’ pushin’ some folks away to the Lamanites, it came to pass that King Benjamin, along with the holy prophets among his people—
‘Cause see, King Benjamin was a holy man, reignin’ over his folks in right ways; there were plenty of holy men in the land, speakin’ the word of God with power and authority, and they didn’t hold back ‘cause the people were as stubborn as a mule—
So, with the help of these good men, King Benjamin, givin’ it his all with every fiber of his being, and alongside the prophets, he restored peace to the land once more.
