Well now, that year rolled 'round again, and a fresh dust-up started between the Nephites and the Lamanites. Even though I was young, I was a tall drink of water, and so the folks of Nephi chose me to ride at the front as their captain, leading the charge.
So, it came to pass that I turned sixteen and rode forth leading an army of Nephites against the Lamanites, which meant three hundred and twenty-six moons had come and gone.
In the year that marked three hundred and twenty-seven, those Lamanites came at us with a force so mighty it sent shivers down the spines of my troops; they wouldn’t stand and fight, instead making tracks back towards the northern range.
We hit the town of Angola, took hold of the place, and got ready to hunker down against those Lamanite scoundrels. We put up defenses with all our might, but despite our efforts, the Lamanites overran us and forced us out of that city.
They sure enough pushed us right out of the land of David too.
So we rolled out again and found ourselves in the land of Joshua, which hung just west by the sea.
We hurried to round up our folk, trying to gather 'em up as quick as a jackrabbit so we could all stand together.
But wouldn't ya know it, the land was crawling with thieves and Lamanites; and even with all the destruction stalking my people, they wouldn’t turn from their wicked ways; thus blood and havoc spread like wildfire all over the place, affecting both Nephites and Lamanites alike, a full-on cycle of chaos throughout the land.
Now the Lamanites had themselves a king named Aaron, and he came storming at us with a battalion of forty-four thousand. I stood my ground with forty-two thousand, and by gum, I sent him packing back to wherever he came from. This all took place while three hundred and thirty years ticked away.
Then the Nephites started to see the error of their ways, crying out just like the old prophet Samuel said they would; 'cause shoot, no one could hang onto their own when all those thieves, robbers, murderers, sorcerers, and witchdoctors were running amok.
And so, a lamentation blanketed the land due to all this misdeed, especially heavy among the Nephites.
When I, Mormon, witnessed their weeping and wailing before the Lord, my heart felt a flicker of joy, thinking of the Lord's mercies and patience with ‘em, hoping they might turn back to bein’ a righteous bunch.
But oh, that joy turned sour, 'cause their sorrow wasn’t a repentance, but a despair that came from their sinful ways, since the Lord wouldn’t let ‘em enjoy their wrongdoings forever.
They didn’t come to Jesus with humbled hearts and contrite spirits; no, they cursed God and longed for the sweet release of death, even while grappling with their swords to keep on living.
My sorrow returned heavier than a saddle bag, seeing how their time for grace had slipped away, both here on earth and in their souls; for I laid eyes on thousands of 'em cut down in open rebellion against God, laid low like dung left to rot on the land. And thus three hundred and forty-four years passed on by.
So it was in the year three hundred and forty-five that the Nephites started to skedaddle from the Lamanites; they were chased all the way to the land of Jashon before we could rein ‘em in.
The city of Jashon was close to the spot where Ammaron had stashed the records, safe from being destroyed. I followed Ammaron’s instructions, fetched the plates of Nephi, and made a record just as he had said.
On those plates of Nephi, I laid out all the wickedness and foul deeds, but I held back from going into the full details of their evils, ‘cause I've seen a non-stop parade of wickedness ever since I first opened my eyes to the ways of folks.
And woe is me over their wickedness; my heart’s been heavy with their sins my whole life; but deep down, I know I’ll be lifted up on the last day.
In that same year, the Nephites found themselves hunted and driven once more. We were pushed onward until we made our way up north to the land called Shem.
We fortified the city of Shem and gathered our people as much as we could, hopin’ to save ‘em from ruin.
And it came to pass in the year three hundred and forty-six, the Lamanites came at us once again.
I rallied my people, urging ‘em with all my strength to stand their ground against the Lamanites and fight for their wives, their young'uns, their homes, and their lives.
My words lit a spark in them enough that they stood tall, refusing to run from the Lamanites.
So we squared off with an army of thirty thousand against fifty thousand, and by thunder, we held our ground firm enough to send ‘em scurrying.
Once they took off, we chased ‘em down, met ‘em again, and gave ‘em a proper thrashing; but I’ll tell ya, the strength of the Lord wasn’t on our side; we were all alone, and it seemed the Spirit of the Lord had packed up and left us, leaving us weak just like our brethren.
My heart ached over the calamity befalling my people, caused by their wickedness and shameless acts. But we gathered our grit and went back against the Lamanites and those Gadianton rogues until we reclaimed the lands passed down to us.
And so the year three hundred and forty-nine slipped by. In the year three hundred and fiftieth, we struck a deal with the Lamanites and the Gadianton bandits, sorting out the lands we inherited.
The Lamanites cut us a deal for the northward land, clear up to the slim passage leadin’ into the southern territory, and we gave 'em all the land down south.
