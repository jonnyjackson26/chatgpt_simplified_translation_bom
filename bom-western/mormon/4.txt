War and bloodshed keep rollin' on—The wicked get their comeuppance from their own kind—The bad guys run wilder than a pack of wolves throughout all Israel—Women and young'uns are tossed to idols like last season's cattle—The Lamanites start throwin' the Nephites around like tumbleweeds. We're talkin' about the years about A.D. 363 to 375.
Well, it turned out that in the year three hundred sixty-three, them Nephites rode outta the desolate lands with their armies to throw down against the Lamanites.
But lo and behold, they got pushed back right quick to that same ol’ land of Desolation. Just when they thought they could catch their breath, another fresh wave of Lamanite warriors thundered in; it was a ruckus so fierce that the Lamanites set up camp in the city of Desolation, puttin' many Nephites in their graves, and takin' a heap of 'em captive.
The ones that got away high-tailed it to join the folks in the city of Teancum, which was sittin' pretty close to the sea and near that Desolation place.
Now, it was ‘cause the Nephite armies went lookin' for trouble with the Lamanites that they got their boots stuck; if they’d stayed put, them Lamanites wouldn’t have had a lick of power over ‘em.
But mark my words, God's reckonin' is gonna catch up with the wicked; they end up doin' the dirty work themselves, stirrin' folks up to spill blood left and right.
Then, it came to pass that the Lamanites started makin' ready to charge the city of Teancum.
And so it happened in the year three hundred sixty-four, the Lamanites rode against Teancum, fixin' to claim that city too.
But alas, the Nephites put up a fight and sent them Lamanites packin'. When the Nephites saw they'd driven 'em off, they started puffin' out their chests, struttin' about in their own strength, and took back hold of the city Desolation.
Now, all this here had transpired, and thousands had met their maker on both sides, both Nephites and Lamanites alike.
In the year three hundred sixty-six, the Lamanites were back again lookin' for a brawl with the Nephites; still, the Nephites were too thick-headed to mend their wicked ways and kept on with their mischief.
And let me tell ya, it’s somethin' else to try and paint a picture or put into words just how horrible the blood and guts were flowing on both sides, Nephites and Lamanites; every heart turned to stone, findin' joy in shed blood like it was Sunday dinner.
There hadn’t been such a heap of wickedness among Lehi's offspring, nor in the whole house of Israel, as the good Lord Himself had ever laid eyes on, as what was goin' on with this crowd.
Then, the Lamanites took over the city Desolation, and you bet it was 'cause they far outnumbered the Nephites.
They marched right on against the city Teancum, shovin' folks outta their homes and takin' prisoners, men, women, and little ones, servin' 'em up to their idol gods like offerings at a campfire feast.
And in the year three hundred sixty-seven, the Nephites got mighty peaked that the Lamanites had been sacrificin' their women and youngsters, so they stormed against the Lamanites filled to the brim with rage, slammin' 'em hard enough to push ‘em back across their own lands.
The Lamanites didn’t come a-callin' on the Nephites again until the year three hundred seventy-five.
And when that year rolled 'round, they came down mighty fierce against the Nephites, bringin' every single one of their boys, too many to even count.
From then on, the Nephites couldn’t get a leg up on the Lamanites no more, startin' to get swept away quicker than dew on a hot day.
Then the Lamanites came down hard against the city Desolation, and let me tell ya, it was a fierce tussle, knockin' the Nephites down again and again.
Fled they did, headin' for the city of Boaz, where they stood their ground like brave cowpokes, but them Lamanites wouldn't go easy, even pushin’ ‘em back after a second go-round.
On the second round, it was a bloody mess—the Nephites got driven back and slaughtered, with their women and children thrown into the fire for idols once more.
Once again the Nephites took off runnin’ from ‘em, draggin’ all the townsfolk along, takin' off from villages and such.
And now me, Mormon, I seen the Lamanites fixin' to take down the land, so I hightailed it to the hill Shim and snatched up all the records Ammaron had stashed away for the Lord.
