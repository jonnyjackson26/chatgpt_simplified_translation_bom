Well now, I, Moroni, am puttin' the finishing touches on what my old man, Mormon, started. I ain't got much left to scribble, but it's what my father told me to do.
After that mighty big rumble at Cumorah, them Nephites who managed to skedaddle down south found themselves on the run from the Lamanites, and, well, they ended up goin’ the way of the dodo.
My father also bit the dust at their hands, leavin’ me all alone to spin this sad yarn about how my folks met their end. But gol-darn it, they’re gone, and I gotta keep my dad's promise. Whether they plan on takin’ me down too, I ain't sure.
So here I go, writin' and stashing these records in the dirt; and where I wander to ain’t of no concern.
Listen here, my dad put together this record, and he laid out his purpose real clear. If I had more space on these plates, I’d join in the writin’, but my hands are tied and I ain't got no more metal to work with, 'cause I’m all on my lonesome. My father's fallen in battle, my kin are all gone, and I ain't got no friends to turn to; how much longer the Good Lord's gonna let me stick around, I can’t say.
Well shoot, four hundred years have passed since our Lord and Savior showed up.
And ain't it a real sight, the Lamanites done chased my kin, the Nephites, from one town to the next 'til there ain’t a single one left; their downfall’s been somethin’ fierce, that's for sure—just look at the wreckage of my people, the Nephites.
It's the hand of the Lord that's been behind this mess. And let me tell ya, them Lamanites are at each other's throats too; the whole dang land’s turned into a blood-soaked battlefield, and nobody knows when this fightin’ is ever gonna end.
Now look, I ain't got much more to say 'bout them Lamanites, 'cause all that's left out here are them and a pack of robbers roamin’ this earth.
And as for knowin’ the true God? Well, the only ones in the know are the disciples of Jesus, who stuck around until the wickedness got so high that even the Lord wouldn’t let ‘em stay with the folks, and we ain't got no way of tellin' if they're still kickin' about.
But I reckon my father and I have seen those disciples, and they’ve lent a hand to our cause.
Now whosoever takes hold of this record and don’t toss it aside 'cause of its flaws will know bigger and better things. I’m Moroni, and if it were in my power, I’d share it all with you folks.
Well, I'm stoppin' my talkin' 'bout this people right here. I'm the son of Mormon, and he hailed from Nephi's stock.
And I’m also the one hidin’ this record for the Lord; these plates ain’t worth a hill of beans, all thanks to the Lord’s orders. He ain't keen on anybody usin' it for personal gain, but the record holds a heap of value, and whoever brings it to light, the Lord's gonna bless ‘em.
Nobody can haul it into the light except by God’s grace, 'cause He's got plans for it to serve His glory, or to lend a hand to His long-lost covenant folks.
And bless the hands that bring this story to life, for it’ll rise from the shadows into the light, just as He said; from outta the earth it shall come, shining bright for all to see, all done by the might of the Lord.
And if there are any flaws, they’re just the flaws of a man. But I reckon none know any fault; still, God sees it all; so watch yourself if you’re quick to judge, lest you find yourself on the hot seat.
And if any fella says, "Show me, or I'll take a whack at ya"—he’d best be careful not to challenge what the Lord has deemed forbidden.
Just knowin', those who judge without thinkin' will find judgment comin' back at 'em, 'cause you’ll reap what you sow; so if you strike, you’ll get struck back, by the Lord’s hand.
Just pay attention to what the scriptures say—man shouldn't lay a hand on another, nor pass judgment, 'cause the judgment belongs to the Lord, and vengeance too, and He’ll see to it.
Anyone who breathes out anger and strife against the Lord’s work and His covenant folks, the house of Israel, and claims, "We’ll wipe out the Lord's work, and He’ll forget His covenant"—that fella’s in deep trouble, likely to face the axe and be tossed into the fire.
The Lord’s eternal plans are rollin’ on, till every last promise comes true.
Dig into the prophecies of Isaiah. I can’t scribble ’em down for ya, but mark my words, those saints who’ve come before us, who owned this land, are gonna cry out, even from the dust; and as sure as the Lord lives, He'll remember the covenant with them.
He hears their prayers, which were for their kin. He knows their faith; in His name, they could move mountains, make the earth quake, and topple prisons; not even the fiercest furnace could harm ‘em, nor any wild beast or venomous snake, thanks to His powerful Word.
And their prayers were also for the one who’d be allowed to bring these things forth.
No one can claim these things won’t come to pass, ‘cause they surely will; the Lord’s spoken it; they’ll rise from the earth by the Lord’s hand, and nobody can prevent it; and it’ll happen when folks claim no miracles are left; it'll come as if someone’s talking from the grave.
And it’ll come on a day when the blood of the saints is crying out to the Lord, ‘cause of secret plots and shady deeds.
Yep, it’ll be a day when God’s power is scoffed at, and churches go astray, all puffed up with pride; even leaders of those churches strutting about, jealous of each other.
Sure enough, it’ll be a day filled with tales of fires, storms, and smoke rising from strange lands;
And there’ll be word of wars, rumors of wars, and quakes in different places.
Mighty pollution’s gonna spread across the earth; there’ll be murders, thievery, lying, duplicitous dealings, and all sorts of wrongdoing; folks will be sayin', "Do this, or do that," and it don’t matter, 'cause the Lord’s gonna support such at the end of days. But woe to those folks, ‘cause they're stuck in the bitterness and snared by iniquity.
It’ll be a day when churches get built that say: "Come to me, and for your dollars, you'll be forgiven of your sins."
Oh, you wicked, twisted, stubborn folks, why have you put together churches for your own gain? Why have you twisted the holy word of God to bring ruin upon your souls? You best take heed of God's revelations, ‘cause the time’s comin’ when all this must come to pass.
Listen up, the Lord showed me some great and wondrous things that are fixin' to unfold when the time’s right for these matters among you.
I’m speakin' to you like you’re sittin' right here, though you ain't. But I reckon Jesus Christ has shown you to me, and I know what you’re up to.
And I see you folks are struttin' around in pride; only a handful ain't liftin' their heads too high, decked out in fancy duds, filled with envy, strife, malice, and all kinds of wrongs; and your churches, oh, they've all become tainted by the pride swelling in your hearts.
‘Cause the truth is, you’re lovin’ money and your fancy goods more than you’re lovin’ the poor, the needy, the sick, and the afflicted.
Oh, you filthy hypocrites, you teachers sellin’ your souls for trinkets that rust away, why have you sullied the holy church of God? Why you ashamed to wear the name of Christ? Don’t you reckon everlasting happiness’s got a bit more value than the misery that nags at you forever, just for a bit of world’s praise?
Why you deck yourselves out in worthless finery while turnin’ a blind eye to the hungry, the needy, and the sick? 
Yea, why you buildin' up your secret sins to rake in cash, leaving widows to weep before the Lord, and orphans mournin’, not to mention the blood of fathers and husbands callin’ to the Lord from the ground for payback?
Look out, the sword of vengeance is hangin’ over your heads; and the time’s comin' real soon when the Lord’ll avenge the blood of the saints on you, ‘cause He ain't gonna let their cries go unanswered.
