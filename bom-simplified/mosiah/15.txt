Abinadi explained to them: I want you to understand that God himself will come down to be among people and will save his people.
Since he lives in human form, he will be known as the Son of God, and because he has aligned his human nature with the will of the Father, he is both the Father and the Son—
The Father because he was conceived by God's power, and the Son because he took on human flesh; this is how he becomes the Father and the Son—
They are one God, indeed, the Eternal Father of heaven and earth.
Thus, the human nature submits to the divine Spirit, meaning the Son submits to the Father, forming one God, who experiences temptation but does not give in, allowing himself to be mocked, beaten, rejected, and denied by his people.
After performing many miraculous deeds among people, he will be led to his death. Just as the prophet Isaiah said, like a sheep going to the shearers, he will remain silent.
Indeed, he will be led, crucified, and killed, with his flesh subjected even to death, as the will of the Son is fully aligned with the will of the Father.
In this way, God breaks the power of death, gaining victory over it; he gives the Son the ability to plead for humanity—
Having ascended to heaven, overflowing with mercy and compassion for people; he stands between them and justice, having conquered death and taken on their sins and wrongdoings, redeeming them and fulfilling the demands of justice.
Now, I ask you, who will speak of his lineage? Truly, I tell you, when his soul is offered as a sacrifice for sin, he will see his descendants. So what do you say? And who will be his descendants?
Listen carefully: whoever has heard the words of the prophets, including all the holy prophets who foretold the coming of the Lord—those who have listened to their words, believed that the Lord would save his people, and looked forward to the day when their sins would be forgiven—these are his descendants, or they are the inheritors of God's kingdom.
These are the ones whose sins he has carried; they are the ones for whom he died to free them from their wrongdoings. And now, can we not call them his descendants?
Yes, and what about the prophets, every single one who has spoken the truth without falling into sin—yes, all the holy prophets from the beginning of time? I tell you, they are his descendants.
These are the individuals who have proclaimed peace, who have brought good news, who have announced salvation; and said to Zion: Your God reigns!
Oh, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring this good news on the mountains!
Once again, how beautiful are the feet of those who continue to bring peace on the mountains!
And again, how beautiful are the feet of those who will in the future bring peace, from now and forever!
And behold, this is not the end. For oh, how beautiful are the feet of him who brings good news, the one who is the source of peace, even the Lord, who has saved his people; yes, he who has granted salvation to them;
For if it were not for the redemption he has prepared for his people since the beginning of the world, I tell you, all humanity would be lost.
But behold, the power of death will be broken, and the Son reigns and has authority over the dead; therefore, he will bring about the resurrection.
A resurrection will take place, the first resurrection; yes, the resurrection of all who have lived, are living, and will live, all the way to the resurrection of Christ—for that is how he will be known.
And now, the resurrection includes all the prophets and everyone who has believed in their messages, or kept the commandments of God; they will rise in the first resurrection; thus, they are part of the first resurrection.
They are raised to be with God, who has redeemed them; and so, they achieve eternal life through Christ, who has freed them from death.
These are those who participate in the first resurrection; and they are those who died before Christ came, without having had salvation proclaimed to them. Thus, the Lord restores them; they will share in the first resurrection, or have eternal life through redemption by the Lord.
And little children also receive eternal life.
But behold, be filled with reverence and fear before God, for you should indeed fear; for the Lord does not save those who rebel against him and die in their sins; those who have perished in sin since the world began, deliberately rebelling against God, knowing his commandments but refusing to follow them; these are the ones with no part in the first resurrection.
So, shouldn’t you fear? For salvation does not reach such people; the Lord has not redeemed them; indeed, the Lord cannot redeem them because he cannot deny himself; he cannot disregard justice when it demands its due.
Now I tell you that the day will come when the salvation of the Lord will be proclaimed to every nation, family, tongue, and people.
Yes, Lord, your watchmen will raise their voices; together they will sing; for they will see eye to eye when the Lord restores Zion.
Rejoice and sing, you desolate places of Jerusalem; for the Lord has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem.
The Lord has shown his holy strength to all the nations; and all the ends of the earth will witness the salvation of our God.
