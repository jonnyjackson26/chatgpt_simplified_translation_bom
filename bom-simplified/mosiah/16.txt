God saves people from their lost and fallen condition—those who are worldly will remain as if there is no way to be saved—Christ guarantees either endless life or endless punishment.
After Abinadi spoke these words, he raised his hand and said: There will come a time when everyone will see the salvation of the Lord; every nation, tribe, language, and people will understand each other and will admit before God that his judgments are fair.
Then the wicked will be cast out, and they will have reasons to cry, mourn, and grind their teeth in anger; this is because they ignored the call of the Lord, so the Lord does not save them.
For they are worldly and influenced by evil, and the devil controls them; yes, even that ancient serpent who deceived our first parents, leading to their downfall; which caused all humanity to become worldly, sensual, and evil, distinguishing between good and evil, and becoming subject to the devil.
Thus, everyone was lost; and truly, they would have been forever lost if God had not saved his people from their lost and fallen condition.
But remember, those who stubbornly cling to their worldly nature and continue to sin and rebel against God stay in their fallen state, and the devil has complete control over them. Therefore, they are as if no redemption exists; they are against God, and the devil stands against God as well.
Now, if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of future events as if they were already happening, there would have been no way for redemption.
And if Christ had not risen from the dead, breaking the chains of death so that the grave could not claim victory and death would not have any sting, there would have been no resurrection.
But there is a resurrection; therefore, the grave cannot claim victory, and the sting of death is overcome through Christ.
He is the light and the life of the world; indeed, an everlasting light that can never be dimmed; and also a life that is eternal, meaning there can be no more death.
Even this mortal being will receive immortality, and this corruptible body will take on incorruption, and they will stand before God to be judged based on their actions, whether good or evil—
If they are good, they will be resurrected to eternal life and happiness; and if they are evil, they will face the resurrection of eternal punishment, being handed over to the devil, who has dominated them, which is punishment—
Having followed their own worldly desires and wishes; having never called on the Lord while mercy was available to them; for mercy was indeed available, and they refused it; even after being warned about their wrongdoings, they chose not to change; and although they were told to repent, they refused to do so.
And now, shouldn’t you be afraid and turn away from your sins, remembering that only through Christ can you be saved?
Therefore, if you teach the law of Moses, also explain that it is just a representation of what will come—
Teach them that redemption comes through Christ the Lord, who is the Eternal Father himself. Amen.
