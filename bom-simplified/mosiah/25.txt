King Mosiah called all the people together.
At that time, there were fewer descendants of Nephi than there were people from Zarahemla, who were descendants of Mulek and those who traveled with him into the wilderness.
There were also fewer people from Nephi and Zarahemla than there were Lamanites; in fact, they were not even half as numerous.
All the people of Nephi gathered together, as did all the people of Zarahemla, forming two groups.
Then Mosiah read the records of Zeniff to his people, which detailed everything from when they left Zarahemla until they returned.
He also read the story of Alma and his brethren and all the hardships they faced from the time they left Zarahemla until they returned.
Once Mosiah finished reading the records, the people who stayed in the land were filled with wonder and amazement.
They were unsure what to think; when they saw those who had been freed from bondage, they felt overwhelming joy.
But when they remembered their brothers who were killed by the Lamanites, they felt deep sorrow and shed many tears.
However, reflecting on God’s goodness and His power in saving Alma and his brethren from the Lamanites made them lift their voices in gratitude to God.
As they considered their Lamanite brothers, who were trapped in sin, they felt pain and worry for their souls.
Some children of Amulon and his brethren, who married the daughters of the Lamanites, were unhappy with their fathers' actions; they no longer wanted to be called by their fathers' names. So, they named themselves Nephi to be identified with the Nephites.
All the people of Zarahemla were considered Nephites because the kingdom was only given to descendants of Nephi.
After Mosiah finished talking and reading to the people, he wanted Alma to speak as well.
Alma preached to the assembled crowds, moving from one group to another, urging people to repent and have faith in the Lord.
He encouraged Limhi's people, who had been freed from bondage, to remember that it was the Lord who liberated them.
After Alma taught them many principles and finished speaking, King Limhi wanted to be baptized, and the rest of his people wanted to be baptized too.
So, Alma went into the water and baptized them in the same way he had baptized his brethren in the waters of Mormon; everyone who was baptized became part of the church of God because they believed Alma’s words.
King Mosiah allowed Alma to create churches throughout Zarahemla and gave him the authority to ordain priests and teachers for each church.
This was necessary because there were so many people that they couldn’t all be taught by one person, nor could they all fit in one assembly.
So, they formed different groups, called churches, each with its own priests and teachers, and every priest preached the same word as it was given to him by Alma.
Thus, even though there were many churches, they were all united as one church, the church of God, preaching only repentance and faith in God.
At this time, there were seven churches in Zarahemla. Anyone who wanted to embrace the name of Christ or God joined the churches of God.
They became known as the people of God. The Lord blessed them, pouring out His Spirit upon them, and they thrived in the land.
