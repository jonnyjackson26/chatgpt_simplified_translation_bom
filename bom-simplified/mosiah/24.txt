Amulon gained the favor of the Lamanite king; consequently, the king appointed him and his brothers to teach the people in the lands of Shemlon, Shilom, and Amulon. 
The Lamanites had taken control of all these areas, so the king had put rulers in charge of them.
The Lamanite king was named Laman, after his father, and he ruled over a large population.
He appointed teachers from Amulon's group in each of the lands occupied by his people, leading to the Nephi language being taught among the Lamanite people.
They were friendly with each other, but they did not know God, nor did Amulon's group teach them about Him, the law of Moses, or the words of Abinadi.
Instead, they taught them to keep records and to write messages to one another.
As a result, the Lamanites started to become wealthy, began to trade among themselves, and grew clever and wise in worldly matters, becoming very shrewd and engaging in all kinds of wickedness and theft, except against their own kind.
Eventually, Amulon started to exert control over Alma and his group, persecuting them and inciting their children against Alma's children.
Amulon was angry with Alma, knowing he had been one of the king's priests and had believed Abinadi's words, which led to his expulsion by the king. Even though Amulon was under Laman's authority, he imposed demands on them and appointed overseers.
Their suffering became so great that they cried out fervently to God.
In response, Amulon ordered them to stop their cries and placed guards over them to ensure no one called on God, with the penalty of death for anyone who did.
Alma and his followers did not openly raise their voices in prayer but sincerely poured out their hearts to God, who was aware of their innermost thoughts.
Then, the Lord spoke to them during their suffering, saying: Lift your heads and feel comforted, for I know the promise you made to me; I will make a promise with my people and free them from captivity.
I will also lighten the burdens on you to the point where you will not even feel them while you are in bondage; I will do this so that you can bear witness for me later and know for sure that I, the Lord God, do care for my people in their trials.
Soon after, the burdens on Alma and his brethren were made light; the Lord gave them the strength to carry their loads easily, and they accepted the Lord's will patiently and joyfully.
Their strong faith and patience resulted in the Lord speaking to them again, saying: Take heart, for tomorrow I will free you from bondage.
He told Alma: You will lead this people, and I will be with you to set them free.
That night, Alma and his group gathered their livestock and grain, working throughout the night to bring everything together.
In the morning, the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall over the Lamanites, including all their taskmasters.
Alma and his people left for the wilderness; after traveling all day, they set up camp in a valley, naming it Alma after their leader.
In the valley of Alma, they expressed their gratitude to God for His mercy, for relieving their burdens, and for freeing them from slavery, as no one else could rescue them but the Lord.
They praised God, with all the men, women, and children who could speak raising their voices in thanks.
Then the Lord instructed Alma: Hurry and take your people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and are pursuing you; leave now, and I will stop them in this valley so they cannot follow.
So they left the valley and continued their journey into the wilderness.
After twelve days of traveling in the wilderness, they finally reached the land of Zarahemla, where King Mosiah welcomed them joyfully.
