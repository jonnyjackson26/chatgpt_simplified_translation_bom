After King Limhi finished speaking to his people, sharing many important things with them, he told them everything about their relatives who were living in the land of Zarahemla.
He called Ammon to stand before the crowd and recount all the events that had occurred to their people since Zeniff left the land, up until Ammon himself arrived.
He also recounted the last teachings of King Benjamin, explaining them clearly to King Limhi's people so they could understand what was said.
Once Ammon finished, King Limhi dismissed the crowd, allowing everyone to return to their own homes.
King Limhi ordered that the records containing the history of his people since they left Zarahemla be brought to Ammon for him to read.
As soon as Ammon read the record, the king asked him if he could interpret languages, to which Ammon replied that he could not.
The king expressed his sadness over his people's suffering and explained that he had sent out a group of forty-three men into the wilderness to find Zarahemla, hoping to ask their brethren to rescue them from bondage.
The group got lost in the wilderness for many days but stayed determined. They didn't find Zarahemla, but returned instead from traveling through a land filled with water and came across a place covered in bones of both men and animals, as well as ruins of various buildings, where they found a people as numerous as the Israelites.
To prove the truth of their journey, they brought back twenty-four plates made of pure gold filled with engravings.
They also brought large breastplates made of brass and copper, which were in perfect condition.
Additionally, they brought swords; however, their hilts had decayed and the blades were rusted. No one in the land could interpret the language or engravings on the plates. So, I asked you: Can you translate?
I ask you again: Do you know anyone who can translate? I really want these records to be interpreted in our language, as they might reveal information about a remnant of the people who were destroyed, from whom these records originated; or, perhaps, they will help us understand the very people who were lost, and I want to know why they were destroyed.
Ammon replied that he could definitely tell the king about a man who could translate the records because he possesses a means to look and translate all ancient records; this ability is a gift from God. These tools are called interpreters, and only those commanded to use them should look, or else they might face dire consequences. Anyone ordered to look into them is known as a seer.
The king of the people in Zarahemla is the one who has this command and this divine gift from God.
The king noted that a seer is greater than a prophet.
Ammon explained that a seer is also a revelator and a prophet, and no one can have a greater gift unless they possess the power of God, which is unique to Him, though people may receive significant power from God.
A seer can know past and future events, revealing all things, making secret matters known, bringing hidden things to light, and explaining things that otherwise would remain unknown.
God has provided a way for man to perform great miracles through faith; thus, he becomes a great help to his fellow beings.
After Ammon finished speaking, the king was filled with joy and thanked God, saying that these plates must hold great mysteries, and the interpreters were certainly meant to help explain these mysteries to humanity.
Oh, how amazing are the works of the Lord, and how patient He is with His people! It is truly sad how blind and unreachable the understanding of mankind is, for they do not seek wisdom nor desire her guidance!
Indeed, they are like a wild flock that flees from the shepherd, scattering and being driven away, only to be consumed by the wild beasts of the forest.
