Abinadi speaks the truth as he faces death by fire, warning his killers about their fate. This occurs around 148 B.C.
When Abinadi finished speaking, the king ordered that the priests take him and execute him.
Among the priests was a man named Alma, a descendant of Nephi. He was young and he believed what Abinadi had said because he recognized the wrongdoing Abinadi had denounced. So, he pleaded with the king not to be angry with Abinadi and to let him go peacefully.
However, the king became even angrier and ordered that Alma be thrown out, sending his servants to kill him.
Alma escaped and hid from them, remaining hidden for many days, during which he wrote down everything Abinadi had said.
Eventually, the king had Abinadi captured again, surrounding him with guards. They bound him and took him to prison.
After three days and discussions with his priests, the king had Abinadi brought back to him.
The king confronted him, saying, "Abinadi, we have found a reason to execute you."
"You have claimed that God will come down to the people, and because of this, you will die unless you retract all the negative things you have said about me and my people."
Abinadi replied, "I refuse to take back the truth I've spoken about your people. I know my words are true, and I've willingly allowed myself to be taken by you."
"Yes, I will endure until my death, and I will not retract my words; they will stand as evidence against you. If you kill me, you will spill innocent blood, which will also testify against you on the last day."
King Noah was going to let him go because he was afraid of Abinadi's words and the potential consequences from God.
But the priests spoke out against Abinadi, accusing him of insulting the king. This made the king even angrier, leading him to hand Abinadi over to be killed.
They took him, bound him, and brutally beat him until he was nearly dead.
As the flames began to burn him, he called out:
"Just as you have treated me, your descendants will make many suffer the same way I am suffering, including burning to death, because they will believe in the salvation offered by the Lord their God."
"You will also suffer all kinds of diseases due to your sins."
"Indeed, you will be attacked from all sides, driven around like a frightened flock by wild beasts."
"On that day, your enemies will hunt you down, and you will face the same fiery death that I am facing."
"This is how God will take revenge on those who harm His people. O God, accept my soul."
After delivering these words, Abinadi collapsed, dying by fire; he was executed because he remained true to God's commandments, confirming the truth of his words with his death.
