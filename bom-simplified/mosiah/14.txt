Yes, even Isaiah asked: Who has believed what we said, and who has seen the power of the Lord revealed?
He will grow up in front of God like a delicate plant, and like a root coming up from dry soil; he wonâ€™t look impressive or attractive; when we see him, there won't be anything about him that would make us want to follow him.
He is despised and turned away from by people; he is a man filled with sadness and familiar with suffering; we hid our faces from him, and he was rejected by us.
Surely he has taken on our grief and carried our sadness; still, we thought he was being punished by God and was suffering for his own mistakes.
But he was hurt because of our wrongdoings; he was beaten for our sins; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.
We have all wandered off like sheep; each of us has gone our own way, but the Lord has placed on him the sins of all of us.
He was mistreated and suffered, but he did not speak out; he was led like a lamb to be slaughtered, and like a sheep that stays quiet when it is being sheared, he did not open his mouth.
He was taken away from prison and judgment; who can speak of his descendants? He was cut off from the land of the living; for the sins of my people, he was punished.
He was buried among the wicked and was given a grave with the rich; though he had done no wrong and had never lied.
Yet, it was God's will to crush him; he made him suffer; when you offer his life as a sin offering, he will see his descendants, he will have a long life, and it will be successful in God's hands.
He will see the results of his suffering and be satisfied; through his knowledge, my righteous servant will make many people right with God, for he will take their sins upon himself.
So I will give him a share among the mighty, and he will share the rewards with the strong; because he has poured out his life unto death; he was counted among lawbreakers; he carried the sins of many and pleaded for the guilty.
