We resumed building our kingdom and began to peacefully settle the land again. I arranged for weapons of every kind to be made so that my people would be prepared if the Lamanites came to attack us again.  
I set guards around the land to ensure the Lamanites couldn't sneak up on us and harm us; this way, I protected my people and livestock from falling into the hands of our enemies.  
We enjoyed the land of our ancestors for many years, specifically for twenty-two years.  
I made sure the men worked the ground, growing all kinds of grains and fruits.  
I had the women spin and weave different types of fine linen and clothing so we could cover ourselves; because of this, we thrived in the land, enjoying consistent peace for twenty-two years.  
Then king Laman died, and his son took over the throne. He began to incite his people to rebel against us, so they started preparing for battle against my people.  
I sent spies throughout the land of Shemlon to find out about their preparations so that I could protect my people from being attacked and destroyed.  
They approached from the north of the land of Shilom with a large army, armed with bows, arrows, swords, daggers, stones, and slings; their heads were shaved, and they wore only leather belts around their waists.  
I arranged for the women and children of my people to hide in the wilderness; I also gathered all the older men and young men who could fight to prepare for battle against the Lamanites, organizing them by age.  
We went to battle against the Lamanites; even in my old age, I joined them in the fight. We approached the battle in the strength of the Lord.  
The Lamanites had no knowledge of the Lord or His strength, so they relied solely on their own might. But they were still a physically strong people.  
They were savage, ruthless, and bloodthirsty, deeply believing the traditions passed down from their ancestors—which said they were expelled from Jerusalem due to their ancestors' sins, that their brothers wronged them in the wilderness, and that they were also mistreated during their journey across the sea;  
And they felt they were wronged in their first land of inheritance after crossing the sea, all because Nephi followed the Lord's commandments more closely than they did—so the Lord favored Nephi, listened to his prayers, and led their journey through the wilderness.  
Nephi's brothers became angry with him because they didn’t understand the Lord’s ways; they were also angry at him on the water because they had hardened their hearts against the Lord.  
Once they reached the promised land, they were angry with him for taking control away from them, and they wanted to kill him.  
They were angry again when he went into the wilderness as commanded by the Lord, taking the brass plates, claiming he had stolen from them.  
This led them to teach their children to despise Nephi's descendants, encouraging them to kill, rob, and plunder them, fostering an everlasting hatred towards the descendants of Nephi.  
King Laman, using his cunning and deceitful promises, tricked me into bringing my people into this land, where they could destroy us; we have endured suffering here for many years.  
Now, I, Zeniff, after sharing all of this about the Lamanites with my people, encouraged them to fight bravely, placing their trust in the Lord; thus, we faced them head-on in battle.  
We managed to drive them out of our land again; we defeated them in a massive slaughter, so many that we couldn’t even count them.  
Afterward, we returned to our own land, and my people went back to taking care of their flocks and farming.  
As I am now old, I passed the kingdom to one of my sons; therefore, I will say no more. May the Lord bless my people. Amen.
