King Benjamin addressed his people and wanted to know if they believed what he had just taught them.
In response, they all shouted in unison that they did believe everything he had said, and they felt sure of its truth because of the Spirit of the Lord, which had brought a significant change in their hearts, making them want to do good instead of evil all the time.
They also shared that, through God's great kindness and the experiences of His Spirit, they had gained deep insights about what lies ahead, and if needed, they could prophesy about all things.
Their faith in what their king had shared with them filled them with immense joy, and they celebrated this profound knowledge they had gained.
They willingly promised to God that they would follow His will and obey His commandments for the rest of their lives, aiming to avoid the eternal suffering mentioned by the angel and not to experience God's anger.
Now, these words were what King Benjamin had hoped to hear from them; he told them that their response reflected what he desired, and their commitment was a good one.
Because of this promise they've made, they shall be called children of Christ, His sons and daughters, as He has spiritually given them new life today; since they say their hearts have changed through their faith in His name, they are now His offspring.
As a result of this, they are made free, and there is no other way to gain freedom. There is no other name by which salvation comes; therefore, all of you who have made a promise with God, I urge you to take on the name of Christ and remain obedient until the end of your days.
Whoever does this will be found on God's right side because they will know the name they are called by: they will be known as followers of Christ.
Alternatively, those who do not accept the name of Christ will be identified by a different name, which means they will end up on God's left side.
Also, remember that this is the name I promised to give you, a name that should never be erased unless you stray; be careful not to transgress so that this name doesn’t fade from your hearts.
I encourage you to keep the name always in your hearts, so you won't be found on God's left side, but rather hear and recognize the voice that will call you, along with the name that He will use for you.
For how can someone know the master whom they haven’t served, or who seems like a stranger to them, far from the desires and intentions in their heart?
Furthermore, would a man take someone else's donkey and keep it? I say no; he wouldn't even let it graze with his animals, but would drive it away instead. The same will happen if you don't know the name by which you are called.
Therefore, I urge you to be steadfast and unwavering, always excelling in good deeds, so that Christ, the Almighty Lord, can recognize you as His, and you may be ushered into heaven for eternal salvation and everlasting life, through the wisdom, power, justice, and mercy of the Creator of everything, both in heaven and on earth, who is God over all. Amen.
