Zeniff gave the kingdom to his son Noah, and Noah started to rule instead of his father; he did not follow his father's good example.
Noah ignored God's commandments and followed his own desires, having many wives and concubines. He led his people into sin and made them do terrible things, including sexual immorality and all sorts of wicked behavior.
He imposed a tax that took one-fifth of everything his people owned, including their gold, silver, copper, brass, iron, livestock, and grain.
Noah kept all this for himself, his wives, and concubines, as well as for his priests and their families; he completely changed how the kingdom was run.
He removed all the priests his father had appointed and replaced them with new priests who were proud and arrogant.
As a result, these new priests lived in laziness, idol worship, and immorality, sustained by the heavy taxes that King Noah imposed on his people; they worked hard to support this wrongdoing.
The people became idol worshippers because they were misled by the flattering and empty words of the king and his priests, who spoke nicely to them.
King Noah built many grand buildings and decorated them with fine woodwork and precious materials like gold, silver, iron, brass, copper, and other valuable items.
He also constructed a large palace and a throne in the middle, made from fine wood and adorned with gold and silver.
He ordered his workers to create beautiful decorations inside the temple, using fine timber, copper, and brass.
He made sure the seats for the high priests were the most ornate, decorating them with pure gold, and built a railing in front so they could rest while they deceived the people with false and worthless words.
Noah built a tall tower next to the temple, which was so high he could stand on top and see the lands of Shilom and Shemlon, inhabited by the Lamanites, and he could look over all the surrounding areas.
He directed the construction of many buildings in the land of Shilom, including a great tower on the hill north of it, a spot where Nephiâ€™s children gathered when they escaped, using the wealth he gained from taxing his people.
Noah became focused on his riches and spent his time indulging himself with his wives and concubines, as did his priests with prostitutes.
He planted vineyards and built wineries, producing plenty of wine, leading both him and his people to become heavy drinkers.
The Lamanites started to attack his people in small groups, killing them in their fields and while they cared for their flocks.
King Noah sent guards to protect the land, but too few of them were sent; the Lamanites attacked, killing many and stealing their livestock, leading to widespread destruction and hatred against his people.
Noah then sent his armies against the Lamanites, and they managed to push them back for a while, returning pleased with their spoils.
After this success, the people became prideful, boasting about their strength, believing that a small group could defeat thousands of Lamanites; they celebrated violence and the spilling of their brothers' blood, all due to their king and priests' wickedness.
Among them was a man named Abinadi, who began to prophesy, declaring what the Lord had commanded him: He proclaimed woe to the people for their abominations and evils, warning that if they did not repent, God's anger would visit them.
He warned that if they did not turn back to the Lord, they would be handed over to their enemies and subjected to bondage and suffering.
They would come to know that the Lord is their God, a jealous God who punishes His people for their wrongs.
If they did not repent and turn to the Lord, they would face bondage with no rescuer but the Almighty God.
When they call out to God, He will not respond quickly; He will allow them to be struck down by their enemies.
If they do not repent earnestly and plead desperately to God, their prayers will go unheard, and they will not be saved from their troubles, as the Lord has commanded.
When Abinadi delivered these words, the people became angry and sought to kill him, but God saved him from their hands.
When King Noah heard what Abinadi had said to the people, he grew furious and questioned who Abinadi was to judge him or his people, or who the Lord was to impose such afflictions.
He commanded to bring Abinadi before him so he could kill him, claiming Abinadi was inciting anger and division among his people, and so he intended to execute him.
The people became blind to the truth, hardening their hearts against Abinadi's words, while King Noah also turned his heart against God's message and refused to repent of his sins.
