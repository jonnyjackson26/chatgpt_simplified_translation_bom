After king Mosiah experienced three years of continuous peace, he wanted to find out about the people who had gone to live in the land of Lehi-Nephi, as his people hadn’t heard from them since they left the land of Zarahemla, and this made them restless.
So, king Mosiah decided that sixteen strong men could journey to Lehi-Nephi to learn about their fellow Israelites.
The next day, they set off, accompanied by Ammon, a strong and mighty man from the lineage of Zarahemla, who was also their leader.
They didn’t know which path to take through the wilderness to reach Lehi-Nephi, so they wandered for many days—in fact, they were lost for forty days.
After wandering for forty days, they arrived at a hill north of Shilom, where they decided to set up camp.
Ammon selected three of his brothers—Amaleki, Helem, and Hem—and they went down into the land of Nephi.
There, they encountered the king of the Nephites and Shilom, who was accompanied by his guards. The guards captured them, bound them, and imprisoned them.
After two days in prison, they were brought before the king again, their chains removed, and they were allowed, or rather instructed, to answer his questions.
He introduced himself, saying: I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who is the son of Zeniff, and I came from Zarahemla to inherit this land, which is the land of my ancestors. I was made king by the people’s choice.
Now, I want to know why you were so daring as to approach the city walls when I was with my guards outside the gate?
I allowed you to live so I could ask you something; otherwise, my guards would have killed you. Speak freely.
When Ammon realized he could speak, he bowed before the king, then rose and said: O king, I thank God that I am still alive and allowed to speak; I will try to speak boldly.
I’m sure if you had known who I was, you wouldn’t have let me wear these chains. I am Ammon, a descendant of Zarahemla, and I’ve come to ask about our siblings whom Zeniff led away from that place.
After Limhi listened to Ammon’s words, he was very happy and said: Now I know for sure that my friends in Zarahemla are still alive. I will celebrate, and tomorrow I will let my people rejoice too.
For we are in bondage to the Lamanites, enduring heavy taxes that are hard to bear. But now, our friends will rescue us from this bondage, and we will serve them as slaves; it is better to be slaves to the Nephites than to pay taxes to the king of the Lamanites.
So, king Limhi ordered his guards not to bind Ammon or his brothers anymore, and he told them to go to the hill north of Shilom and bring their people into the city to eat, drink, and rest from their difficult journey; they had suffered greatly, facing hunger, thirst, and exhaustion.
The next day, king Limhi sent a message to all his people, gathering them at the temple to hear him speak.
Once they gathered, he addressed them, saying: O my people, hold your heads up and take comfort; the time is near when we will no longer be under our enemies’ control, despite our many struggles that seemed pointless; yet, I hope there's still a fight left in us.
So, lift your heads, rejoice, and trust in God—the same God who was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God who freed the Israelites from Egypt, who led them through the Red Sea on dry ground, and provided them with manna to survive in the wilderness; He has done many great things for them.
Also, that same God led our ancestors out of Jerusalem and has protected His people up to this moment. But it is because of our sins and wrongdoings that we have been brought into bondage.
Today you all witness that Zeniff, eager to possess his ancestors’ land, was deceived by the cunning of King Laman, who made a treaty with Zeniff and took over part of the land, including Lehi-Nephi and Shilom, along with the surroundings—
All this was done solely to bring this people under his control or into servitude. Right now, we pay tribute to the Lamanite king, giving him half of our corn, barley, and all our crops, as well as half of our livestock’s increase; the king takes half of everything we own or our lives.
Isn’t this hard to bear? Isn’t our suffering real? Look at how much we have to mourn.
Yes, we have many reasons to grieve, for many of our brothers have been killed, their blood shed pointlessly, all because of wickedness.
If this people had not turned away from God, He wouldn’t have allowed such evil to come upon them. But they didn’t listen to His words; there were arguments among them, leading to bloodshed.
They even killed a prophet of the Lord, a chosen servant of God, who warned them of their sins and foretold many things to come, even the coming of Christ.
Because he told them that Christ is the God and Father of all, saying that He would take on human form, which was the same image in which man was created; in other words, he said that man was made to resemble God, and that God would come down among humans, taking on flesh and blood, walking the Earth—
Now, because of this message, they put him to death, and they did many other things that brought God’s wrath upon them. So, is it surprising they are in bondage and suffer great afflictions?
The Lord has said: I will not help my people when they sin; instead, I will block their paths so they cannot succeed; their actions will trip them up.
He also said: If my people choose wickedness, they will harvest destruction as a result; this destruction is poisonous.
He further declares: If my people choose to do wrong, they will face immediate devastation.
Now, it is clear that the Lord’s promise has come true, and you are suffering and in distress.
But if you turn back to the Lord with your whole heart, trust in Him, and serve Him diligently, He will, according to His will, rescue you from bondage.
