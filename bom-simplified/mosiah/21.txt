Limhi and his people returned to the city of Nephi, and they began to live peacefully in the land again.
After a while, the Lamanites became angry with the Nephites again and started to come into the borders of the land.
They didn’t dare to kill them because of the promise their king made to Limhi; instead, they hit them on the face, took control over them, piled heavy burdens on their backs, and drove them around like animals—
All of this happened to fulfill the word of the Lord.
The Nephites faced great suffering, with no way to escape the Lamanites, who had surrounded them completely.
The people started to complain to the king about their suffering, expressing a strong desire to fight back. They troubled the king with their complaints, so he allowed them to go to battle.
They gathered together, put on their armor, and marched against the Lamanites to reclaim their land.
However, the Lamanites defeated them, pushed them back, and killed many of them.
There was great sorrow among Limhi’s people, with widows mourning for their husbands, children grieving for their fathers, and brothers weeping for their siblings.
Many widows cried out daily, filled with fear of the Lamanites.
Their constant cries angered the remaining people of Limhi against the Lamanites, prompting them to battle again, but they were pushed back again, suffering heavy losses.
They went out to fight a third time and suffered similarly; those who survived returned to the city of Nephi.
They humbled themselves completely, submitting to bondage, allowing themselves to be mistreated and burdened as their enemies wished.
They showed deep humility and cried out to God for help all day long, asking Him to save them from their struggles.
The Lord was slow to respond to their pleas due to their wrongdoings; however, He did hear their cries and started to soften the hearts of the Lamanites so they eased some of the burdens, even though He didn’t free them from their captivity.
Gradually, they began to prosper again in the land, raising crops, livestock, and no longer going hungry.
There were many more women than men, so King Limhi commanded that every man should support the widows and their children to prevent them from starving; they complied, knowing how many had died.
The people of Limhi stayed together as much as possible, securing their grain and livestock.
The king did not trust himself outside the city walls without his guards, fearing he might fall into the hands of the Lamanites.
He ordered his people to watch the surrounding land to capture the priests that had escaped into the wilderness, who had taken the daughters of the Lamanites and caused great destruction.
They were eager to capture these priests for punishment because they had sneaked into Nephi at night and stolen their grain and valuables; they set a trap for them.
As it happened, there was no further conflict between the Lamanites and Limhi’s people until Ammon and his brothers arrived.
The king happened to be outside the city gates with his guards when he saw Ammon and his brothers, mistakenly thinking they were priests of Noah, and ordered them to be captured and imprisoned. If they had been those priests, he would have had them killed.
But when he realized they were his brothers from the land of Zarahemla, he was overwhelmingly happy.
Before Ammon arrived, King Limhi had sent a few men to look for Zarahemla, but they couldn’t find it and got lost in the wilderness.
Still, they discovered a land filled with dry bones, a land that had inhabitants in the past but was now deserted; thinking it was Zarahemla, they returned to Nephi shortly before Ammon arrived.
They brought back a record from the people whose bones they found, written on metal plates.
When Limhi learned from Ammon that King Mosiah could interpret such inscriptions, he was filled with joy; Ammon was also glad.
But Ammon and his brothers were sad because so many of their own people had died.
They mourned for the many sins King Noah and his priests had led the people to commit against God, for Abinadi’s death, and for the departure of Alma and his followers, who had formed a church through God’s power and faith in Abinadi's words.
They lamented for Alma’s group, as they didn’t know where they had gone. They would have gladly joined them because they had made a promise to God to serve Him and keep His commandments.
Since Ammon's arrival, King Limhi and many of his people had also promised God to serve Him and obey His commandments.
King Limhi and many of his people wanted to be baptized, but there was no one in the land with the authority from God to do so. Ammon felt unworthy to perform the baptism.
As a result, they did not form a church at that time, waiting for the Lord's guidance. They aspired to be like Alma and his brothers who had fled into the wilderness.
They wanted to be baptized as a sign of their commitment to serve God wholeheartedly; however, they delayed, and their baptismal account will be told later.
Now, all of their focus was on how to free themselves from the Lamanites and their bondage.
