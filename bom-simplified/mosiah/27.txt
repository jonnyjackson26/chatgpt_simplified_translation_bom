Mosiah prohibits persecution and promotes equality—Alma the Younger and the four sons of Mosiah aim to destroy the Church—An angel appears and commands them to stop their wicked ways—Alma is rendered speechless—Everyone must be reborn to achieve salvation—Alma and the sons of Mosiah share the joyful message. About 100–92 B.C.
At that time, the persecutions against the church by those who didn't believe became so severe that the church members began to grumble and bring their concerns to their leaders, specifically to Alma. Alma then took the issue to their king, Mosiah, who discussed it with his priests.
King Mosiah then announced across the land that no one could harass members of the church of God.
He made a strict rule in all the churches that there would be no persecution among them, ensuring equality for all individuals;
They were told to avoid pride and arrogance that might disrupt their peace, and to treat their neighbors as they would want to be treated, working with their own hands to support themselves.
Yes, all their priests and teachers were also to work with their own hands for their livings, except when they were sick or in extreme need; by doing these things, they experienced the grace of God.
Peace began to return to the land, and the population grew, spreading across the earth in all directions—north, south, east, and west, building large cities and villages everywhere.
The Lord accompanied them and blessed them, leading them to become a large and prosperous community.
However, the sons of Mosiah were among the unbelievers, and one of Alma's sons, also named Alma, was included; yet, he turned out to be very wicked and indulged in idol worship. He was a man of many words and spoke flattering things to the people, leading many to follow his sinful behavior.
He became a significant obstacle to the church's success—drawing people away and causing much conflict, giving the enemy of God a chance to gain power over them.
While he was secretly trying to destroy the church of God, associated with the sons of Mosiah in leading the Lord's people astray, against God's commandments and the king's wishes—
As I mentioned, while they were rebelling against God, the angel of the Lord appeared to them; it felt as if he descended from a cloud and spoke with a thunderous voice, which shook the ground they stood on;
So overwhelming was their shock that they fell to the ground, not understanding what he said to them.
Yet, he called out again, saying: Alma, get up and stand up, why are you persecuting the church of God? The Lord says: This is my church, and I will secure it; nothing will destroy it except the sins of my people.
Again, the angel said: Look, the Lord has heard the prayers of his people and also the prayers of His servant Alma, your father; he prayed sincerely for you to come to know the truth; this is why I have come to show you the power and authority of God, so that the prayers of His servants can be answered according to their faith.
Now, can you challenge the power of God? Look, doesn't my voice shake the earth? Can you not see me standing before you? I am sent from God.
Now I tell you: Go, and remember the captivity of your ancestors in the land of Helam and in the land of Nephi; remember the great things God did for them; they were enslaved, and He set them free. Now I say to you, Alma, go away and no longer seek to destroy the church, so that their prayers can be answered, even if it means you might be cast off yourself.
These were the last words the angel spoke to Alma before he left.
And then Alma and his companions fell to the ground again, for their surprise was immense; they had seen an angel of the Lord with their own eyes and heard a voice like thunder shaking the earth; they realized that only the power of God could create such a tremor.
Alma's astonishment was so profound that he lost the ability to speak and found himself too weak to move; his friends had to carry him until they placed him before his father.
They explained to his father everything that had happened, and he rejoiced, knowing it was the power of God.
He gathered a crowd so everyone could witness what the Lord had done for his son and those with him.
He had the priests come together, and they began to fast and pray to the Lord their God, asking Him to restore Alma's ability to speak and strengthen him, so that the people might see and know of God's goodness and glory.
After two days and nights of fasting and prayer, Alma's strength returned, and he stood up, encouraging them to be hopeful:
He said, I have repented of my sins and have been saved by the Lord; truly, I am born of the Spirit.
The Lord told me: Do not be surprised that all mankind, men and women, from every nation, lineage, language, and people, must be reborn; yes, reborn of God, changing from their sinful and fallen state to a state of righteousness, redeemed by God, becoming His sons and daughters;
Thus, they become new beings; and unless they do this, they cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
I tell you, if this does not happen, they will be cast off; and I know this because I nearly faced that fate.
Yet, after enduring much suffering and repenting almost to the point of death, the Lord in His mercy saved me from eternal torment, and I am reborn of God.
My soul has been freed from bitterness and the chains of sin. I was in the darkest pit; now I see the incredible light of God. My soul was filled with endless pain; now I am rescued, and I no longer suffer.
I turned against my Redeemer and denied the truths given by our ancestors; but now, those who await His coming know He remembers every creature He created, and He will make Himself known to all.
Yes, every knee will bow, and every tongue will confess before Him. Even on the last day, when all people stand to be judged by Him, they will acknowledge Him as God; and those who lived without God will admit that the judgment of endless punishment is just, trembling and quaking at His all-seeing gaze.
At this point, Alma began teaching the people, along with those who were with him when the angel appeared, traveling across the land, sharing the things they had seen and heard, and preaching the word of God amidst much trial, facing severe opposition from the unbelievers who beat them.
Despite all this, they provided great comfort to the church, strengthening their faith, and patiently encouraging them to keep the commandments of God.
Four of them were the sons of Mosiah; their names were Ammon, Aaron, Omner, and Himni—these were the sons of Mosiah.
They traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla and among all the people under King Mosiah, diligently working to mend the wrongs they had done to the church, admitting their sins, sharing everything they had experienced, and explaining the prophecies and scriptures to anyone who wanted to listen.
Thus, they served as instruments of God to bring many to know the truth, to know their Redeemer.
How blessed they are! For they brought peace, shared good news, and declared to the people that the Lord reigns.
