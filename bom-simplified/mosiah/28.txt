After the sons of Mosiah accomplished their tasks, they took a small group with them and went back to their father, the king. They asked him if he would allow them to go to the land of Nephi to share the teachings they had received and spread God's word to their brethren, the Lamanites.
They hoped to help the Lamanites come to know the Lord their God and persuade them to see the wrongdoings of their ancestors. They wanted to heal the Lamanites' hatred towards the Nephites and bring them joy in their relationship with God, fostering friendship and ending conflicts in the land that God had given them.
They were eager for salvation to be proclaimed to everyone since they couldn't stand the thought of anyone suffering eternally; even the idea of any soul facing endless torment made them feel anxious and fearful.
The Spirit of the Lord moved them, as they were once very wicked. Yet, in His boundless mercy, the Lord chose to spare them. Still, they experienced great pain because of their sins, suffering and fearing they might be cast away forever.
Eventually, they pleaded with their father for many days to let them go to the land of Nephi.
King Mosiah sought guidance from the Lord to find out if he should permit his sons to preach to the Lamanites.
The Lord told Mosiah to let them go, promising that many would believe their words and gain eternal life, assuring him that He would protect his sons from the Lamanites.
Mosiah then granted their request, allowing them to go and carry out their mission.
They set out into the wilderness to preach the word among the Lamanites, and I will recount their journey later.
King Mosiah had no one to pass the kingdom to, as none of his sons wanted the throne.
So, he took the records engraved on the brass plates, the plates of Nephi, and all the items he had preserved according to God’s commandments, including the records on the gold plates found by the people of Limhi, which were handed to him by Limhi.
He did this because his people were greatly eager to know about those who had been destroyed.
Continuing, he translated them using the two seer stones attached to the ends of a bow.
These stones were prepared from the start and passed down through generations for the purpose of translating languages.
They have been safeguarded by God so that everyone who possesses the land can be made aware of their people’s sins and unholy acts.
Anyone who has these stones is referred to as a seer, similar to ancient times.
After Mosiah completed the translation, it described the people who had been destroyed, from their demise back to the construction of the great tower, when God confused the language of the people and they were scattered across the earth, even tracing back to the creation of Adam.
This account caused Mosiah's people to grieve deeply; they were filled with sorrow, yet it also provided them much knowledge that brought them joy.
This account will be recorded later, as it is important for all people to be aware of what is documented in it.
As I mentioned, after King Mosiah completed these tasks, he entrusted the brass plates and everything he had kept to Alma, the son of Alma. He gave him all the records and the interpreters, instructing him to preserve them and maintain a record of the people, passing it down from generation to generation, just as it had been done since Lehi left Jerusalem.
