There was no fighting left in the land of Zarahemla among King Benjamin's people, and King Benjamin enjoyed peace for the rest of his life.
He had three sons and named them Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman. He ensured they learned the language of their ancestors so they could be wise and understand the prophecies spoken by their forefathers, which had been given to them by God.
He also taught them about the records engraved on the brass plates, saying: "My sons, remember that if these plates didn’t exist, which hold these records and commandments, we would remain in ignorance, even now, not knowing God’s mysteries."
It wouldn’t have been possible for our father, Lehi, to remember everything and teach us without these plates. Since he learned the Egyptian language, he could read what was written and pass it on to us and our children, fulfilling God’s commandments through generations up till now.
I tell you, my sons, if these preserved records weren’t available to us by the hand of God, so we could read and comprehend His mysteries and keep His commandments before us, even our ancestors would have fallen into disbelief, and we would be like our brothers, the Lamanites, who know nothing of these truths and doubt them due to incorrect traditions passed down.
Oh, my sons, I want you to know that what I've said is true, and the records are also true. And look at the plates of Nephi, which contain our fathers' records and teachings from when they left Jerusalem until now; they are trustworthy, and we know this because we have them in front of us.
Now, my sons, remember to study these records diligently, so you can gain wisdom from them; and keep God's commandments, so you may be blessed in the land as God promised our forefathers.
King Benjamin taught many more things to his sons that are not recorded in this book.
After teaching his sons, King Benjamin aged and realized he would soon pass away. So, he decided it was important to hand over the kingdom to one of his sons.
He called Mosiah before him and said: "My son, I want you to announce to all the people in the land of Zarahemla and the people of Mosiah who live here that they should gather together. Tomorrow I will publicly declare that you are a king and leader over the people that the Lord our God has given us."
Additionally, I will give this people a name so they stand out from all others that the Lord God has brought from Jerusalem. I do this because they have been faithful in keeping the Lord's commandments.
I will give them a name that will never be erased unless they turn away from God.
Yes, I tell you that if this favored people of the Lord turn away and become wicked, the Lord will let them become weak like their brethren; He will no longer protect them with His unmatched power as He has protected our ancestors.
I say this because if He had not saved our ancestors, they would have fallen to the Lamanites and suffered from their animosity.
After King Benjamin finished speaking to his son, he entrusted him with the kingdom's affairs.
He also placed him in charge of the records engraved on the brass plates, the plates of Nephi, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director that guided our ancestors through the wilderness, which the Lord prepared to lead them according to how closely they followed His guidance.
Therefore, when they were unfaithful, they did not succeed or advance in their journey. Instead, they were turned back and faced God's anger, resulting in famine and severe hardships to remind them of their responsibilities.
Now, Mosiah followed his father's command and announced to everyone in the land of Zarahemla to gather at the temple to hear the words his father would share with them.
