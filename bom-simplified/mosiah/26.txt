Many young people did not understand what King Benjamin had taught because they were too young when he spoke, and they did not believe the teachings of their ancestors.
They did not accept the messages about the resurrection or the future coming of Christ.
Their lack of belief prevented them from understanding God’s word, and their hearts became stubborn.
They refused to be baptized and would not join the church. They remained separate in their beliefs and continued to live sinful lives because they did not reach out to the Lord.
During the reign of King Mosiah, they were fewer than the faithful followers of God; however, because of conflicts among the church members, their number grew.
They deceived many church members with flattering words, leading them into various sins; thus, it became necessary for the church to warn those who sinned.
They were brought before the priests by the teachers, and the priests took them to Alma, the high priest.
King Mosiah had given Alma leadership over the church.
At that time, Alma was unaware of the specifics of their situation, but there were many witnesses against them; the people testified in great detail about their wrongdoings.
Such a situation had not occurred in the church before, causing Alma to feel troubled, and he decided to take the matter to the king.
Alma said to the king, "Look, we have brought many before you who have been accused by their fellow members. They have engaged in various sins and do not feel remorse; we present them to you for your judgment."
However, King Mosiah replied, "I will not judge them; I leave their judgment in your hands."
Alma's spirit was once again troubled, and he sought guidance from the Lord, fearing that he might act wrongly in God’s sight.
After pouring out his soul to God, he received a voice from the Lord saying:
"Blessed are you, Alma, and blessed are those who were baptized in the waters of Mormon. You are blessed because of your great faith in the words of my servant Abinadi.
And blessed are they for their strong belief in the teachings you have given them.
You are blessed because you have established a church among this people, and they will be my people.
Yes, blessed is this people who is willing to carry my name; they will be called by my name, and they belong to me.
And since you have asked about the wrongdoer, you are blessed.
You are my servant, and I promise you eternal life; you will serve me and go forth in my name, gathering my followers.
Anyone who hears my voice will be my follower; you will welcome them into the church, and I will also accept them.
This is my church; everyone who is baptized will do so as a sign of repentance. Those you receive into the church will believe in my name, and I will freely forgive them.
I take upon myself the sins of the world; I created the world, and I grant a place at my right hand to those who believe until the end.
They are called in my name, and if they know me, they will come forth and find a place eternally at my side.
When the second trumpet sounds, those who never knew me will come forth and stand before me.
Then they will realize I am the Lord their God, their Redeemer; however, they chose not to accept redemption.
I will tell them I never knew them, and they will depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
Therefore, I say to you, those who ignore my voice should not be accepted into my church, for I will not recognize them at the last day.
So, go; those who sin against me should be judged according to their wrongdoing, and if they confess their sins sincerely, you shall forgive them, and I will forgive them too.
Yes, I will forgive my people their trespasses whenever they truly repent.
You must also forgive one another for your faults; truly, if someone does not forgive their neighbor’s wrongs while claiming to repent, they bring condemnation upon themselves.
Now I say to you, go; those who refuse to repent of their sins will not be counted among my people from now on.
When Alma heard these words, he wrote them down to have the guidelines for judging the church members according to God's commandments.
Then Alma judged those accused of wrongdoing as instructed by the Lord.
Everyone who repented and confessed their sins was numbered among the church members;
But those who refused to confess and repent were not counted among the church members, and their names were removed from the rolls.
Alma managed all church affairs, leading to peace and prosperity among the church members, who walked carefully before God, welcoming and baptizing many.
All of these efforts were carried out by Alma and his fellow leaders, who were diligent in teaching God’s word, enduring many hardships, and facing persecution from those outside the faith.
They admonished their fellow members, who were also reminded of their sins by God's word, being commanded to pray without ceasing and to give thanks in all situations.
