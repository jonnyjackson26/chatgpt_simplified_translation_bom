After two years, Abinadi came to them disguised so they didn't recognize him. He began to speak, saying that the Lord had commanded him to tell the people He was angry with them because they had closed their hearts to His words and had not repented of their wrongdoings. As a result, God would come to punish them harshly for their sins and wickedness.
Truly, woe to this generation! The Lord told me to raise my hand and declare that because of their sins, this generation would become slaves and would be beaten, driven away by others, and killed, with their bodies being consumed by scavengers.
The life of King Noah will be valued nothing more than a piece of clothing tossed in a hot fire because he will realize that I am the Lord.
I will strike this people with severe hardship, including hunger and disease, and they will cry out in misery all day long.
Yes, I will put heavy burdens on them, and they will be treated like stubborn animals.
I will send hail upon them, which will harm them, and they will be struck by fierce winds; insects will torment their land and eat their crops.
They will suffer from serious disease—all of this will happen because of their sins and wicked actions.
And unless they repent, I will completely wipe them from the earth; however, they will leave behind records, which I will preserve for other nations that come to occupy the land; I will do this so that other nations can see the wickedness of this people. Abinadi prophesied many things against them.
Then, they became very angry with him. They captured him and brought him bound before the king, saying, "Look, we have brought a man who has predicted disaster for your people, claiming that God will destroy them."
"He also predicts disaster for your life, saying it will be like clothing in a furnace of fire."
"Again, he says you will be like a dried stalk in a field, trampled by animals."
"Moreover, he says you will be like thistle blossoms, which are easily blown away by the wind when they mature. He pretends that the Lord has spoken to him. He claims all this will happen to you unless you repent due to your sins."
"Now, King, what great evil have you done, or what serious sins have your people committed, that would cause us to be judged by God or condemned by this man?"
"King, we are innocent, and you, King, have not sinned; therefore, this man has falsely accused you, and his prophecies are meaningless."
"Look, we are strong; we will not be enslaved or captured by our enemies. You have prospered in the land, and you will continue to prosper."
"Here is the man; we hand him over to you; do whatever you think is best."
King Noah ordered that Abinadi be thrown into prison and called the priests together to decide what to do with him.
They asked the king to bring Abinadi to them so they could question him, and the king instructed that he be brought.
They started questioning him to catch him in a mistake, but he answered confidently and challenged all their questions, leaving them astonished because he astutely countered everything they asked.
Then one of them asked: "What do the words written by our forefathers mean, which say:
‘How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news on the mountains, who proclaim peace, who bring good news of happiness, who proclaim salvation, who declare to Zion, “Your God reigns!”’? 
‘Your watchmen will lift up their voices; together, they will sing for joy, for they will see eye to eye when the Lord brings back Zion. 
‘Shout for joy, O desolate places of Jerusalem, for the Lord has comforted His people, He has redeemed Jerusalem. 
‘The Lord has revealed His holy arm in the sight of all nations, and all ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God’?"
Then Abinadi replied, "You say you are priests and claim to teach this people and understand prophecy, yet you want me to explain what these words mean?"
"Woe to you for twisting the ways of the Lord! If you truly understood these things, you would have taught them properly. Instead, you have distorted the Lord's paths."
"You have not made an effort to understand; therefore, you are foolish. So, what are you teaching this people?"
They replied, "We teach the law of Moses."
Abinadi responded, "If you teach the law of Moses, why do you not practice it? Why do you focus on wealth? Why do you commit sexual sins and lead this people into sin, giving God reason to command me to prophesy against you, even with a severe warning?"
"Don't you realize I'm telling the truth? Yes, deep down, you know I am right; you should tremble before God."
"You will be punished for your sins, for you have claimed to teach the law of Moses. And what do you really know about the law of Moses? Does salvation come through the law of Moses? What do you say?"
They answered that salvation did indeed come through the law of Moses.
But Abinadi said, "I know that if you obey God's commandments, you will be saved; yes, if you keep the commandments that the Lord gave to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying:
'I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of slavery.
You shall have no other gods before Me.
You shall not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness of anything in heaven above, or on the earth below.'
Now, Abinadi asked them, "Have you done all of this? I tell you, no, you have not. Have you taught this people to do all these things? I say to you, no, you have not."
