A story about Alma and the people of God, who were forced to flee into the wilderness by the followers of King Noah.
This covers chapters and 24.
Alma decides not to be a king—He serves as high priest—God corrects His people, and the Lamanites take over the land of Helam—Amulon, leader of King Noah’s wicked priests, rules under the authority of the Lamanite king. This occurs around 145–121 B.C.
Alma, having been warned by the Lord that King Noah’s armies were coming for them, shared this with his people, so they gathered their livestock, collected their grain, and left for the wilderness before King Noah's armies could catch them.
The Lord gave them strength so that King Noah’s people couldn’t catch them to harm them.
They traveled for eight days into the wilderness.
They arrived at a beautiful and pleasant land, a place with pure water.
They set up their tents, started farming the land, and began to construct buildings; indeed, they worked hard and were very diligent.
The people wanted Alma to be their king because he was loved by them.
But he told them: Look, it’s not wise for us to have a king; for the Lord says: You shouldn’t value one person over another, nor should anyone think they are better than others; so I say to you, it’s not wise for you to have a king.
However, if it were possible to always have righteous people as your kings, it would be good for you to have a king.
But remember King Noah’s wrongdoing and the wickedness of his priests; I too was trapped and did many things that were repulsive to the Lord, which I greatly regret.
Yet, after enduring much hardship, the Lord heard my cries and answered my prayers, making me a tool in His hands to bring many of you to understand His truth.
Still, I do not take pride in this, for I am unworthy to boast about myself.
Now I say to you, you have suffered under King Noah and been enslaved by him and his priests, leading you into sin; thus, you were bound by wickedness.
And now, as you have been freed by God’s power from these bonds; yes, even from the hold of King Noah and his people, and also from the chains of sin, I hope you will stand firmly in the freedom you have received and not trust anyone to be a king over you.
Also, trust no one to be your teacher or minister unless he is a man of God, who walks in His ways and follows His commandments.
Alma taught his people to love their neighbors as themselves and to avoid fighting among themselves.
At this time, Alma was their high priest, being the founder of their church.
And it happened that no one was allowed to preach or teach unless they received authority from him from God. So he ordained all their priests and teachers; only just men were ordained.
Therefore, they watched over their people and nourished them with righteous teachings.
It came to pass that they began to flourish greatly in the land, which they named Helam.
They thrived and multiplied in the land of Helam; they built a city called the city of Helam.
Yet, the Lord thought it necessary to discipline His people; yes, He tests their patience and their faith.
Nevertheless, whoever puts their trust in Him will be uplifted in the end. Yes, that was the case for this people.
For I will show you that they were subjected to bondage, and only the Lord their God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob could save them.
And it came to pass that He did rescue them, and displayed His mighty power before them, and they rejoiced greatly.
For while they were in the land of Helam, yes, in the city of Helam, while they were working the land around them, an army of Lamanites appeared at the borders.
The brothers of Alma ran from their fields and gathered in the city of Helam, feeling very afraid when they saw the Lamanites.
But Alma went out and stood among them, encouraging them not to be afraid but to remember the Lord their God who would deliver them.
So they calmed their fears and began to cry out to the Lord asking Him to soften the hearts of the Lamanites so they would spare them, their wives, and their children.
And it happened that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites. Alma and his brothers went forth and surrendered themselves, and the Lamanites took control of the land of Helam.
Now the Lamanite armies, which had been pursuing King Limhi’s people, had gotten lost in the wilderness for many days.
And they found the priests of King Noah in a place they called Amulon; they began to occupy the land of Amulon and started farming there.
The leader of those priests was named Amulon.
And it came to pass that Amulon pleaded with the Lamanites; he also sent their wives, the daughters of the Lamanites, to beg them to spare their husbands.
The Lamanites felt compassion for Amulon and his brethren and did not destroy them because of their wives.
So, Amulon and his brothers joined the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness searching for the land of Nephi when they stumbled upon the land of Helam, which was occupied by Alma and his brethren.
Then, the Lamanites promised Alma and his brothers that if they showed them the way to the land of Nephi, they would grant them their lives and freedom.
But after Alma led them to the land of Nephi, the Lamanites did not keep their promise; instead, they set guards around the land of Helam, over Alma and his brothers.
The rest of them went to the land of Nephi; some returned to Helam and brought back the wives and children of the guards who had been left there.
And the king of the Lamanites allowed Amulon to be a king and leader over his people in the land of Helam; however, he could do nothing against the wishes of the Lamanite king.
