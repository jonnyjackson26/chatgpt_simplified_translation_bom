The king's army came back after searching for the Lord's people, but they found nothing.
The king's forces were small now, leading to divisions among the remaining people.
Some of them started expressing anger towards the king, which led to serious arguments among them.
There was a man named Gideon who was strong and opposed to the king, so he took out his sword and vowed in his anger to kill the king.
Gideon fought with the king, and when the king noticed he was losing, he fled to a tower close to the temple.
Gideon chased him and was about to climb the tower to kill the king, but the king looked around and saw that the Lamanites had entered their land.
In great distress, the king cried out, begging Gideon to spare him, saying the Lamanites were going to destroy them all.
The king was mainly worried about his own life rather than his people, but Gideon chose to spare him.
The king ordered everyone to flee from the Lamanites, leading them into the wilderness along with their women and children.
The Lamanites chased after them, caught up with them, and began to kill them.
Then the king commanded that all the men abandon their wives and children to escape the Lamanites.
Many men refused to leave their families and would rather stay and die with them. The others left their wives and children.
Those who stayed with their families asked their beautiful daughters to plead with the Lamanites for mercy.
The Lamanites felt sympathy for them, taken by the beauty of their women.
So the Lamanites spared their lives, took them captive, and brought them back to the land of Nephi, allowing them to keep their land if they handed over King Noah and half of all their possessions, including gold and silver, pledging to pay tribute every year to the Lamanite king.
One of the captured was a prince named Limhi, the son of the king.
Limhi didn't want his father to be killed, but he also knew of his father's wrongdoings and considered himself just.
Gideon secretly sent men into the wilderness to find the king and those with him. They met everyone except the king and his priests.
They had promised to return to Nephi, seeking revenge if their families were harmed, even if it meant their own deaths.
The king told them they shouldn't go back; they got angry with him and decided he should face a painful death by fire.
They also intended to kill the priests but they escaped deeper into the wilderness.
As they planned to return to Nephi, they encountered Gideon's men, who informed them of what had happened to their families and that the Lamanites had allowed them to keep their land by paying tribute.
The people told Gideon's men that they had killed the king, while his priests had fled even further away.
After finishing their ceremony, they returned to Nephi happily, relieved that their families were safe, and reported back to Gideon about the king's fate.
The king of the Lamanites made a promise to them that his people would not attack them.
Limhi, being the king's son, was named king by the people and pledged to the Lamanite king that his people would pay tribute, half of everything they owned.
Limhi then started to build up his kingdom and promote peace among his people.
The Lamanite king placed guards around the land to ensure Limhi's people stayed and did not escape into the wilderness, using the tribute to pay the guards.
King Limhi enjoyed peace in his kingdom for two years without any threats from the Lamanites.
