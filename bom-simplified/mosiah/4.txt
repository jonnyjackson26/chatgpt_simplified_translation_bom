King Benjamin continues his speech—Salvation comes through the Atonement—Trust in God to be saved—Keep your sins forgiven through faithfulness—Help those in need—Do everything wisely and in order.
After King Benjamin finished speaking the words given to him by the angel of the Lord, he looked around at the crowd, and noticed they had fallen to the ground in fear of the Lord.
They saw themselves in their true state, feeling lower than dust. They all cried out together: Please have mercy on us and use Christ’s atoning sacrifice so we can be forgiven for our sins and have our hearts cleansed; we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created everything in heaven and earth; he will come down to live among people.
After they said these things, the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, filling them with joy because they had received forgiveness for their sins and peace of mind due to their deep faith in Jesus Christ, who was to come, as King Benjamin had taught them.
Then King Benjamin spoke again, saying: My friends and family, I want you to pay attention so you can understand the rest of my message.
If understanding God's goodness has made you realize how insignificant you are and how fallen you are—
I say to you, if you have come to know God's goodness and unmatched power, wisdom, patience, and willingness to endure for the sake of humankind; and also, the atonement prepared since the beginning of time, so that salvation could come to those who trust in the Lord, keep his commandments diligently, and maintain their faith until the end of their lives—
I say that this is the person who will receive salvation through the atonement prepared for all people from the beginning, for everyone who ever lived since Adam's fall or who will live until the end of time.
This is how salvation comes. There is no other way to be saved except what I have shared with you, nor conditions for salvation aside from what I have taught you.
Believe in God; believe that he is real and that he created everything in heaven and earth; believe that he possesses all wisdom and power, both in heaven and on earth; believe that people cannot understand all that the Lord understands.
Also, believe that you must repent of your sins and abandon them, humble yourselves before God; sincerely ask him to forgive you; and now, if you believe these things, make sure you do them.
And again I say to you, just as I have before, that as you come to know God's glory, or if you have experienced his goodness and tasted his love, and received forgiveness for your sins, which brings immense joy to your souls, I want you to always remember the greatness of God, your own insignificance, and his goodness and patience towards you, who are unworthy, and humble yourselves deeply, praying to the Lord daily, and standing firm in faith about what is to come, which was promised by the angel.
And I say to you, if you do this, you will always be joyful and filled with God's love, retaining forgiveness for your sins; you will grow in the knowledge of the glory of the one who created you, and in what is just and true.
You will not want to harm each other but to live in peace and give each person what they deserve.
You will not let your children go hungry or without clothes; you will not allow them to break God's laws, fight among themselves, or serve the devil, who is sin’s master, and an enemy to all that is good.
Instead, you will teach them to live truthfully and respectfully; you will teach them to love and serve one another.
Also, you yourselves will help those who are in need; you will share what you have with those who need it; and you will not allow beggars to approach you in vain and leave to suffer.
You might think: That person has caused their own problems; so I won’t help them, I won’t provide for their needs, because their suffering is deserved—
But I say to you, whoever thinks this has great reason to repent; if they don’t, they will perish forever and have no claim to God’s kingdom.
For aren’t we all beggars? Don't we all rely on the same Being, God, for everything we have, for food, clothing, gold, silver, and all kinds of riches?
And even now, you have been calling on his name, asking for forgiveness for your sins. Has he let you ask in vain? No; he has poured his Spirit upon you, filled your hearts with joy, and left you speechless because of the overwhelming joy you feel.
Now, if God who created you, whom you depend on for your lives and all that you have, gives you what you ask for that is right, in faith, believing that you will receive it, then you should share what you have with one another.
If you judge the person asking for your help and condemn them, how much more severe will your own condemnation be for holding back what belongs to God—what does not belong to you but to God, to whom your life also belongs; and yet you do not ask for anything, nor repent for what you have done.
I say to you, woe to that person, for their possessions will perish with them; and these words I address to those who are wealthy in this world.
And again, I say to the poor, those who lack but have enough to get by from day to day; I mean all of you who refuse to help the beggar, because you say you have not; I would wish that you express in your hearts: I do not give because I do not have, but if I did, I would give.
If you think this in your hearts, you are guilt-free; otherwise, you are condemned, and your condemnation is fitting because you covet what you have not received.
Now, for the sake of what I have shared with you—so that you can keep receiving forgiveness for your sins every day, and live guiltlessly before God—I encourage you to give to the poor, everyone according to their means, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, and providing relief for them in both spiritual and temporal ways.
And make sure all of this is done wisely and in order; for it is not required that someone acts beyond their capacity. Additionally, they should be diligent to win the reward; therefore, everything should be done in an orderly manner.
And remember that anyone who borrows from their neighbor should return what they borrowed as agreed, or else they will sin, and possibly cause their neighbor to sin as well.
Finally, I cannot mention all the ways you might sin, as there are so many that I can't even count them.
But this much I can say: if you do not take care to watch your thoughts, words, and actions, and obey God's commandments, and continue in faith about what you have heard concerning the coming of our Lord until the end of your lives, you will perish. And now, remember, O man, and do not perish.
