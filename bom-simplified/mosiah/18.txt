Alma, who had escaped from King Noah's followers, felt deep remorse for his sins and started to move quietly among the people, sharing the teachings of Abinadi.
He spoke about future events, the resurrection of the dead, and how the people would be saved through Christ's suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven.
He taught everyone willing to listen, doing so secretly to avoid the king's attention, and many people believed in his message.
Those who believed him traveled to a place called Mormon, named by the king, which was on the edge of a wilderness that occasionally had wild animals.
In Mormon, there was a spring of clear water, and Alma would go there, hiding among some small trees during the day to avoid being found by the king's men.
Many people who believed Alma came to that place to hear him speak.
After many days, a large group gathered at the waters of Mormon to listen to Alma. Everyone who believed his words came together to hear him teach about repentance, redemption, and faith in the Lord.
He said to them: Look, here are the waters of Mormon (that’s how the place got its name). Now that you want to join God's community and be called His people, and are ready to help carry each other’s burdens to lighten the load;
You are also prepared to grieve with those who grieve, comfort those who need help, and stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all situations, and in any place, even to the point of death, so that you may be redeemed by God and counted among those who rise in the first resurrection, and receive everlasting life—
Now I ask you, if this truly reflects your wishes, what’s stopping you from being baptized in the Lord’s name, to affirm before Him that you’re making a covenant to serve Him and obey His commandments, so that He may bless you with His Spirit in abundance?
When the people heard this, they joyfully clapped their hands and said: This is what we desire.
Then Alma took Helam, who was one of the first to step forward, and they stood in the water. Alma cried out, asking the Lord to pour out His Spirit on him, so he could perform this work with a pure heart.
After saying this, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he proclaimed: Helam, I baptize you, having authority from Almighty God, as evidence that you have entered into a covenant to serve Him until your mortal body dies; may the Lord’s Spirit be given to you; and may He grant you eternal life through Christ, whom He prepared from the beginning of the world.
After Alma spoke these words, both he and Helam went under the water and then emerged joyfully, filled with the Spirit.
Then Alma took another person and baptized him as he had done the first time, but he didn’t immerse himself again.
He continued to baptize everyone else who came to the waters of Mormon, and there were about 204 souls who were baptized, receiving the grace of God.
From that moment on, they were known as the Church of God or the Church of Christ. It became apparent that everyone baptized with God’s authority was added to His church.
Alma, who had the authority from God, ordained priests—one for every fifty of the members—to preach and teach about the kingdom of God.
He instructed them to teach only the things he had taught and those spoken by the holy prophets.
He specifically told them to preach about repentance and faith in the Lord, who had redeemed His people.
He commanded them to avoid conflicts with one another and to have a shared focus, with one faith and baptism, keeping their hearts united in love for each other.
In this way, he directed their preaching. And so they became the children of God.
He also instructed them to keep the Sabbath day holy and to give thanks to the Lord every day.
Additionally, he commanded that the priests he ordained should work with their own hands to support themselves.
There was a designated day each week for them to gather for teaching and to worship the Lord, and as often as possible, to come together.
The priests were not to rely on the people for their livelihood; instead, they were to seek the grace of God through their work so that they could grow spiritually and have the knowledge to teach with divine authority.
Alma also instructed the church members to share their resources according to their means; if someone had a lot, they should give more; those with less should give only what they could, and those in need should receive help.
This sharing was done voluntarily and with good intentions toward God, and assistance was provided to the priests in need as well as to anyone who was poor or without clothing.
Alma said this to them because God had commanded it, and they lived righteously, helping each other both physically and spiritually according to their needs and desires.
All of this took place in Mormon, by the waters in the nearby forest; this place, the waters of Mormon, and the forest were beautiful to those who came to know their Redeemer there; they were indeed blessed, for they will sing His praises forever.
These actions were carried out away from the king’s awareness.
However, the king noticed some activity among the people and sent his servants to monitor them. So, on the day they gathered to hear the Lord’s word, they were found by the king’s men.
The king accused Alma of inciting the people to rebel against him, so he dispatched his army to destroy them.
When Alma and the followers of the Lord learned about the king’s army approaching, they quickly packed their tents and families and fled into the wilderness.
They numbered about 450 people.
