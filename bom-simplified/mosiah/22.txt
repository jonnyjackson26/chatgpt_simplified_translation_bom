Ammon and King Limhi began discussing with the people how to free themselves from captivity, so they gathered everyone together to hear their opinions on the situation.
They realized they had no way to escape from bondage except to take their women, children, flocks, herds, and tents, and flee into the wilderness; the Lamanites were too many, making it impossible for Limhi’s people to fight them with weapons.
Gideon then stepped forward and addressed the king, saying that he had often been listened to by the king during their conflicts with the Lamanites.
He continued, asking the king to consider his words one more time, expressing his desire to serve and help free the people from captivity.
The king allowed Gideon to speak, and Gideon told him:
Look at the back passage through the rear wall of the city. The Lamanites and their guards are drunk at night, so let’s send a message to gather our flocks and herds and drive them into the wilderness under cover of darkness.
I will follow your orders and deliver the final offering of wine to the Lamanites, and they will become intoxicated; then we can sneak through a hidden route past their camp while they're asleep.
This way, we can escape with our women, children, flocks, and herds into the wilderness and travel around the land of Shilom.
King Limhi listened to Gideon's plan.
King Limhi instructed his people to round up their flocks and sent the offering of wine to the Lamanites, along with extra wine as a gift; the Lamanites drank freely of what he provided.
That night, the people of King Limhi quietly left for the wilderness with their flocks and herds, journeying around the land of Shilom and heading towards Zarahemla, guided by Ammon and his brothers.
They took all their gold, silver, and valuable items they could carry, along with their supplies, as they continued their journey.
After many days in the wilderness, they reached the land of Zarahemla and united with the people of Mosiah, becoming his subjects.
Mosiah welcomed them joyfully and accepted their records, as well as the records the people of Limhi had discovered.
When the Lamanites realized that the people of Limhi had escaped during the night, they sent an army into the wilderness to track them down.
After two days of pursuit, they lost the trail and could no longer follow them, getting lost in the wilderness.
