There was a place in Shemlon where the Lamanite girls gathered to sing, dance, and have fun.
One day, a few of them came together to sing and dance.
The priests of King Noah were too ashamed to go back to the city of Nephi and feared that the people would kill them, so they couldn't return to their wives and children.
As they stayed in the wilderness, they spotted the Lamanite daughters and hid to watch them.
When only a few of them had gathered to dance, the priests came out of hiding, captured them, and took them into the wilderness; they carried away twenty-four daughters of the Lamanites.
When the Lamanites realized their daughters were missing, they were furious and blamed the people of Limhi.
As a result, they sent their armies; even the king led them as they went to the land of Nephi to destroy Limhi's people.
Limhi saw their preparations for war from a tower, so he gathered his people and waited for the Lamanites in the fields and forests.
When the Lamanites arrived, the people of Limhi attacked them from their hiding spots and began to kill them.
The battle became very fierce, as they fought bravely for their lives.
Despite being outnumbered, the people of Limhi drove the Lamanites back, fighting fiercely for their lives, wives, and children.
In the chaos, they found the Lamanite king among the dead; he was wounded but still alive, abandoned by his fleeing people.
They took him and tended to his wounds, bringing him before Limhi, saying: Here is the Lamanite king, injured and left for dead, and we have brought him to you; let us kill him.
But Limhi told them: Do not kill him, but bring him to me so I can see him. They brought him, and Limhi asked him: Why have you come to wage war against my people? My people have kept the promise I made to you; why have you broken the promise you made to us?
The king replied: I broke the promise because your people took my daughters; out of anger, I led my people to fight against you.
Limhi was unaware of this, so he said: I will investigate among my people and hold anyone responsible accountable. He ordered a search to find out who did it.
When Gideon, the king’s captain, heard this, he said to Limhi: Please do not search your people or blame them for this.
Do you not remember the priests of your father, whom your people tried to destroy? They are in the wilderness, and they are the ones who stole the Lamanite daughters.
Now, please inform the king of this, so he can tell his people to calm down; we are already facing a threat, and we are few in number.
They are coming with a large army, and unless the king makes peace with them, we will be doomed.
Are not the words of Abinadi being fulfilled against us because we ignored the Lord's words and continued in our wrongdoing?
Let us make peace with the king and fulfill our promise to him; it’s better to be in bondage than to lose our lives, so let’s stop the bloodshed.
Limhi then explained everything about his father and the priests who had run away, saying they were responsible for taking the daughters.
The king then calmed down and told his people: Let’s go meet them without weapons; I promise you, my people will not harm yours.
They followed the king and went to meet the Lamanites unarmed. When they met the Lamanites, the king bowed down and pleaded for Limhi's people.
Seeing the unarmed people of Limhi, the Lamanites felt compassion and were calmed down, returning with their king to their land in peace.
