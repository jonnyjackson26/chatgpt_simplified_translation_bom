When the king heard these words, he told his priests to get rid of this man and kill him, saying he was crazy and they had nothing to do with him.
They moved to grab Abinadi, but he stood firm and said to them:
"Do not touch me, because God will punish you if you do; I am here to deliver the message the Lord sent me, and I haven’t told you what you wanted me to say, so God will not allow me to be killed right now."
"I must fulfill the commandments God has given me, and because I’ve spoken the truth, you’re angry. You think I’m crazy because I’ve shared God’s word."
After Abinadi spoke, the people of king Noah did not dare to touch him, because the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and his face shone brightly, like Moses’ did when he spoke with the Lord on Mount Sinai.
He spoke powerfully and with authority from God, continuing his message:
"You see that you cannot kill me, so I will complete my message. I can tell my words are hurting you because I am revealing the truth about your wrongdoings."
"Yes, my words fill you with wonder, anger, and amazement."
"I will complete my message; after that, I don’t care where I go, as long as I am saved."
"But I want you to understand that what you do with me afterward will be a sign of greater things to come."
"Now I will read the rest of God’s commandments, because I see they are not in your hearts; you have spent most of your lives teaching wrongdoing."
"Remember, I told you: Do not make any carved images or likenesses of anything in heaven, on earth, or in the waters below."
"And do not bow down or serve them, because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the sins of the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me;"
"But I show mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments."
"Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God, because He will not consider anyone innocent who misuses His name."
"Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy."
"You shall work for six days and do all your tasks,"
"But on the seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord your God, you should not work—neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your servants, nor your animals, nor any foreigners living in your town;"
"Because in six days the Lord made the heavens, earth, sea, and everything in them; so He blessed the Sabbath and made it holy."
"Honor your father and mother so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you."
"Do not kill."
"Do not commit adultery. Do not steal."
"Do not give false testimony against your neighbor."
"Do not desire your neighbor's house, nor his wife, servants, ox, donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
After Abinadi finished saying these things, he asked them: "Have you taught this people to observe and follow these commandments?"
"I tell you, no; because if you had, the Lord wouldn’t have sent me to predict doom for this people."
"You claim that salvation comes through the law of Moses, but I tell you it's important to follow that law for now; however, a time will come when it won’t be necessary to follow it anymore."
"Furthermore, I say to you, salvation does not come from the law alone; if it weren’t for God's atonement for His people's sins, they would surely perish despite the law of Moses."
"I tell you that it was necessary for the Israelites to have a strict law because they were stubborn, quick to do wrong, and slow to remember the Lord their God;"
"Therefore, a strict law was given to them, a law of actions and rituals that they needed to follow each day to remind them of God and their responsibilities to Him."
"But I tell you that all these are symbols of what is yet to come."
"Now, did they truly understand the law? I say no, they did not, due to their hardened hearts; they did not understand that no one can be saved except through God’s redemption."
"Did not Moses prophesy about the coming of the Messiah and that God would redeem His people? Yes, and all the prophets since the beginning of the world have spoken about these things."
"Have they not said that God Himself would come down among men, take human form, and act with great power on the earth?"
"Yes, and have they not also said that He would bring about the resurrection of the dead, and that He would be oppressed and suffer?"
