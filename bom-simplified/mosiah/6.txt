After finishing his speech to the people, King Benjamin decided it was important to gather the names of everyone who had promised to keep God's commandments.
Except for little children, every single person had made that promise and chosen to follow the name of Christ.
Once King Benjamin completed these tasks, he dedicated his son Mosiah to lead the people as king. He gave Mosiah clear instructions about the kingdom and assigned priests to teach the people. This was so they could learn God's commandments and remember the promises they had made. After that, he sent the crowd home to their families.
Mosiah started to rule in place of his father. He began his reign at thirty years old, making it a total of about four hundred seventy-six years since Lehi left Jerusalem.
King Benjamin lived for three more years before he passed away.
During his reign, King Mosiah followed the ways of the Lord, obeyed His laws and commands, and kept all the instructions given to him.
King Mosiah encouraged his people to farm the land. He also worked the land himself so that he wouldnâ€™t be a burden on them, following the example set by his father. For three years, there was no fighting among his people.
