The Record of Zeniff—This recounts the story of his people, starting from the time they left Zarahemla until they were rescued from the Lamanites.
It includes chapters through 22.
I, Zeniff, learned the language of the Nephites and knew about Nephi, the land of our ancestors' first inheritance. I was sent as a spy among the Lamanites to gather intelligence on their forces so our army could attack and defeat them. However, when I saw what was good among them, I wanted to save them from destruction.
As a result, I argued with my fellow soldiers in the wilderness, wanting our leader to make peace with them. But he was harsh and bloodthirsty and ordered my death. I was saved only after much violence erupted, as fathers fought against each other and brothers turned against brothers, leading to the death of many in our army. Those of us who survived returned to Zarahemla to tell our families what had happened.
Despite this, I was eager to reclaim our ancestral land, so I gathered those who wanted to go with me and set out again into the wilderness. Unfortunately, we suffered from hunger and severe hardships because we were slow to remember the Lord our God.
Nevertheless, after wandering for many days, we set up our tents at the location where our brethren had been killed, close to our ancestral land.
I then went back into the city with four men to meet with the king, wanting to know his intentions and whether we could peacefully settle the land.
I approached the king, and he agreed to let us have the land of Lehi-Nephi and Shilom.
He also ordered his people to leave the land, and my people moved in to take possession of it.
We started constructing buildings and repairing the city walls of both Lehi-Nephi and Shilom.
We began to farm the land, planting all kinds of seeds—corn, wheat, barley, and various fruits—and we started to grow and prosper.
King Laman secretly planned to enslave my people, which is why he allowed us to take over the land.
After we settled for twelve years, King Laman became worried that my people might become strong and unshackled, making it difficult for him to control us.
His people were lazy and idol-worshippers, wanting to enslave us so they could enjoy the fruits of our labor and the bounty of our livestock.
Consequently, King Laman incited his people against us, leading to wars and conflicts in the land.
In the thirteenth year of my reign in Nephi, while my people were tending to their flocks and farming, a large group of Lamanites attacked them, killing many and stealing their livestock and crops.
Those who escaped ran to the city of Nephi and called on me for help.
I armed them with bows, arrows, swords, and other weapons we could create, and then I led my people into battle against the Lamanites.
By the strength of the Lord, we went into battle; we cried out to the Lord to save us from our enemies, reminding ourselves of the deliverance of our forefathers.
God heard our cries and answered our prayers; we went forth with His strength and were able to defeat the Lamanites, killing three thousand and forty-three of them in a single day and night until we drove them from our land.
I personally helped bury our dead, and sadly, two hundred and seventy-nine of our own people had been killed.
