Mosiah decided to ask all the people what they wanted regarding their king.
The people responded, saying they wanted Aaron, Mosiah's son, to be their king and leader.
However, Aaron was away in the land of Nephi, so Mosiah couldn’t make him king, and Aaron didn’t want to be king. None of Mosiah's other sons were willing to take the throne either.
So, King Mosiah sent out another message to the people, and this is what he wrote:
Listen, my people, I care for you and want you to think carefully about the choice you’re making, because you want a king.
I need to tell you that the rightful heir to the throne has turned away and does not want to be king.
If someone else is appointed in his place, I worry that it could lead to arguments among you. Who knows, my son, who rightfully should be king, might get angry and take some of you with him, leading to wars and causing much bloodshed, which would go against the ways of the Lord and harm many souls.
So, let’s be smart and think about this because we cannot destroy my son, nor should we harm anyone else if someone new is chosen.
If my son goes back to his prideful ways, he may want the kingdom again, causing sin for both him and the people.
Let’s look ahead wisely and do what brings peace to everyone.
So, I will stay your king for the rest of my life; however, let’s choose judges to govern fairly based on our laws, and we’ll set up how to manage our affairs, appointing wise judges who will follow God’s commandments.
It’s better for God to judge a person than for people to judge them, because God’s judgments are always fair, while human judgments can be flawed.
If you could have honest men as your kings who would uphold God’s laws and judge righteously, like my father Benjamin did, then it would be wise to have kings.
I have worked hard to teach you God’s commandments and to promote peace in our community, so there are no wars, stealing, plundering, or murder.
I have punished those who committed crimes following the laws given to us by our ancestors.
Since not everyone is just, it's not wise to have kings ruling over you.
Look at how much evil a wicked king can create and the destruction it causes!
Remember King Noah and the terrible things he did, and how his people also behaved; great destruction came upon them because of their wrongdoings, leading them into bondage.
If it weren’t for their wise Creator stepping in because they truly repented, they would still be suffering in bondage today.
But He delivered them because they humbled themselves and cried out to Him for help; this is how the Lord shows His mercy to those who trust Him.
It’s important to know that you can’t remove a wicked king without a lot of fighting and bloodshed.
He has his supporters who engage in wrongdoing, and he surrounds himself with guards, tearing down the good laws from previous righteous rulers while ignoring God’s commandments.
He makes his own unjust laws, which he forces his people to obey, threatening destruction for those who don’t follow him, causing war against those who rebel, and leading righteousness astray.
So, I say it’s not wise to allow such evil to happen among you.
Therefore, choose judges by the voice of the people, so that you can be judged based on the good laws passed down from our ancestors.
It’s rare for the majority to want something wrong; usually, it's a small group that wants what’s not right. So, let the people's voice guide you in decision-making.
If the people choose wrongdoing, then God’s judgment will fall upon you, bringing serious destruction just like it has done in the past.
If you have judges who don’t judge fairly according to the law, you can appeal to a higher judge.
If those higher judges are also unjust, gather a few lower judges to evaluate the higher ones based on what the people want.
I urge you to follow these instructions respectfully and remember to have no king, so if any wrongs are done, only the individuals who committed them will be held responsible.
The sins of the people have often stemmed from their kings, and so those kings are responsible for the wrongdoings.
I want this injustice to end in our land, especially among my people; I desire that we live in freedom where everyone enjoys equal rights, as long as the Lord allows us to stay here.
King Mosiah wrote many more things to them, sharing the struggles a righteous king faces and all the complaints people express to their leaders, explaining that these issues should not exist; instead, everyone should share in the burden.
He also highlighted the problems caused by having an unrighteous ruler; the wrongdoing, arguments, wars, murders, thefts, sexual immorality, and all forms of wickedness—which don't align with God’s commandments.
After Mosiah sent his message, the people recognized the truth in his words.
Consequently, they gave up their wish for a king and became eager for each person to have an equal opportunity; everyone agreed to take responsibility for their own actions.
Then they gathered across the land to vote on who their judges should be, to govern according to the laws given to them, and they were very happy about the freedom they were granted.
They grew to love Mosiah deeply, respecting him more than anyone else, not seeing him as a greedy tyrant but as someone who brought peace and freedom instead of seeking wealth or delighting in violence; he had ensured that his people were freed from all forms of bondage, and as a result, they held him in very high regard.
They then appointed judges to rule over them according to the law, and they did this throughout the entire region.
Alma was chosen as the first chief judge and high priest, given this responsibility by his father, who entrusted him with the church's matters.
Following this, Alma lived righteously, followed God's commandments, and made fair judgments; peace reigned throughout the land.
Thus began the era of judges in Zarahemla amongst the Nephites, with Alma serving as the first chief judge.
Eventually, Alma's father passed away at the age of eighty-two after fulfilling God’s commandments.
Mosiah also died after ruling for thirty-three years, at the age of sixty-three; this marked a total of five hundred and nine years since Lehi left Jerusalem.
This ended the kings' rule over the Nephite people and closed the chapter on Alma’s life, who was the founder of their church.
