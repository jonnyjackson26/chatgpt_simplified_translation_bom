And once again, my friends, I want to redirect your focus because I have more to share with you; pay attention, as I have important messages about what is yet to come.
These messages have been revealed to me by a heavenly messenger from God. He instructed me to wake up, and when I did, I saw him standing right in front of me.
He said to me: Wake up and listen to the words I’m about to share; I’m here to bring you remarkable news that will bring great happiness.
God has heard your prayers and acknowledged your righteousness. He has sent me to share this news with you so that you may rejoice and share this joy with your people too.
For the time is approaching, and it will soon come, when the Lord Almighty, who has always existed and will always exist, will come down from heaven and live among humans in a physical body. He will perform great miracles, like healing the sick, raising the dead, helping the lame to walk, giving sight to the blind, enabling the deaf to hear, and curing all kinds of illnesses.
He will expel evil spirits that live in the hearts of people.
And truly, he will endure temptations and suffer physical pain, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion, even more than any human can bear, except in death; for his sorrow will be so immense that blood will ooze from every pore because of the wickedness and sins of his people.
He will be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Creator of all things, and his mother will be named Mary.
He will come to his own people so that salvation can be granted to humanity through faith in his name; yet, despite all this, people will see him merely as a man, accuse him of being possessed, whip him, and crucify him.
He will rise again on the third day; and he will stand to judge the world, ensuring that all these events happen so that a fair judgment can be made upon mankind.
For indeed, his blood will atone for the sins of people who have died without knowing God's will, or who have sinned out of ignorance.
But cursed is the one who knowingly rebels against God! For such people can only find salvation through repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
The Lord has sent his holy prophets to all people, to share these truths with every race and language so that whoever believes in the coming of Christ may be forgiven of their sins and find immense joy, as if he had already come to them.
Yet, God saw that his people were stubborn, so he gave them a law, specifically the law of Moses.
He showed them many signs and wonders, as well as types and symbols that pointed to his coming; holy prophets spoke about his coming too. Despite this, they hardened their hearts and failed to understand that the law of Moses means nothing without the atonement of his blood.
Even if it were possible for young children to commit sins, they could not be saved; but I assure you, they are blessed; because though they fall as all do by nature, the blood of Christ covers their sins.
Moreover, I say that there is no other name, way, or means through which salvation can come to humanity, except in and through the name of Christ, the Almighty.
For behold, he judges fairly; an infant who dies in their infancy will not perish; but those who bring harm upon their souls do so unless they humble themselves, become like little children, and believe that salvation has always been, is now, and will always be available through the atoning blood of Christ, the Almighty.
The natural man is an enemy to God, and has been since Adam’s fall, and will remain so forever unless he listens to the Holy Spirit, sheds his natural tendencies, and becomes a saint through Christ's atonement, becoming like a child—submissive, gentle, humble, patient, loving, and willing to endure whatever the Lord decides to impose on him, just as a child obeys his father.
Furthermore, I tell you that a time will come when the knowledge of a Savior will spread to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
And when that time comes, no one will be found innocent before God except for little children; only through repentance and faith in the name of the Almighty God.
Even now, after you have taught your people what the Lord your God has commanded you, they will still not be found blameless before God, only according to the messages I have shared with you.
Now I have delivered the words that the Lord God commanded me to speak.
And thus the Lord declares: These words will serve as a bright testimony against this people on judgment day, when each person will be judged according to their actions, whether good or bad.
If their actions are evil, they will experience a dreadful realization of their guilt and sins, causing them to flee from the Lord’s presence into a state of perpetual misery and torment, from which there is no return; thus, they will have condemned their own souls.
Therefore, they will have drunk from the cup of God’s wrath, which justice could not refuse them, just as it could not prevent Adam from falling due to his choice to eat the forbidden fruit; thus, mercy will forever have no claim on them.
Their torment will be like a lake of fire and sulfur, whose flames cannot be extinguished, and whose smoke will rise forever and ever. This is what the Lord commanded me to share. Amen.
