Fourth Nephi
The Book of Nephi Who Is the Son of Nephi—One of the Disciples of Jesus Christ
A description of the people of Nephi, according to his record.
The Nephites and Lamanites turned to the Lord—They shared everything, performed miracles, and thrived in the land—After two centuries, divisions, evil, false churches, and persecution began—After three hundred years, both groups became wicked—Ammaron hid the sacred records. About A.D. 35–321.
After thirty-four years had passed, and then thirty-five, the disciples of Jesus established a church of Christ in all surrounding lands. All who came to them and truly repented were baptized in Jesus' name and received the Holy Ghost.
In thirty-six, everyone became converted to the Lord across the entire land, both Nephites and Lamanites; there were no conflicts among them, and everyone treated each other fairly.
They shared everything equally; thus, there were no rich or poor, slaves or free—their freedom was complete, and they all enjoyed heavenly blessings together.
Then thirty-seven years passed, and peace remained in the land.
The disciples of Jesus performed many remarkable miracles: they healed the sick, raised the dead, helped the lame walk, gave sight to the blind, and made the deaf hear; every miracle was done in Jesus' name.
The years continued, with thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty-one, and forty-two passing by, right up to fifty-nine years.
The Lord prospered them greatly in the land; they rebuilt cities that had been destroyed by fire.
They even rebuilt the great city of Zarahemla.
However, many cities had sunk beneath the water, so they could not be restored.
And behold, the people of Nephi grew stronger and multiplied very quickly, becoming a beautiful and delightful people.
They married and were given in marriage, and they were blessed according to the numerous promises the Lord had made to them.
They no longer followed the law of Moses but adhered to the commandments given to them by their Lord and God, continuing to fast and pray, gathering often to pray and listen to the word of the Lord.
There was no conflict among the people; many great miracles were performed by the disciples of Jesus.
As the seventy-first year passed, then the seventy-second and eventually up to seventy-nine years, a hundred years had gone by, and all the chosen disciples of Jesus had departed for paradise, except for three who remained; other disciples were appointed in their place, and many from that generation had also passed away.
There was no contention in the land due to God's love residing in the hearts of the people.
There were no envies, conflicts, riots, immoral acts, lies, murders, or any kind of wickedness; surely, no happier people existed among all of God's creation.
There were no robbers or murderers, nor were there Lamanites or any divisions; they were united as the children of Christ, heirs to God's kingdom.
They were truly blessed! The Lord blessed their efforts, and they thrived until an additional hundred ten years had gone by; the first generation from the time of Christ had all passed, and there was peace throughout the land.
Nephi, who kept this final record on the plates of Nephi, died, and his son Amos took over the record, also on the plates of Nephi.
He maintained it for eighty-four years, during which peace endured, except for a small group of people who had revolted from the church and called themselves Lamanites; thus, Lamanites reappeared in the land.
Eventually, Amos died too, and it was one hundred ninety-four years after Christ came; his son Amos continued the record, again on the plates of Nephi, and it was also written in the book of Nephi, which is this book.
After two hundred years had passed, only a few from the second generation remained.
Now I, Mormon, want you to know that the people multiplied to the point where they spread across the land and became very wealthy due to their prosperity in Christ.
In this two hundred first year, pride began to arise among them, manifesting in the form of expensive clothing, fancy pearls, and luxurious possessions.
From that time onward, their possessions were no longer shared.
They started to divide into classes and began establishing churches for profit, denying the true church of Christ.
When two hundred ten years passed, numerous churches emerged in the land; many claimed to know Christ yet rejected key parts of his gospel, allowing all kinds of wickedness and offering sacred things to those unworthy.
One church grew significantly due to their iniquity and the influence of Satan over their hearts.
Another church emerged that rejected Christ and persecuted the true church because of its humility and faith; they despised those believers due to the many miracles seen among them.
Therefore, they exerted power and authority over the disciples of Jesus who stayed with them, throwing them into prison; but through the power of God's word in them, the prisons were miraculously opened, and they performed mighty miracles among the people.
Despite all these miracles, the people grew hard-hearted, seeking to kill them, just as the Jews in Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus.
They threw them into fiery furnaces, but they emerged unharmed.
They also cast them into dens of wild animals, but they played with the beasts like children with a lamb; and again, they came out unscathed.
Still, the people’s hearts hardened, led by many false priests and prophets to create many churches and commit many wrongs. They struck the people of Jesus, but the followers of Jesus did not retaliate. Thus, they fell into unbelief and wickedness year after year, until two hundred thirty years had passed.
In the year two hundred thirty-one, a significant division arose among the people.
This year marked the rise of a group known as Nephites, who were true believers in Christ; among them were those labeled by the Lamanites as Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites.
Thus, the authentic followers of Christ, including the three disciples meant to remain, were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites.
Those who rejected the gospel were referred to as Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; they did not simply dwindle in disbelief but actively opposed the gospel of Christ, teaching their children not to believe, just as their forefathers had.
Their rejection stemmed from the sins and abominations of their ancestors, just as it had from the outset. They were taught to hate God’s children, exactly as the Lamanites had been taught to hate the Nephites.
Two hundred forty-four years went by, and such were the conditions of the people. The wicked faction grew stronger, becoming much more numerous than the people of God.
They continued to establish churches for themselves, adorning them with countless valuables. Thus two hundred fifty years passed, then two hundred sixty.
The wicked segment of the population rekindled the secret oaths and secret combinations of Gadianton.
Likewise, the people called Nephites became proud due to their great wealth, adopting vanity similar to that of the Lamanites.
From this moment, the disciples began to mourn for the world’s sins.
After three hundred years had passed, both Nephites and Lamanites became exceedingly wicked, much like each other.
The Gadianton robbers infiltrated the entire land, with hardly anyone righteous aside from the disciples of Jesus. They hoarded gold and silver and engaged in all sorts of trade.
After three hundred five years, the people remained in wickedness; Amos died, and his brother Ammaron took over the record.
When three hundred twenty years had passed, Ammaron, influenced by the Holy Ghost, hid away the sacred records—indeed, all the sacred records handed down through generations—up to the three hundred twentieth year since Christ's arrival.
He hid them for the Lord, so that they might return to the remnant of Jacob’s house, in accordance with the Lord's prophecies and promises. Thus ends the record of Ammaron.
