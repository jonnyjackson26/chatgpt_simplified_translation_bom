They began to worship the Lord and went with me; we worked on the wooden parts of the ship with intricate designs. The Lord occasionally guided me on how to construct the ship's timbers.
I, Nephi, did not use the methods of men to build the ship; instead, I followed the instructions the Lord gave me, so it was not built like a typical vessel.
I often went up the mountain to pray to the Lord, and during those times, He revealed great things to me.
Once I completed the ship as the Lord had instructed, my brothers saw that it was good and that the craftsmanship was exceptional; they humbled themselves before the Lord once more.
Then, the Lord spoke to my father, telling us to get up and board the ship.
The next day, after we prepared everything, which included plenty of fruit, meat from the wilderness, and an abundance of honey along with other provisions as the Lord commanded, we descended into the ship with all our supplies, seeds, and everything we brought, each according to their age. Thus, we all boarded the ship, including our wives and children.
My father had two sons while in the wilderness; the older was named Jacob, and the younger, Joseph.
After we all boarded the ship and took our provisions as commanded, we set sail into the sea and were carried along by the wind towards the promised land.
After days of being driven by the wind, my brothers and the sons of Ishmael, along with their wives, began to celebrate, dancing, singing, and behaving rudely. They even forgot the power that had brought them to this place and became extremely disrespectful.
I, Nephi, became very worried that the Lord would be angry with us for our wrongdoings and that we might be drowned in the sea. So, I spoke to them seriously, but they became angry with me, rejecting the idea of me being their leader.
Eventually, Laman and Lemuel took me and bound me with ropes, treating me very harshly; however, the Lord allowed this to demonstrate His power and fulfill His words about the wicked.
After I was restrained so that I couldn't move, the compass given by the Lord stopped working.
As a result, they didn’t know where to steer the ship, and a terrible storm arose, pushing us back on the waters for three days. They grew exceedingly afraid that they would drown, yet they didn't free me.
On the fourth day, as we continued to be driven back, the storm became more intense.
We were on the verge of being consumed by the depths of the ocean. After four days of being blown away, my brothers realized that God's judgments were upon them and that they would perish unless they repented of their wrongdoings. They came to me and untied the ropes on my wrists, which were greatly swollen, and my ankles were also very swollen and painful.
Still, I looked to my God and praised Him all day; I did not complain about my suffering.
My father Lehi told many things to them and the sons of Ishmael; however, they threatened anyone who tried to speak for me. My parents, aged and already suffering much sorrow because of their children, were very weak and close to death.
Due to their grief over my brothers' sins, they seemed near death, their grey hairs poised to descend to the dust, and they were close to being lost at sea filled with sorrow.
Jacob and Joseph, being young and needing much care, were upset over their mother’s suffering; my wife also cried and prayed, but none of this softened my brothers' hearts to free me.
Nothing could soften their hearts except the power of God, which threatened them with destruction. When they saw the storm was about to drown us, they finally repented and untied me.
After they released me, I took the compass, and it worked as I desired. I then prayed to the Lord; after my prayer, the winds and storm stopped, and there was a great calm.
I, Nephi, then guided the ship, and we sailed again towards the promised land.
After sailing for many days, we finally reached the promised land; we disembarked and set up our tents, naming the land the promised land.
We began to cultivate the land and plant seeds as we had brought from Jerusalem. The seeds grew very well, and we were blessed with abundance.
During our journey in the wilderness within the promised land, we discovered various animals in the forests, including cows, oxen, donkeys, horses, goats, and other wild creatures useful for men. We also found different types of minerals, including gold, silver, and copper.
