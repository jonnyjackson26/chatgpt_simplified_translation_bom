An account of Lehi and his wife Sariah, along with their four sons, starting from the oldest: Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to leave Jerusalem because he is prophesying about the people's wickedness, and they want to kill him. He travels into the wilderness with his family for three days. Nephi takes his brothers back to Jerusalem to get the record of the Jews. Their experiences and hardships are detailed. They marry the daughters of Ishmael. They take their families and go into the wilderness. They face suffering and challenges during their travels. They reach the ocean. Nephi's brothers turn against him. He confronts them, and builds a ship. They name the place Bountiful. They cross the ocean to the promised land, and so on. This record is from Nephi; in other words, I, Nephi, wrote this.
Nephi starts the story of his people—Lehi sees a vision of a pillar of fire and reads from a book of prophecy—He praises God, predicts the coming of the Messiah, and foresees Jerusalem's destruction—He faces persecution from the Jews. Around 600 B.C.
I, Nephi, was born to good parents, so I learned a lot from my father, and even though I faced many troubles in my life, I was still greatly blessed by the Lord; I have a deep understanding of God’s goodness and mysteries, and that’s why I am keeping a record of my experiences.
Yes, I am writing in my father’s language, which includes Jewish learning and Egyptian language.
I know my record is true; I am writing it by my own hand and based on what I know.
In the first year of King Zedekiah's reign in Judah (my father, Lehi, had lived in Jerusalem all his life), many prophets came that year, warning the people to repent or Jerusalem would be destroyed.
So, my father, Lehi, went out and prayed earnestly for his people.
As he prayed, a pillar of fire appeared on a rock before him, and he saw and heard many things that made him tremble with fear.
He returned home to Jerusalem and fell onto his bed, overwhelmed by the Spirit and the things he had witnessed.
Overcome by the Spirit, he was shown a vision where he saw the heavens opened and thought he saw God on His throne, surrounded by countless angels singing and praising Him.
Then he saw One coming down from heaven whose brightness was greater than the midday sun.
He also saw twelve others following Him, and they were brighter than the stars in the sky.
They came down to earth, and the first one approached my father and gave him a book, instructing him to read it.
As he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord.
He read: "Woe to Jerusalem, for I have witnessed your abominations! Indeed, my father read many things about Jerusalem—how it would be destroyed and many people would die by the sword or be taken captive to Babylon.
After reading these extraordinary things, my father cried out to the Lord, saying: "Great and marvelous are your works, O Lord God Almighty! Your throne is lofty in the heavens, and your power, goodness, and mercy extend to all people on earth; because you are merciful, you will not let those who come to you perish!"
This was how my father expressed his praise to God, for he was filled with joy and his heart was full because of what the Lord had shown him.
Now, I, Nephi, won’t cover everything my father wrote, as he recorded many visions and dreams, as well as prophecies and messages to his children, which I won't go into in detail.
But I will focus on my own experiences. I am summarizing my father's record on plates I made with my own hands; after summarizing his record, I will write about my own life.
Therefore, I want you to know that after the Lord revealed many wonderful things to my father, Lehi, about the destruction of Jerusalem, he began to go among the people, prophesying and declaring what he had seen and heard.
The Jews mocked him for his testimonies; he truly spoke about their evil and wickedness; he testified that what he saw and read in the book clearly pointed to the coming of the Messiah and the redemption of the world.
When the Jews heard these things, they became angry with him, just as they had been with the prophets of the past, whom they had rejected, stoned, and killed; they sought to take his life. But I, Nephi, will show you that the Lord's tender mercies are upon all whom He has chosen, due to their faith, giving them the strength for deliverance.
