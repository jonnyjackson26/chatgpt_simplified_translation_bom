**The First Book of Nephi**
**His Reign and Ministry**
This is a story about Lehi and his wife Sariah, and their four sons, starting with the oldest: Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. The Lord warns Lehi to leave Jerusalem because he is prophesying about the people's wickedness, and they want to kill him. He journeys for three days into the wilderness with his family. Nephi takes his brothers back to Jerusalem to retrieve the records of the Jews. This is the story of their hardships. They marry the daughters of Ishmael. They take their families and set out into the wilderness. They endure suffering and challenges during the journey. They travel on their way and reach the sea. Nephi's brothers rebel against him. He proves them wrong and builds a ship. They name the place Bountiful. They cross the sea to the promised land, and so on. This is Nephi’s account; or, in other words, I, Nephi, wrote this record.
Nephi begins to tell his people’s story—Lehi sees a vision of a pillar of fire and reads from a prophetic book—He glorifies God, predicts the coming of the Messiah, and foretells Jerusalem's destruction—He faces persecution from the Jews. About 600 B.C.
I, Nephi, was born to good parents, so I learned a bit about all my father's teachings; and even though I've faced many difficulties in my life, I have been greatly blessed by the Lord throughout my days. I have gained deep knowledge about God’s goodness and mysteries, which is why I am writing this record of my experiences.
I am writing in my father’s language, which includes both the Jewish learning and the Egyptian language.
I know my record is true; I write it with my own hand, based on what I know.
It was in the first year of Zedekiah’s reign as king of Judah (my father, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem his whole life); during that same year, many prophets came to the city, telling the people to repent or risk the destruction of Jerusalem.
So my father, Lehi, went out and prayed earnestly to the Lord for his people.
As he prayed, a pillar of fire appeared on a rock in front of him; he saw and heard many things and trembled greatly because of what he experienced.
He returned home to Jerusalem, fell onto his bed overwhelmed by the Spirit and everything he had witnessed.
While in this state, he had a vision and saw the heavens open, thinking he saw God sitting on His throne surrounded by countless angels singing praises.
He then saw One coming down from heaven, whose brightness was greater than the sun at noon.
He also saw twelve others with Him, shining even brighter than the stars in the sky.
They came down and walked on the earth; the first one approached my father and handed him a book, telling him to read it.
As he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord. 
He read words of warning about Jerusalem, saying: “Woe to you, Jerusalem, for I have seen your wrongdoings!” My father saw many things about Jerusalem—that it would be destroyed, and its people would suffer greatly, some dying by the sword and others taken captive to Babylon.
After reading and witnessing many marvelous events, my father praised the Lord with exclamations such as: “Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty! Your throne is high in the heavens, and Your power, goodness, and mercy extend over all the earth; because You are merciful, You will not let those who turn to You perish!”
This is how my father spoke in praise of his God; his soul was joyful, and his heart was full because of what he had seen and what the Lord had shown him.
Now, I, Nephi, won’t recount everything my father wrote,as he recorded many visions and dreams; he also shared many prophecies and teachings with his children, which I will not fully describe.
But I will share my own story. Look, I am summarizing my father’s record onto plates I made by my own hands; after summarizing his record, I will detail my own life.
So, I want you to know that after the Lord showed my father, Lehi, so many wonderful things about the destruction of Jerusalem, he went among the people to prophesy and share what he had seen and heard.
The Jews mocked him for his testimony; he truly spoke of their wickedness and sins and foretold the coming of a Messiah and the redemption of the world.
When the Jews heard this, they were furious, just as they had been with past prophets whom they had cast out, stoned, and killed; they sought to take his life as well. But I, Nephi, will show you that the Lord's tender mercies are upon all whom He has chosen, and because of their faith, He gives them strength for deliverance.
