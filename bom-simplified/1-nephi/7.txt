After my father, Lehi, finished prophesying to his descendants, the Lord spoke to him again, telling him it was not good for Lehi to journey into the wilderness with his family alone. Instead, his sons were to marry so they could have children in the promised land.
The Lord instructed him that I, Nephi, and my brothers needed to return to Jerusalem to bring Ishmael and his family with us into the wilderness.
So I, Nephi, along with my brothers, went back into the wilderness to head to Jerusalem once more.
When we arrived at Ishmael's house, we found favor in his eyes and spoke to him about the Lord’s message.
The Lord changed Ishmael’s heart, as well as the hearts of his family, so they agreed to travel with us into the wilderness to meet our father.
As we traveled, Laman and Lemuel, along with two of Ishmael's daughters, two of Ishmael's sons, and their families, rebelled against us—against me, Nephi, Sam, our father Ishmael, and his wife, along with his three other daughters.
During this rebellion, they wanted to go back to Jerusalem.
Seeing their hard hearts saddened me, so I spoke to Laman and Lemuel: You are my older brothers, yet why are your hearts so hard and your minds so blind that I, your younger brother, need to lead by example?
Why have you not listened to the Lord's words?
Why have you forgotten that you saw an angel of the Lord?
And why have you forgotten the great miracles the Lord has performed for us, saving us from Laban and helping us obtain the record?
Why do you not remember that the Lord can do all things if we have faith in Him? So let’s be faithful.
If we are faithful, we will gain the promised land, and someday you will realize that what the Lord said about Jerusalem's destruction will happen; everything the Lord has spoken about this destruction will surely take place.
The Lord's Spirit will soon stop trying to reach them because they have ignored the prophets, even imprisoning Jeremiah. They have also tried to harm my father, driving him out of the land.
I tell you, if you go back to Jerusalem, you will also die with them. If you have the choice, go forward instead, and remember my words: if you go back, you will perish, for the Spirit of the Lord urges me to speak this.
After I, Nephi, said these words, my brothers became angry with me, laying hands on me. They were furious and bound me with cords, intending to kill me and leave me in the wilderness for wild animals to devour.
But I prayed to the Lord, saying: O Lord, please deliver me from my brothers because of my faith in you and give me the strength to break these ropes.
After I prayed, the cords on my hands and feet fell off, and I stood before my brothers and spoke to them again.
Once again, they were angry and tried to seize me, but one of Ishmael's daughters, her mother, and one of Ishmael's sons pleaded with my brothers, softening their hearts so they stopped trying to kill me.
They felt remorse for their wickedness and begged me for forgiveness.
I forgave them completely and encouraged them to pray to the Lord for forgiveness, and they did just that. After they prayed, we continued our journey to our father's tent.
We arrived at our father's tent, and after I, my brothers, and all of Ishmael's household got there, they thanked the Lord their God and offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to Him.
