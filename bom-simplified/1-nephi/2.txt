The Lord spoke to my father in a dream, saying: "Lehi, you are blessed for what you've done, for being faithful and declaring my words; your life is in danger because these people want to kill you."
Then the Lord commanded my father in a dream to take his family and leave into the wilderness.
He obeyed the Lord's command and did as He instructed.
So he left for the wilderness, taking only his family, food, and tents, leaving behind his house, land, gold, silver, and other valuables.
He journeyed near the Red Sea and traveled through the wilderness with his family, which included my mother, Sariah, and my older brothers, Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.
After three days in the wilderness, he set up his tent in a valley next to a river.
He built an altar using stones, made an offering to the Lord, and thanked God.
He named the river Laman, and it flowed into the Red Sea; the valley was located near its mouth.
When my father saw that the river connected to the Red Sea, he spoke to Laman, saying: "I hope you become like this river, always flowing into the source of true righteousness!"
He also spoke to Lemuel: "I hope you become like this valley, strong, steady, and unwavering in following the Lord's commandments!"
He said this because Laman and Lemuel were stubborn; they complained about many things regarding their father. They claimed he was a visionary man who had taken them away from Jerusalem, causing them to abandon their inheritance, gold, silver, and precious possessions to perish in the wilderness. They thought he did this because of foolish ideas he had.
Thus, Laman and Lemuel, being the oldest, complained against their father. They didn’t understand the ways of the God who created them.
They also didn’t believe that the great city of Jerusalem could be destroyed, as the prophets said. They were similar to the Jews in Jerusalem who wanted to kill my father.
Then my father spoke to them in the valley of Lemuel with great power, filled with the Spirit, making them tremble before him. He confounded them, so they didn’t dare speak against him, and they obeyed his commands.
My father lived in a tent.
I, Nephi, though still young, was tall and had a strong desire to understand God’s mysteries. I cried out to the Lord, and He visited me, softening my heart so that I believed all the words my father spoke; thus, I did not rebel against him like my brothers did.
I spoke to Sam, telling him what the Lord revealed to me through His Holy Spirit. Sam believed my words.
However, Laman and Lemuel refused to listen to me. Because I was saddened by their hard hearts, I prayed to the Lord for them.
The Lord spoke to me, saying: "You are blessed, Nephi, because of your faith; you have sought me earnestly and humbly."
If you keep my commandments, you will prosper and be led to a promised land—a land I have prepared for you, a choice land above all others.
If your brothers rebel against you, they will be cut off from my presence.
If you keep my commandments, you will become a ruler and a teacher over your brothers.
For when they rebel against me, I will curse them severely, and they will have no power over your descendants unless they also rebel against me.
If they rebel against me, they will become a scourge to your descendants, to remind them of their wrongdoing.
