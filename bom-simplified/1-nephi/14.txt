If the Gentiles listen to the Lamb of God, in that day He will reveal Himself to them through His words and powerful actions, removing their obstacles.
If they do not harden their hearts against the Lamb of God, they will be counted among the descendants of your father; indeed, they will be part of the house of Israel and will be a blessed people in the promised land forever; they will no longer be taken captive, and the house of Israel shall no longer be ashamed.
That deep pit dug for them by the great and wicked church, established by the devil and his followers to lead souls to hell—yes, that pit meant for the destruction of mankind will be filled by those who created it, leading to their ultimate ruin, says the Lamb of God; this destruction does not mean the death of the soul, except for being cast into an endless hell.
This reflects the devil's captivity and the justice of God upon all who choose to act wickedly and commit sinful acts before Him.
Then the angel spoke to me, Nephi, and said: You have seen that if the Gentiles repent, they will be blessed; and you also know about the Lord's promises to the house of Israel; and you have heard that those who do not repent will face destruction.
So, woe to the Gentiles if they harden their hearts against the Lamb of God.
For the time will come, says the Lamb of God, when I will perform a great and marvelous work among humanity; a work that will last forever, whether it brings peace and eternal life or leads to the hardening of their hearts and blindness in their minds, leading to their captivity and destruction, both in this life and spiritually, as referenced in the devil's captivity.
When the angel finished speaking, he asked me: Do you remember the promises of the Father to the house of Israel? I replied, Yes.
Then he told me: Look and see that wicked church, the mother of all wickedness, whose founder is the devil.
He said: There are only two churches; one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; therefore, anyone who does not belong to the church of the Lamb of God is part of that wicked church, which is the mother of all evil and is the whore of all the earth.
I then looked and saw the whore of all the earth seated upon many waters; she had control over all nations, tribes, languages, and peoples.
I then saw the church of the Lamb of God, which was small in number because of the wickedness and evils of the whore seated upon many waters; however, I saw that the church of the Lamb, made up of the saints of God, existed all over the earth, though their numbers were small due to the great whore's wicked acts.
I also saw that the great mother of all wickedness was gathering many people from all over the earth, from all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.
Then I, Nephi, witnessed the power of the Lamb of God, which came down upon the saints of the church and the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered across the earth; they were equipped with righteousness and the power of God in great glory.
I saw that God's anger was directed against that great and wicked church, leading to wars and rumors of wars among all the earth’s nations and people.
As wars started and rumors spread among all the nations belonging to the mother of evil, the angel said to me: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and look, you see all these things—
When the day comes that God's anger is unleashed upon the mother of harlots, the great and wicked church of all the earth with the devil as its founder, then that day will mark the beginning of the Father's work, preparing the way to fulfill His promises made to His people of the house of Israel.
Then the angel spoke to me again, saying: Look!
I turned and saw a man dressed in a white robe.
The angel said: Look, he is one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
He will see and write about these things; indeed, he will write about many things that have happened.
He will also write about the end of the world.
So, the things he will write are true and just; behold, they are recorded in the book that you saw coming from the mouth of the Jew; at that time, the things written were clear, pure, and invaluable, easily understood by everyone.
And behold, the writings of this apostle will contain many things you have seen; and you will see the rest.
But the things you will see later must not be written down; for the Lord God has set apart the apostle of the Lamb of God to be the one to write them.
Others have been shown everything, and they have written their accounts; these records will be revealed in their pure form, according to the truth found in the Lamb, in the Lord's perfect timing, for the house of Israel.
I, Nephi, have heard and testify that the apostle of the Lamb is named John, according to the angel’s message.
And behold, I, Nephi, have been commanded not to write what I saw and heard after this; thus, the things I have written are sufficient for me, and I have only written a small part of what I experienced.
I testify that I saw the things that my father saw, and the angel of the Lord made them known to me.
Now I've finished sharing what I saw while I was in the Spirit; if not everything I saw is recorded, what I have written is true. And so it is. Amen.
