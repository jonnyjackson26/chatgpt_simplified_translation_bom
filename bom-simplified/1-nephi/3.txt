Nephi returned to his father's tent after talking with the Lord.  
His father spoke to him, saying: I had a dream in which the Lord commanded that you and your brothers return to Jerusalem.  
Laban has the records of our people, as well as our family history, which are written on brass plates.  
So, the Lord has instructed me that you and your brothers should go to Laban's house to seek the records and bring them back to the wilderness.  
Now, your brothers are complaining, saying that what I've asked of them is too difficult; but actually, I haven't made this request—it’s a command from the Lord.  
Therefore, go, my son; you will be blessed by the Lord, because you have not complained.  
Nephi replied to his father: I will go and do what the Lord has commanded, for I know that the Lord doesn't give commandments without preparing a way for us to fulfill them.  
When his father heard these words, he was very happy, for he knew that Nephi had received a blessing from the Lord.  
Nephi and his brothers set out into the wilderness, taking their tents, to head towards Jerusalem.  
Once we reached Jerusalem, my brothers and I talked it over with each other.  
We drew lots to see who would go into Laban's house, and the lot fell to Laman. Laman went into Laban's house and spoke with him while he was sitting there.  
Laman asked Laban for the records engraved on the brass plates, which included our family history.  
But Laban became angry and kicked him out, refusing to give him the records. He accused Laman of being a thief and threatened to kill him.  
Laman hurried out and told us what had happened. We became very sad, and my brothers were ready to return to our father in the wilderness.  
But I told them: As the Lord lives, and as we live, we will not return to our father until we have accomplished what the Lord commanded us to do.  
So, let’s stay faithful to God's commandments; let’s go back to our father’s land, for he left behind gold, silver, and many riches because of the Lord's commandments.  
He knew that Jerusalem would be destroyed due to the people's wickedness.  
They have rejected the words of the prophets. If my father stayed in the land after being warned to flee, he would also be destroyed, so he must leave.  
And it is wise in God’s eyes that we obtain these records, so we can keep our ancestors' language alive for our children.  
Additionally, we need to preserve the words spoken by all the holy prophets since the beginning of the world up to this time.  
I used this kind of reasoning to persuade my brothers to remain faithful in keeping the Lord's commandments.  
Then we went back to our land of inheritance and gathered our gold, silver, and valuable items.  
After gathering these things, we went back to Laban's house.  
We entered Laban's house and asked him to give us the brass plates in exchange for our gold, silver, and valuable items.  
When Laban saw how much property we had, he wanted it so badly that he drove us out and sent his servants to kill us to take our possessions.  
We ran away from Laban's servants and had to leave our property behind, which Laban seized.  
We fled into the wilderness, and Laban’s servants did not catch us, so we hid in a rocky cave.  
Laman and Lemuel were upset with me and my father; they followed Laman's words and spoke harshly to us, their younger brothers, even hitting us with a rod.  
As they were hitting us, an angel of the Lord appeared before them and asked: Why are you hitting your younger brother? Don’t you realize that the Lord chose him to lead you because of your wrongdoings? You will go back to Jerusalem, and the Lord will hand Laban over to you.  
After the angel spoke, he left.  
Once the angel was gone, Laman and Lemuel began to complain again, saying: How can the Lord give Laban into our hands? He is a powerful man who can command fifty men, and he could kill us; so why wouldn't he?
