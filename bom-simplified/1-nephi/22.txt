Israel will be spread out all over the earth—In the last days, the Gentiles will care for and support Israel by sharing the gospel—Israel will be gathered and saved, and the wicked will be destroyed—The power of evil will be defeated, and Satan will be restrained. About 588–570 B.C.
After I, Nephi, read these records on the brass plates, my brothers asked me: What do these words mean? They wondered if they should be understood in a spiritual way, relating to what will happen through the spirit rather than the physical world.
I, Nephi, explained to them: These messages were revealed to the prophet through inspiration from the Spirit; everything is revealed to prophets by the Spirit regarding what will happen to humanity in the physical world.
Therefore, what I read refers to both physical and spiritual matters; it seems that the house of Israel will eventually be scattered all over the world and among all nations.
And indeed, many already have lost connection with those in Jerusalem. Most of the tribes have been led away; they are scattered across the seas, and nobody knows where they are, except that we know they have been led away.
Because they have been led away, prophecies have been made about them and about those who will later be scattered and be confused due to the Holy One of Israel; they will harden their hearts against Him, and they will be scattered among all nations and disliked by everyone.
However, after the Gentiles support them, and the Lord raises them up as a banner, and their children are cared for, these messages refer to physical matters; this is how the Lord's promises to our ancestors relate to us in the future, as well as all our brothers from the house of Israel.
It signals that the time will come when, after all of Israel has been scattered and confused, God will raise up a powerful nation among the Gentiles, even in this land; and through them, our descendants will be scattered.
Once our descendants are scattered, the Lord will perform a wonderful work among the Gentiles that will greatly benefit our descendants; it's like being nurtured by the Gentiles, being carried in their arms and on their shoulders.
This work will also be valuable for the Gentiles; and not just for them but for all of Israel, fulfilling the promises of Heaven's Father to Abraham, who was told: Through your descendants, all the families of the earth will be blessed.
I want you to understand that all families on earth can't be blessed unless God reveals His power to the nations.
Thus, the Lord will reveal His power to all nations by bringing His promises and gospel to the house of Israel.
Consequently, He will free them from captivity, gather them to their promised lands, bring them out of darkness, and they will understand that the Lord is their Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.
The blood of that wicked church, known as the great whore of all the earth, will fall upon them; they will fight among themselves, and the consequences of their own actions will return to them, and they will be consumed by their own violence.
Every nation that wars against you, O house of Israel, will turn against each other and fall into the trap they set for the Lord's people. All who oppose Zion will be destroyed, and that great whore, who has twisted the right ways of the Lord, will crumble to the ground, and its fall will be great.
For the prophet says, the time is coming swiftly when Satan will no longer possess power over the hearts of people; soon, those who are arrogant and wicked will be like dry grass, and they will face destruction.
The time is approaching when God's full wrath will be unleashed upon all humanity; He will not allow the wicked to destroy the righteous.
So, He will protect the righteous with His power, even if it means His full wrath must come, ensuring the righteous are safe, even if it requires their enemies to be destroyed by fire. Therefore, the righteous need not be afraid; the prophet says they will be saved, even if it means through fire.
Listen up, my brothers, I tell you that these events must happen soon; indeed, blood, fire, and smoke will soon cover the earth, coming to people as a result of their hard hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
The righteous will not perish; the time surely will come when all who fight against Zion will be cut off.
The Lord will certainly prepare a way for His people to fulfill Moses' words: A prophet will be raised up by the Lord your God, like me; you must listen to everything he says. Anyone who ignores that prophet will be separated from the people.
Now, I, Nephi, declare to you that the prophet Moses spoke of was the Holy One of Israel; He will judge fairly.
The righteous need not fear, for they will not be confused. But the kingdom of evil will be built among people, which is established among those in the physical world—
For the time will come swiftly when all churches built for profit, those seeking power over people, striving for popularity in the world, pursuing lust and doing wrong; indeed, everyone in the kingdom of evil will be those who should fear and tremble; they will be brought low, consumed like dry grass, as the prophet has foretold.
Soon, the righteous will be lifted up like calves from the barn, and the Holy One of Israel will reign with authority, might, and great glory.
He gathers His children from all corners of the earth; He knows His flock, and they recognize Him; there will be one fold and one shepherd; He will feed His sheep, and they will find rest in Him.
Because of the righteousness of His people, Satan has no power; he cannot act for many years, as he has no control over the hearts of people living righteously while the Holy One of Israel reigns.
Now I, Nephi, tell you that all these things will happen in the physical world.
However, all nations, families, languages, and people will find safety in the Holy One of Israel if they choose to repent.
Now I, Nephi, conclude; for I dare not speak further on these matters.
So, my brothers, I want you to think about the truth of what is written on the brass plates; they testify that a person must follow God's commandments.
Therefore, do not think that only my father and I have taught these truths. If you follow the commandments and persevere to the end, you will be saved in the last days. And that is the truth. Amen.
