The angel said to me: Look and see your descendants and your brothers' descendants. I looked and saw the promised land, with so many people that they were like the grains of sand on the beach.
Then I saw many people gathered to fight each other; I witnessed wars, battles, and many violent deaths among my people.
I watched as many generations passed away due to the wars and conflicts in the land, and I observed countless cities, so many that I couldn't count them all.
I saw a foggy darkness covering the promised land; there were lightning flashes, loud thunder, earthquakes, and chaotic noises; the ground split apart, mountains crumbled, plains were broken, many cities sank, some burned in fire, and others fell to the earth due to the trembling of the ground.
After seeing these things, I noticed that the darkness lifted from the earth, and I saw many who had survived the terrible judgments of the Lord.
I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God coming down from heaven; He approached and revealed Himself to them.
I also witnessed that the Holy Ghost descended upon twelve others, and they were chosen and ordained by God.
The angel spoke to me, saying: Look at the twelve disciples of the Lamb, chosen to serve your descendants.
He asked me: Do you remember the twelve apostles of the Lamb? They will be the ones judging the twelve tribes of Israel; your twelve ministers will be judged by them since you belong to the house of Israel.
These twelve ministers you see will judge your descendants. They are righteous forever; because of their faith in the Lamb of God, their garments are as white as His blood makes them.
The angel told me: Look! I saw three generations pass away in righteousness; their garments were as white as the Lamb of God. The angel explained: They are made white in the blood of the Lamb due to their faith in Him.
I, Nephi, also saw many from the fourth generation who passed away righteously.
I then saw the countless people of the earth gathered together.
The angel told me: Behold your descendants and your brothers' descendants.
I looked and noticed my descendants gathered in great numbers against my brothers' descendants, preparing for battle.
The angel said to me: Look at the filthy water that your father saw; it's the same river he spoke of, and its depths are the depths of hell.
The mist of darkness represents the devil's temptations, which blind people's eyes, harden their hearts, and lead them away down wide roads to their destruction.
The large, fancy building that your father saw represents empty dreams and the pride of mankind. A vast and terrible divide separates them; this is the justice of the Eternal God and the Messiah, the Lamb of God, whom the Holy Ghost testifies about from the beginning of time to now and forever.
While the angel was speaking, I saw my brothers' descendants fighting against mine, just as the angel said; due to the pride of my descendants and the devil's temptations, my brothers' descendants were able to overpower my people.
I witnessed the descendants of my brothers defeating my people, and they spread across the land in great numbers.
I saw them gather in crowds; I witnessed wars and rumors of wars among them, and throughout these wars and conflicts, many generations passed away.
The angel told me: Look, these people will fall away from belief.
I then saw that after they fell into disbelief, they became dark, disgusting, and filthy, filled with laziness and every kind of wickedness.
