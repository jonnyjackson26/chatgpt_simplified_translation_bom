After I wanted to understand the visions my father had seen, and I believed the Lord could reveal them to me, while I was thinking deeply, I was suddenly taken away by the Spirit of the Lord to a very high mountain that I had never seen before.
The Spirit asked me: What do you want?
I replied: I want to see the things my father witnessed.
The Spirit asked: Do you believe your father saw the tree he described?
I responded: Yes, I believe everything my father said.
After I said this, the Spirit shouted with a loud voice, saying: Praise be to the Lord, the greatest God; for He is the ruler of all the earth, above all things. And you, Nephi, are blessed because you believe in the Son of the greatest God; therefore, you will see what you desire.
And this will be a sign for you: after you see the tree that produced the fruit your father tasted, you will also see a man coming down from heaven, and you shall witness him; after witnessing him, you will testify that he is the Son of God.
Then the Spirit told me: Look! I looked and saw a tree, similar to the one my father had seen; its beauty was beyond anything, exceeding all other beauty, and it was whiter than pure snow.
Once I saw the tree, I said to the Spirit: You have shown me the most precious tree of all.
The Spirit asked: What do you want?
I said: I want to understand its meaning—because I spoke to him as one man speaks to another; I realized he appeared in human form; yet, I knew it was the Spirit of the Lord, and he spoke to me as a person speaks to another.
Then he said to me: Look! I looked to see him, but he was no longer there.
I then looked and saw the great city of Jerusalem and other cities. I saw the city of Nazareth, and in Nazareth, I saw a virgin who was exceptionally beautiful and fair.
I then saw the heavens open, and an angel descended and stood before me. He asked me: Nephi, what do you see?
I replied: A virgin, more beautiful than all other virgins.
He asked me: Do you understand the condescension of God?
I said: I know He loves His children; however, I don’t understand everything.
He told me: Look, the virgin you see is the mother of the Son of God, in the flesh.
Then I saw her taken away in the Spirit; after a while, the angel spoke to me again, saying: Look!
I looked and saw the virgin again, holding a child.
The angel said: Behold the Lamb of God, the Son of the Eternal Father! Do you understand the meaning of the tree your father saw?
I answered: Yes, it represents the love of God, which spreads throughout the hearts of mankind; therefore, it is the most desirable thing of all.
He responded: Yes, and it brings the greatest joy to the soul.
After saying this, he said: Look! I looked, and I saw the Son of God among the people; many fell at his feet and worshipped him.
Then I saw that the iron rod, which my father had seen, represented the word of God, leading to the fountain of living waters, or the tree of life; these waters symbolize the love of God; and I also saw that the tree of life represented the love of God.
The angel told me again: Look and witness the condescension of God!
I looked and saw the Redeemer of the world, whom my father had described; I also saw the prophet who would prepare the way before him. The Lamb of God went forth and was baptized by him; after this baptism, I saw the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost descended and rested upon him like a dove.
I saw him ministering to the people with great power and glory; many gathered to hear him, but I also saw that they expelled him from among them.
I noticed twelve others following him. Then they were taken away by the Spirit, and I no longer saw them.
The angel spoke to me again, saying: Look! I looked and saw the heavens open again, with angels coming down to serve the people.
He spoke to me again, saying: Look! I looked and saw the Lamb of God among the people. I saw many who were sick and afflicted with all kinds of diseases and evil spirits; the angel showed me these things. They were healed by the power of the Lamb of God, and the evil spirits were cast out.
Then the angel spoke to me again, saying: Look! I looked and saw the Lamb of God being taken by the people; indeed, the Son of the everlasting God was judged by the world; I saw and can testify of this.
And I, Nephi, saw that he was raised upon the cross and killed for the sins of the world.
After he was killed, I saw the people of the earth gathering to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for these were the twelve that the angel of the Lord had called.
The people were gathered in a large and spacious building, similar to the one my father had seen. Then the angel of the Lord spoke to me again, saying: Look at the world and its wisdom; behold, the house of Israel has gathered to fight against the twelve apostles.
I saw and can testify that the large and spacious building represented the pride of the world; it fell down, and the destruction was great. The angel of the Lord spoke to me again, saying: Thus will be the downfall of all nations, families, languages, and people that fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
