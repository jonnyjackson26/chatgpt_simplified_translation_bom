The wicked find it hard to accept the truth—Lehi’s sons marry Ishmael's daughters—The Liahona leads them in the wilderness—Messages from God appear on the Liahona from time to time—Ishmael dies; his family complains about their hardships.
After I, Nephi, finished talking to my brothers, they told me: You have told us things that are difficult, more than we can handle.
I told them that I knew I had spoken tough truths about the wicked; and I have justified the righteous, explaining that they will be rewarded in the end. Thus, the guilty find the truth hard because it strikes them deeply.
Brothers, if you were righteous and open to the truth, wanting to live rightly before God, you wouldn’t complain because of the truth, saying: You speak harshly about us.
I, Nephi, urged my brothers earnestly to follow the Lord’s commandments.
They humbled themselves before the Lord; and I felt joy and great hope that they would choose to follow the right path.
All these events occurred while my father lived in a tent in the valley he named Lemuel.
I, Nephi, married one of Ishmael's daughters, and my brothers also married Ishmael's daughters, as did Zoram, who married Ishmael's eldest daughter.
Thus, my father fulfilled all the Lord's commandments given to him. And I, Nephi, received many blessings from the Lord.
One night, the Lord spoke to my father, directing him to journey into the wilderness the next day.
When my father woke up in the morning and went to the tent door, he was astonished to see a round ball of intricate design on the ground; it was made of fine brass. Inside the ball were two spindles, and one pointed the way we were to go in the wilderness.
We gathered all the things we would take into the wilderness, as well as the remaining provisions the Lord had provided; we also took seeds of every kind.
We then packed our tents and headed into the wilderness, crossing the river Laman.
We traveled for four days, mostly heading south-southeast, and set up our tents again, naming the place Shazer.
We took our bows and arrows and went into the wilderness to hunt for our families; after securing food, we returned to Shazer. We went back out into the wilderness, following the same route and staying in the best areas near the Red Sea.
We traveled for many days, hunting along the way with our bows and arrows, as well as stones and slings.
We followed the guidance of the ball, which led us to the more fertile areas in the wilderness.
After many days of travel, we set up our tents for a while so we could rest and gather food for our families.
When I, Nephi, went out to hunt, I unfortunately broke my bow, which was made of fine steel. After breaking my bow, my brothers were upset with me because we couldn’t find any food.
We returned to our families empty-handed and very tired; they suffered greatly from hunger due to our long journey.
Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael began to complain loudly about their hardships in the wilderness; my father also started to complain against God. They were all deeply sorrowful for their situation and voiced their complaints against the Lord.
Because of losing my bow and watching my brothers’ bows lose their springs, we found it extremely difficult to get food.
I spoke to my brothers often because they had hardened their hearts and started to complain against the Lord.
So I made a bow out of wood and fashioned an arrow from a straight stick; I equipped myself with these weapons along with a sling and stones. Then I asked my father: Where should I go to find food?
He sought the Lord’s guidance, having humbled himself due to my words, which I spoke with deep conviction.
The Lord’s voice came to my father, chastising him for his complaints against God and bringing him to a state of deep sorrow.
The Lord told him: Look at the ball and see what is written on it.
When my father looked, he was filled with fear and trembled greatly, as did my brothers, the sons of Ishmael, and our wives.
I, Nephi, saw the pointers on the ball working according to the faith, effort, and attention we gave to them.
There was also new writing upon it that was easy to read, giving us understanding about God’s ways; this writing changed from time to time according to our faith and diligence. Thus, we can see how by small means, the Lord can accomplish great things.
I, Nephi, climbed to the top of the mountain, following the directions on the ball.
I hunted wild animals there and collected food for our families.
When I returned to our tents with the food I had gathered, joy filled their hearts! They humbled themselves before the Lord and thanked Him.
We then continued on our journey, retracing nearly the same route as before. After many days of travel, we set up our tents again to rest for a while.
Ishmael died and was buried in a place called Nahom.
The daughters of Ishmael mourned greatly for their father and for their struggles in the wilderness; they complained against my father for bringing them out of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead! We have wandered a lot in the wilderness and faced many hardships, hunger, thirst, and exhaustion; now, after all this suffering, we will die here of hunger.
Thus, they complained against my father and me, expressing a desire to return to Jerusalem.
Laman said to Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael: Let us kill our father and our brother Nephi, who took it upon himself to lead and teach us, despite being the younger brother.
He claimed that the Lord had spoken to him and that angels had visited him. But we know he is lying; he tells us these things and does many things to deceive us, perhaps hoping to lead us into some strange wilderness and then make himself king and ruler over us, doing whatever he pleases with us. In this way, Laman incited anger in their hearts.
The Lord was with us; indeed, the voice of the Lord spoke many words to them, chastening them severely. After that, they turned away their anger and repented of their wrongdoings, so the Lord blessed us with food, ensuring we would not perish.
