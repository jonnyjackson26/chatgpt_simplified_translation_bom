We resumed our journey through the wilderness and traveled almost entirely eastward from that point on. During this time, we faced many hardships in the wilderness, and our women gave birth to children amidst our struggles.
The Lord blessed us greatly; even while we survived on raw meat, our women were able to breastfeed their children and showed extraordinary strength, similar to the men, and they continued on our journey without complaining.
Thus, we see that God's commandments must be fulfilled. If people follow God's commandments, He supports them, strengthens them, and provides what they need to do what He has asked. So, He provided for us while we were traveling in the wilderness.
We spent many years in the wilderness—eight years in total.
Eventually, we arrived at a land we named Bountiful because of its abundant fruit and wild honey. Everything there was provided by the Lord to keep us from dying. We also saw the ocean, which we named Irreantum, meaning "many waters."
We set up our tents by the shore. Despite all the hardships we faced, which are too many to write about, we felt immense joy when we reached the shore and called the place Bountiful for its rich resources.
After spending many days in Bountiful, I, Nephi, heard the Lord's voice telling me to go up into the mountain. I followed His command and went up the mountain to pray.
The Lord spoke to me, instructing me to build a ship according to His design so I could carry my people across these waters.
I asked the Lord where I could find metal to make tools for constructing the ship as He had shown me.
The Lord directed me to the place where I could find the ore to make the tools.
So, I made a bellows out of animal skins to blow the fire, and then I struck two stones together to create fire.
Previously, the Lord had not allowed us to make much fire while we traveled in the wilderness, saying, "I will make your food sweet so you won’t need to cook it."
He also promised to be our light in the wilderness and to prepare our way if we kept His commandments; thus, if we followed His commandments, we would be guided to the promised land and recognize that it was Him leading us.
The Lord also said, "Once you reach the promised land, you will know that I am God, and that I delivered you from destruction; I led you out of Jerusalem."
So, I, Nephi, worked hard to keep the Lord’s commandments, and I encouraged my brothers to be faithful and diligent.
I used the ore I had melted from the rock to make tools.
When my brothers saw that I was preparing to build a ship, they began to complain, saying, "Our brother is foolish; he thinks he can build a ship and cross these vast waters."
My brothers continued to grumble, wanting to avoid work because they didn’t believe I could build a ship, nor that I had received instructions from the Lord.
I felt deep sorrow because of their stubbornness; when they noticed my sadness, they took joy in it, saying, "We knew you couldn't build a ship; you don't have good judgment, so you can’t accomplish such a great task."
They compared me to our father, claiming he was misled by foolish thoughts. They reminded me how he led us away from Jerusalem into the wilderness, where we have suffered for many years. Our women have endured hardships while giving birth, and they have faced everything except death itself; they would have been better off dead than to have gone through such trials.
Look at how we’ve suffered in the wilderness for all these years, when we could have enjoyed our home and land of inheritance, and we could have been happy.
We know that the people in Jerusalem were righteous because they followed all of God’s laws and commandments. Therefore, we conclude that they are righteous, and our father has judged them and led us away because we listened to his words. They asserted that my brother was just like him and continued to complain like this.
So, I, Nephi, asked them, "Do you think our ancestors, the Israelites, would have been rescued from the Egyptians if they hadn’t listened to the Lord’s words?"
Do you think they would have escaped slavery if the Lord hadn’t commanded Moses to lead them out?
You know that the Israelites were enslaved and overwhelmed with hard tasks to bear, so surely it was a good thing that they were freed from bondage.
You also know that Moses was commanded by the Lord to perform that great work, and by his command, the Red Sea was divided, allowing them to pass through on dry ground.
But the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, those armies of Pharaoh.
You also remember that they were provided manna to eat in the wilderness.
Yes, and you know that Moses, through the power of God within him, struck a rock and water flowed out so the Israelites could drink.
Despite being guided by the Lord their God, their Redeemer, who led them by day and provided light at night, they still hardened their hearts, blinded their minds, and spoke against Moses and the living God.
So, according to His word, He destroyed them and led them; everything happened by His command.
Once they crossed the river Jordan, He made them mighty to drive out the inhabitants of that land, leading them to destruction.
Now, do you think the people in this promised land who were driven out by our ancestors were righteous? I tell you, no.
Do you think our ancestors would have been better if they had been righteous? I tell you, no.
The Lord sees all people as one; whoever is righteous is favored by God. However, this people rejected God’s words and were filled with sin; they were under God's wrath, and He cursed their land and blessed it for our ancestors, giving them power over it.
God created the earth to be inhabited and His children to possess it.
He raises up righteous nations and destroys wicked ones.
He guides the righteous to good lands while punishing the wicked and cursing the land to their detriment.
He reigns high in the heavens, and the earth is His footstool.
He loves those who choose Him as their God. He loved our fathers and made covenants with them, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He remembered those promises and brought them out of Egypt.
In the wilderness, He tested them because they had hardened their hearts, just like you have; He sent fiery serpents among them, and when they were bitten, He provided a way for them to be healed. Their task was simply to look, but many perished because they couldn’t accept the simplicity of it.
They hardened their hearts repeatedly and spoke against Moses and God, yet you know they were powerfully led to the promised land.
Now, after all these experiences, they have become wicked, nearly completely sinful, and I fear they are about to be destroyed, except for a few who might be taken into captivity.
The Lord commanded my father to leave into the wilderness because the Jews wanted to kill him; and you too have sought to kill him; thus, you are murderers at heart and similar to them.
You are quick to commit sins but slow to remember the Lord your God. You have seen an angel who spoke to you; you have heard His voice from time to time, but have become insensitive, unable to feel His words; so, He has spoken to you as thunder, making the earth tremble.
You also know that by the power of His almighty word, He can cause the earth to pass away; He can make rough places smooth and smooth areas broken. So, why is your heart so hardened?
My soul is filled with anguish and my heart is pained; I fear you might be abandoned forever. I am overflowing with the Spirit of God, and it gives me no strength.
When I finished speaking, they became angry and wanted to throw me into the sea. As they approached to harm me, I said to them: "In the name of the Almighty God, do not touch me, for I am filled with the power of God, and anyone who lays a hand on me will wither like a dried reed; they will be powerless before God’s might."
I, Nephi, told them to stop complaining about their father and to not withhold their help from me, for God had commanded me to build a ship.
I said to them: "If God commands me to do anything, I can accomplish it. If He tells me to turn this water into earth, it will happen."
If the Lord has such power and has performed many miracles among people, why would He not be able to instruct me on how to build a ship?
I, Nephi, spoke many things to my brothers, leaving them confused and unable to argue with me; they dared not touch me at all for many days. They were afraid to do this because the Spirit of God was so powerful within me.
Then, the Lord told me to reach out my hand again to my brothers, promising they wouldn't wither, but He would shake them so they might know I am the Lord their God.
So I reached out to them, and they did not wither; but the Lord shook them, just as He said.
Then they acknowledged, "We know for certain that the Lord is with you; it is clear that His power has shaken us." They fell before me, about to worship me, but I refused and said, "I am your brother, even the younger one; therefore, worship the Lord your God and honor your parents so you may live long in the land the Lord is giving you."
