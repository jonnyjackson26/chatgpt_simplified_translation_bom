Nephi creates two sets of records—Each is called the plates of Nephi—The larger plates contain regular history, while the smaller ones focus mainly on spiritual matters. About 600–592 B.C.
My father experienced, heard, and talked about all these things while living in a tent in the valley of Lemuel, as well as many other things that cannot be recorded on these plates.
Now, as I mention these plates, understand that they are not the ones where I write a complete history of my people. The plates where I keep a full account of my people are named after me, Nephi; therefore, they are referred to as the plates of Nephi, and this set is also called the plates of Nephi.
However, I have been instructed by the Lord to create these plates with the specific goal of recording the ministry of my people.
The other plates should contain a record of the kings' reigns, and the conflicts and struggles of my people; thus, these plates mainly focus on the ministry, while the other plates primarily document the reigns of kings and the wars and disputes of my people.
Therefore, the Lord has commanded me to make these plates for a meaningful reason that I do not fully understand.
But the Lord knows everything from the beginning; thus, He prepares a way to fulfill all His plans among humanity; for He has the power to bring all His words to pass. And so it is. Amen.
