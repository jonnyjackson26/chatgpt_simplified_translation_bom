The Messiah will be a light for all nations and will set free those who are imprisoned—Israel will be united with strength in the last days—Kings will care for them like mothers. This is similar to what Isaiah said. About 588–570 B.C.
Listen, O people of Israel, all of you who have been separated and driven away because of the wrongdoing of the leaders of my people; yes, all of you who have been scattered, who belong to my people, O house of Israel. Pay attention, O distant lands, and hear, you people from afar; the Lord has called me since I was born; even before I was born, my name was known.
He has made my speech like a sharp sword; he has hidden me in the shelter of his hand, and he has prepared me like a polished arrow; he has concealed me in his quiver.
And he said to me: You are my servant, O Israel, through whom I will be honored.
Then I said, I have worked hard for nothing; I have used my strength for no good reason; surely my cause is with the Lord, and my work is with my God.
And now, the Lord says—who formed me from birth to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him—even if Israel is not gathered, I will still be honored in the eyes of the Lord, and my God will be my strength.
And he said: It is a small thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and to bring back those of Israel who remain. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, so that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.
Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to the one whom people despise, to the one whom nations reject, to the servant of rulers: Kings will see you and rise, and princes will bow down because the Lord is faithful.
Thus says the Lord: At the right time I have listened to you, O distant islands, and in a day of salvation I have helped you; I will protect you and give you my servant as a promise to the people, to help rebuild the earth and restore the abandoned lands.
So you may tell the prisoners: Come out; to those who sit in darkness: Show yourselves. They will find food along the paths, and their pastures will be on high ground.
They will not go hungry or thirsty, nor will they be scorched by the heat or the sun; for the one who is merciful to them will lead them, and he will guide them by the springs of water.
I will make all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be elevated.
And then, O house of Israel, look, these will come from far away; and here, these will come from the north and west; and these from the land of Sinim.
Sing, O heavens; and rejoice, O earth; for those in the east will be established; and shout for joy, O mountains; for they will be hurt no more; for the Lord has comforted his people and will show compassion to his suffering ones.
But, look, Zion has said: The Lord has abandoned me, and my Lord has forgotten me—but he will prove that he has not.
Can a mother forget the child she is nursing, and not care for her own flesh and blood? Yes, she might forget, but I will never forget you, O house of Israel.
Look, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your city walls are always before me.
Your children will quickly rise up against your enemies; those who ruined you will leave you.
Lift your eyes and see; all these gather together, and they will come to you. And as I live, says the Lord, you will surely adorn yourself with them all like jewelry, and tie them on like a bride.
For your abandoned and desolate places, and the land that has been destroyed, will soon become too small because of the number of its inhabitants; and those who took everything from you will be far away.
The children you will have, after losing the first, will again say in your ears: This place is too small for me; make room for me to live.
Then you will think to yourself: Who has given me these, since I have lost my children, and am desolate, moving about as a captive? Who has raised these? Look, I was left alone; where did these come from?
Thus says the Lord God: Look, I will raise my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard for the people; and they will carry your sons in their arms, and your daughters will be held on their shoulders.
Kings will care for you like nursing fathers, and their queens like nursing mothers; they will bow down to you with their faces to the ground and lick the dust off your feet; and you will know that I am the Lord; for those who wait for me will not be disappointed.
Can anyone take something away from a strong person, or set free those who are held lawfully captive?
But thus says the Lord, even the captives of the strong will be taken away, and the spoils of the terrible will be rescued; for I will fight against those who are fighting against you, and I will save your children.
I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; they will be drunk with their own blood as if it were sweet wine; and all people will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
