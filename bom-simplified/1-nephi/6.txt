Nephi writes about the matters concerning God—his goal is to encourage people to turn to the God of Abraham and find salvation. Around 600–592 B.C.
Now, I, Nephi, will not provide the family history of my ancestors in this part of my record; nor will I include it later on these plates I am writing; because it's already recorded by my father; so, I won’t repeat it here.
It’s enough for me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.
I don’t feel the need to give a detailed account of everything my father did, as those things cannot fit on these plates, since I want to make space to write about God's matters.
My main goal is to persuade people to turn to the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and to find salvation.
Therefore, I won’t write about things that are appealing to the world, but instead about things that please God and those who are not focused on worldly matters.
Thus, I will instruct my descendants not to fill these plates with things of little value for humanity.
