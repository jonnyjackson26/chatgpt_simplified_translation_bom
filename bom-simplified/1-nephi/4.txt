I spoke to my brothers, saying: Let’s go back to Jerusalem and be faithful in following the Lord’s commandments; after all, He is stronger than anyone on earth, so He is certainly stronger than Laban and his fifty men, or even his tens of thousands.
So let’s go; let’s be strong like Moses, who spoke to the waters of the Red Sea and they parted, allowing our ancestors to escape captivity on dry land while Pharaoh’s armies drowned.
You know this is true; you’ve even heard from an angel, so why doubt? Let’s go; the Lord can rescue us just as He did our ancestors, and He can destroy Laban like He did the Egyptians.
After I said this, my brothers were still angry and continued to complain; still, they followed me until we reached the outer walls of Jerusalem.
It was nighttime, and I had them hide outside the walls. After they concealed themselves, I, Nephi, quietly entered the city and made my way to Laban’s house.
I was guided by the Spirit, not knowing in advance what I was meant to do.
As I approached Laban's house, I saw a man who had fallen to the ground because he was drunk.
When I got closer, I realized it was Laban.
I saw his sword and took it out of its sheath; the hilt was pure gold, and it was beautifully made. The blade was of very high-quality steel.
The Spirit urged me to kill Laban, but I thought to myself: I have never killed anyone. I hesitated, wishing I wouldn’t have to do it.
The Spirit spoke to me again, saying: Look, the Lord has placed him in your hands. I remembered that he had sought to kill me, refused to follow God’s commandments, and had taken our belongings.
Then the Spirit told me again: Kill him, for the Lord has given him into your hands.
The Lord removes the wicked to fulfill His righteous purposes. It is better for one person to die than for a whole nation to lose faith and perish.
When I, Nephi, heard these words, I remembered what the Lord had said to me in the wilderness: As long as your descendants keep my commandments, they will prosper in the promised land.
I thought that they wouldn’t be able to follow the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses unless they had the law.
And I knew that the law was written on the plates of brass.
Again, I realized that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands so that I could obtain the records as He commanded.
So I obeyed the Spirit's voice, grabbed Laban by the hair, and killed him with his own sword.
After I killed him with his sword, I took Laban’s clothes and wore them completely; I even put on his armor.
Once I had done this, I went to Laban’s treasury. As I approached, I saw Laban’s servant who had the keys to the treasury. I commanded him, using Laban’s voice, to come with me into the treasury.
He thought I was Laban because of my clothes and the sword I wore.
He spoke to me about the elders of the Jews, knowing that Laban had been out at night among them.
I answered him as if I were Laban.
I also told him I was carrying the engravings on the plates of brass to my older brothers who were outside the walls.
I instructed him to follow me.
He believed I was talking about the leaders of the church, and since he thought I was really Laban, he followed me.
He asked me many times about the Jewish elders as I went to my brothers waiting outside the walls.
When Laman saw me, he was very scared, as were Lemuel and Sam. They ran away, thinking it was Laban who had killed me and was now trying to take their lives too.
I called after them, and they heard me; so they stopped fleeing from me.
Then Laban’s servant saw my brothers and began to tremble, ready to run back to Jerusalem.
I, Nephi, being tall and strengthened by the Lord, grabbed Laban’s servant to stop him from fleeing.
I spoke to him, saying if he would listen to me, as the Lord lives and I live, if he obeyed our words, we would spare his life.
I assured him with an oath that he didn’t need to fear; he would be free like us if he came with us into the wilderness.
I also told him: Surely the Lord has commanded us to do this; shouldn’t we diligently follow His commandments? Therefore, if you will come with us to my father in the wilderness, we will make a place for you.
Zoram found courage in the words I spoke. Zoram was the servant’s name, and he promised to follow us into the wilderness. He also made an oath that he would stay with us from then on.
We wanted him to stay with us so that the Jews wouldn’t discover our escape into the wilderness and pursue us to destroy us.
When Zoram made his promise to us, our fears about him subsided.
We took the plates of brass and Laban’s servant and went into the wilderness, journeying to our father’s tent.
