And then the angel spoke to me, saying: Look! So I looked and saw many nations and kingdoms.
The angel asked me: What do you see? I replied: I see many nations and kingdoms.
He explained: These are the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles.
As I continued to look among the Gentile nations, I noticed a large and terrible church taking shape.
The angel then told me: Look at this church, which is more wicked than any other; it kills the saints of God, tortures them, binds them with chains, and takes them into captivity.
I saw that this great and wicked church was founded by the devil.
I also saw wealth: gold, silver, silks, scarlet cloth, fine linen, and all kinds of luxurious clothing, along with many prostitutes.
The angel said to me: Look at the gold, silver, silks, scarlet clothing, fine linen, and expensive clothing, along with the prostitutes; these represent the desires of this great and wicked church.
They destroy the saints of God for the praise of the world and take them into captivity.
I then saw many large bodies of water, which separated the Gentiles from the descendants of my brothers.
The angel said to me: Notice that God’s anger is directed at your brothers' descendants.
I saw a man among the Gentiles, who was separated from my brothers by those many waters. Then I saw the Spirit of God come down and act upon him, and he traveled across the waters to reach my brothers, who were in the promised land.
I saw the Spirit of God also affect other Gentiles as they left captivity and traveled across the waters.
I noticed many Gentiles in the promised land and saw that God's anger was upon my brothers' descendants; they were scattered and beaten by the Gentiles.
The Spirit of the Lord was with the Gentiles, and they prospered, inheriting the land. I noticed they looked fair and beautiful, like my people had before they were killed.
I, Nephi, saw that the Gentiles who had escaped captivity humbled themselves before the Lord, and the Lord’s power was with them.
I observed that their Gentile parents gathered on the waters and on land to fight against them.
I also saw that God’s power was with them, and His anger was upon all who were gathered to fight them.
I, Nephi, saw that the Gentiles who had escaped captivity were saved by God's power from all other nations.
I noticed that they prospered in the land and saw a book being carried among them.
The angel asked me: Do you know what this book means?
I replied: I don’t know.
He said: This book comes from the mouth of a Jew. I, Nephi, saw it; and he told me: The book you see is a record of the Jews, containing the Lord's covenants with the house of Israel; it also includes many prophecies from holy prophets. It is a record similar to the engravings on the brass plates, though it does not contain as many. Nevertheless, it contains the Lord's covenants, making it very valuable to the Gentiles.
The angel of the Lord said: You have seen that the book comes from a Jew; when it came from a Jew, it contained the fullness of the Lord's gospel, as recorded by the twelve apostles, who testify of the truth found in the Lamb of God.
Thus, these teachings go from the Jews in their pure form to the Gentiles, reflecting the truth that is in God.
After being delivered by the twelve apostles from the Jews to the Gentiles, you will notice the formation of that great and wicked church, the most wicked of all churches, because they have removed many plain and precious parts from the gospel of the Lamb, and many of the Lord's covenants have also been removed.
They have done all this to distort the right ways of the Lord and to blind the eyes and harden the hearts of people.
Therefore, you will see that after the book is sent out through this great and wicked church, many plain and precious things are missing from the book, which is the book of the Lamb of God.
Once these plain and precious teachings are removed, the book will spread to all nations of the Gentiles; and when it reaches all the nations, even across the many waters you've seen with the Gentiles who have escaped captivity, you will notice that due to the missing plain and precious teachings, which are easy to understand, many will stumble so much that Satan will have great control over them.
However, you will see that the Gentiles who have escaped captivity and have been raised by God's power above all other nations, on this choice land that the Lord God promised your father would belong to his descendants; thus, you will see that the Lord God will not allow the Gentiles to completely destroy the mixture of your descendants among your brothers.
He will not allow the Gentiles to destroy your brothers' descendants.
Nor will the Lord God allow the Gentiles to remain in that terrible state of blindness you see, which is due to the plain and precious parts of the Lamb of God’s gospel that have been hidden by that wicked church, which you have witnessed.
For this reason, the Lamb of God declares: I will show mercy to the Gentiles during the time of judgment upon the remnant of Israel.
Then the angel of the Lord spoke to me, saying: Listen, the Lamb of God says that after I have judged the remnant of Israel—and this remnant is your father's seed—after I have judged them and struck them through the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles stumble greatly due to the plain and precious parts of the Lamb of God’s gospel that have been hidden by that wicked church, which is the mother of prostitutes, says the Lamb—I will show mercy to the Gentiles in that time, bringing to them much of my gospel, which will be clear and precious, says the Lamb.
For, behold, says the Lamb: I will make myself known to your seed, and they will write many things that I will teach them, which will be clear and precious; after your seed is destroyed and loses their faith, and after the seed of your brothers, behold, these teachings will be hidden, only to come forth to the Gentiles through the gift and power of the Lamb.
In them will be written my gospel, says the Lamb, and my rock and my salvation.
Blessed are those who seek to establish my Zion in those days, for they will have the gift and power of the Holy Ghost; if they remain faithful until the end, they will be lifted up on the last day and saved in the eternal kingdom of the Lamb; and how beautiful will be the footsteps of those who bring good news and glad tidings upon the mountains.
I then saw the remnant of my brothers’ descendants along with the book of the Lamb of God, which had come from the mouth of a Jew, as it went from the Gentiles to the remnant of my brothers’ descendants.
After it reached them, I saw other books that came forth by the power of the Lamb from the Gentiles to them, aimed at convincing both the Gentiles and the remnant of my brothers’ descendants, as well as the scattered Jews everywhere, that the records of the prophets and the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.
The angel said to me: The last records you have seen among the Gentiles will confirm the truth of the first records from the twelve apostles and will reveal the plain and precious things that were removed from them; they will show all nations, tribes, and peoples that the Lamb of God is the Son of the Eternal Father and the Savior of the world; and that everyone must come to Him, or they cannot be saved.
And they must approach according to the words established by the Lamb; these words will be revealed in the records of your seed and also in the records of the twelve apostles; therefore, both will be united into one, since there is one God and one Shepherd over all the earth.
The time will come when He will reveal Himself to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; then, after He has revealed Himself to the Jews and the Gentiles, He will finally reveal Himself again to both groups, and the last will be first, and the first will be last.
