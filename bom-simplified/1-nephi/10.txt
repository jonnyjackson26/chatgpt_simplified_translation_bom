Nephi begins to record his experiences, reign, and ministry. To do this, he will share some details about his father and his brothers.
After finishing his story about his dream and encouraging his family to work hard, he talked to them about the Jewish people—
He stated that Jerusalem would be destroyed, and many would be taken captive to Babylon. However, at the right time determined by God, they would return and regain their homeland.
Indeed, six hundred years after my father left Jerusalem, God would raise up a prophet among the Jews—a Messiah, or Savior for the world.
He also mentioned how many prophets had testified about this coming Messiah and Redeemer.
Because of this, all people were lost and in a fallen state, and would remain so unless they relied on this Redeemer.
He spoke about a prophet who would come before the Messiah to prepare the way for the Lord—
This prophet would go into the wilderness and proclaim: "Make way for the Lord and straighten His paths; there is someone among you whom you don't recognize, and He is greater than I, and I am not worthy to untie His sandals." My father talked a lot about this.
He said this prophet would baptize in Bethabara, across the Jordan River, and he would baptize with water, even the Messiah himself.
After baptizing the Messiah, he would see and testify that he had baptized the Lamb of God who would take away the sins of the world.
After sharing these thoughts, my father spoke to my brothers about the gospel that would be shared among the Jews and how they would be increasingly faithless. After they crucified the Messiah, He would rise from the dead, showing Himself through the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles.
Yes, my father also talked a lot about the Gentiles and the house of Israel, comparing them to an olive tree whose branches would break off and spread out across the earth.
He said it was necessary for us to be led together to the promised land to fulfill God's word, and that we would be scattered all over the earth.
After Israel was scattered, they would be regathered; once the Gentiles had received the fullness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants of Israel, would be brought back in or come to know their true Messiah, their Lord and Redeemer.
In this way, my father prophesied and instructed my brothers, sharing many other things that I haven't written in this book, as I have included only what I felt was important in my other writings.
All these events took place while my father was living in a tent in the valley of Lemuel.
After hearing all my father's words about what he envisioned and what he spoke by the power of the Holy Ghost—given to him through faith in the Son of God, who was the promised Messiah—I, Nephi, also wanted to see, hear, and understand all these things, through the Holy Ghost, which is a gift from God for everyone who sincerely seeks Him, both in the past and in the present.
For He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and the way is ready for everyone from the beginning of the world, as long as they repent and turn to Him.
Those who earnestly seek will find, and the mysteries of God will be revealed to them through the Holy Ghost, just as they have been in past times and will be in the future; thus, God's plan is an everlasting cycle.
Therefore, remember, O human, that all your actions will lead you to judgment.
If you have chosen to do wrong during your time of testing, then you will be found unclean before God’s judgment, and nothing unclean can live with God; therefore, you will be cast out forever.
The Holy Ghost has given me the authority to speak these things and not deny them.
