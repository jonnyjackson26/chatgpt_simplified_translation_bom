The Lord instructed me to create metal plates to write down the history of my people. On these plates, I recorded my father's accounts, our travels in the wilderness, his prophecies, and many of my own prophecies.
At the time I created these plates, I didn't realize I would be commanded to make them; thus, the record of my father's history, his ancestry, and most of our experiences in the wilderness are engraved on those original plates. Therefore, significant events that happened before I made these plates are detailed on those first plates.
After completing these plates as instructed, I, Nephi, received a directive to write the more essential and valuable parts of our ministry and prophecies on these plates; that which was recorded was meant for the guidance of my people who would inherit the land and for other wise purposes known to the Lord.
So, I created a record on the other plates, giving a more detailed account of the wars, conflicts, and the destruction of my people. I did this and instructed my people on what to do after I was gone, ensuring these plates would be passed down from one generation to the next, or from one prophet to another, until further instructions from the Lord.
I will provide an account of how I made these plates later; now, I will proceed as I have mentioned, doing this so that the more sacred information may be preserved for my people.
However, I only write on these plates if I believe the content to be sacred. If I make mistakes, others have done so in the past; I don’t mean to excuse myself based on others, but I acknowledge my weakness as a person.
Some people value things greatly, both physically and spiritually, while others disregard them completely. Indeed, they treat even the very God of Israel as insignificant; they do not listen to his guidance.
And behold, according to the angel's words, he will come six hundred years after my father left Jerusalem.
Because of their sins, people will see him as worthless; they will beat him, and he will endure it; they will strike him, and he will endure it. Yes, they will spit on him, and he will endure it, out of his love and patience for humanity.
The God of our ancestors, who led them out of Egypt and protected them in the wilderness—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—will, as foretold by the angel, willingly allow himself to be taken by evil men to be raised up, as Zenock prophesied, to be crucified, as Neum said, and to be buried, as Zenos described, which included a sign of three days of darkness that would signal his death to those living on the islands of the sea, especially those from the house of Israel.
For the prophet says: On that day, the Lord God will visit all of Israel's house; some will hear his voice, bringing great joy and salvation because of their righteousness, while others will experience his power through storms, fire, smoke, darkness, the earth splitting open, and mountains being lifted.
All these events will undoubtedly happen, according to the prophet Zenos. The earth will shake; and because of the earth’s groans, many rulers of the islands will be moved by God’s Spirit to cry: The God of nature suffers.
And about those in Jerusalem, the prophet says they will be punished by all people because they will crucify the God of Israel, turning their hearts away and rejecting signs, wonders, and God’s power and glory.
Because they reject him, the prophet declares, they will wander as they live in the flesh, and they will come to be a curse and a taunt, hated by all nations.
However, when the day comes that they no longer turn their hearts away from the Holy One of Israel, then God will remember the promises made to their ancestors.
Then he will remember the islands of the sea; yes, all the people of the house of Israel will be gathered, says the Lord, as the prophet Zenos predicted, from all corners of the earth.
Indeed, all the earth will witness the Lord’s salvation, says the prophet; every nation, group, language, and people will be blessed.
And I, Nephi, have written these things for my people, hoping to persuade them to remember the Lord, their Redeemer.
Thus, I address all of Israel's house, hoping they can receive these writings.
For behold, I have been deeply affected in spirit, even to the point of weakness, for those in Jerusalem; had the Lord not shown mercy in revealing these truths to me, like he did to the prophets of old, I too would have perished.
Indeed, he revealed all things about them to the ancient prophets, and he also showed many things about us; thus, we must understand these matters because they are written on the brass plates.
Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, taught my brothers these truths; I read many things from the brass plates to them to show them the Lord's deeds in ancient lands.
I read a lot from the books of Moses; however, to fully persuade them to trust in the Lord, their Redeemer, I also read from the writings of the prophet Isaiah; I connected all scriptures to our situation for our benefit and understanding.
So, I spoke to them, saying: Listen to the prophet's words, you who remain from Israel’s house, a branch that has been severed; hear the prophet’s words written for all of Israel's house and relate them to your lives, so you can have hope, just like your brothers from whom you have been separated, for this is how the prophet wrote.
