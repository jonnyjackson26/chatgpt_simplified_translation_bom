I returned to my father's tent after I, Nephi, was spiritually taken away and saw many things.
I saw my brothers arguing with each other about what our father had told them.
He spoke many important things, but they were difficult to understand unless someone asked the Lord for help; since their hearts were hard, they didn't seek the Lord as they should have.
I felt sad because of their stubbornness and because I knew what I had seen would inevitably happen due to the great wickedness among people.
I was overwhelmed by my suffering because I felt my troubles were great, especially because of the destruction of my people, whose downfall I had witnessed.
After I gained strength, I talked to my brothers to understand why they were fighting.
They told me they couldn't grasp our father's words about the natural branches of the olive tree and the Gentiles.
I asked them if they had asked the Lord about it.
They replied they had not because they felt the Lord had not revealed anything to them.
I said to them: Why don’t you follow the Lord’s commandments? How can you expect to survive with hardened hearts?
Do you not remember what the Lord has said? If you do not harden your hearts and pray to me in faith, believing you will receive, and are diligent in keeping my commandments, these things will be made known to you.
I told them that the Lord’s Spirit likened the house of Israel to an olive tree; are we not part of Israel, as branches of this olive tree?
What our father meant by the natural branches being grafted back in through the fullness of the Gentiles is that in the last days, after many generations when our descendants have lost faith, the fullness of the gospel of the Messiah will come to the Gentiles and from them to the remnant of our people.
At that time, our descendants will realize they are part of the house of Israel and the Lord’s chosen people; they will then learn about their ancestors and the gospel of their Redeemer, which was preached to their forefathers by Him, so they will know how to reach Him and be saved.
Then, will they not rejoice and praise their eternal God, their rock and their salvation? Yes, in that day, will they not draw strength and nourishment from the true vine, and will they not return to God’s true fold?
Indeed, I tell you, they will be remembered again among the house of Israel; they will be grafted back as natural branches into the true olive tree.
This is what our father meant; he indicated that this would occur only after they were scattered among the Gentiles; it will come through the Gentiles so that the Lord can demonstrate His power, especially since He will be rejected by the Jews, the house of Israel.
Therefore, our father spoke not only of our descendants but of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant that will be fulfilled in the last days; this is the covenant the Lord made with our father Abraham, saying: Through your descendants, all nations of the earth will be blessed.
I talked to them at length about these matters; yes, I told them about the restoration of the Jews in the last days.
I recounted the words of Isaiah, who spoke about the restoration of the Jews, saying that they would not be confused or scattered again after that. Eventually, my words calmed them, and they humbled themselves before the Lord.
Then they asked me again: What does the dream our father had mean? What does the tree symbolize?
I replied: It represents the tree of life.
They asked me: What does the iron rod mean that our father saw leading to the tree?
I told them it represents the word of God; whoever listens to the word of God and holds on to it will never perish or fall to temptations and the fiery darts of the enemy, leading them to destruction.
So, I, Nephi, urged them to pay attention to the word of the Lord; I encouragement them with all my heart and soul to remember to always keep His commandments.
They then asked me: What does the river of water represent that our father saw?
I explained that the water represented filth, and our father's mind was so consumed with other things that he didn't see the filthiness of the water.
I told them that this water symbolized a terrible separation, keeping the wicked from the tree of life and from the saints of God.
I said to them that it also represented the awful hell, which an angel told me was prepared for the wicked.
I mentioned that our father saw how God’s justice did separate the wicked from the righteous, and its brightness was like a flame that rises up to God forever without end.
They asked me: Does this refer to the suffering of the body during life, or does it refer to the final condition of the soul after death, or does it address temporary things?
I explained that it represents both temporary and spiritual matters; the day will come when they will be judged for their actions, including those done by their physical body during life.
Therefore, if they die in their wickedness, they will also be rejected in terms of spiritual matters relating to righteousness; thus, they must stand before God to be judged based on their actions. If their actions have been filthy, they will be filthy; and if they are filthy, they cannot dwell in God's kingdom; otherwise, God’s kingdom would also have to be filthy.
But I assure you, God's kingdom is not filthy, and nothing unclean can enter it; therefore, there must be a place for the filthy.
And there is indeed a place prepared, namely that terrible hell I spoke of, and Satan is the one who prepares it; thus, the ultimate fate of souls is to dwell in God's kingdom or to be cast out according to the justice I described.
Therefore, the wicked are separated from the righteous and also from the tree of life, whose fruit is the most precious and desirable of all; indeed, it is the greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spoke to my brothers. Amen.
