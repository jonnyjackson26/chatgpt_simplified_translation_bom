Listen closely, O house of Jacob, called by the name of Israel, who have emerged from the waters of Judah, or from the waters of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord and mention the God of Israel, but they do not swear truthfully or righteously.
Even though they call themselves from the holy city, they do not rely on the God of Israel, who is the Lord of Hosts; indeed, that is his name.
Look, I have announced the previous events from the beginning; they came out of my mouth, and I revealed them. I made them known quickly.
I did this because I knew you are stubborn, with a neck as hard as iron and your forehead like brass.
From the beginning, I have declared these things to you; before they happened, I showed them to you; I revealed them so that you wouldn’t claim that your idol brought them about, or that your graven image or molten image commanded them.
You have seen and heard all of this; will you not proclaim it? And I have shown you new things that were hidden until now, things you did not know.
They exist now, not from the beginning; even before the day when you did not hear them, I announced them to you, so you would not say, "Look, I already knew about them."
Indeed, you did not hear them; indeed, you did not understand; your ears were not open at that time because I knew you would be very untrustworthy and were called a transgressor from birth.
However, for the sake of my name, I will delay my anger, and for my praise, I will hold back from you, so I do not cut you off.
Look, I have refined you; I have chosen you in the furnace of suffering.
For my own sake, yes, for my own sake, I will do this because I will not allow my name to be dishonored, and I will not give my glory to another.
Listen, O Jacob, and Israel whom I have chosen, for I am he; I am the first, and I am also the last.
My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has measured the heavens. I call to them, and they come together.
All of you, gather together and listen; who among them has revealed these things to them? The Lord has loved him; yes, and he will fulfill the word he has declared through them; and he will do what he wishes against Babylon, and his power will come upon the Chaldeans.
Also, says the Lord; I the Lord, yes, I have spoken; yes, I have called him to declare, I have brought him, and he will succeed.
Come close to me; I have not spoken in secret; from the beginning, when it was announced, I have spoken; and the Lord God, along with his Spirit, has sent me.
Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I have sent him, the Lord your God who teaches you how to gain from it, who guides you along the path you should walk, has done it.
Oh, if only you had listened to my commandments—your peace would have been like a flowing river, and your righteousness would have been like the waves of the sea.
Your descendants would have been like the sand, your offspring like the gravel; their name would not have been cut off or destroyed in my presence.
Leave Babylon, escape from the Chaldeans, and with joyful voices, proclaim this, declare it to the ends of the earth; say: The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob.
And they did not thirst; he led them through the desert; he made the waters flow from the rock for them; he split the rock, and the waters gushed out.
And despite all that he has done, and even greater things, the Lord says there is no peace for the wicked.
