After we had come down into the wilderness to see our father, he was very happy, and my mother, Sariah, was extremely glad because she had truly been worrying about us.
She thought we had died in the wilderness; she also complained to my father, saying that he was a dreamer. She said: Look, you have taken us away from our home, and now my sons are gone and we are dying out here.
This is how my mother complained to my father.
Then my father spoke to her, saying: I understand I am a dreamer; if I hadn’t seen God’s things in a vision, I wouldn’t have known how good He is, and would have stayed in Jerusalem, where I would have died with my people.
But look, I have been given a promised land, and I am happy about it; indeed, I know that the Lord will save my sons from Laban and bring them back to us in the wilderness.
This was how my father, Lehi, comforted my mother, Sariah, while we traveled in the wilderness toward the land of Jerusalem to get the record of the Jews.
When we got back to our father’s tent, their happiness was complete, and my mother felt much better.
She said: Now I am certain that the Lord told my husband to escape into the wilderness; yes, I am sure that the Lord protected my sons and saved them from Laban, and gave them strength to do what He commanded them. That’s how she spoke.
And then they rejoiced greatly, offering sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord, and they thanked the God of Israel.
After they had thanked the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records engraved on the brass plates and began to read them from the start.
He saw that they contained the five books of Moses, which tell the story of the creation of the world, as well as the story of Adam and Eve, our first parents.
They also included a record of the Jews from the beginning all the way to the start of Zedekiah’s reign, king of Judah.
They also had the prophecies of the holy prophets from the beginning down to Zedekiah’s reign; many of those prophecies were spoken by Jeremiah.
Then my father, Lehi, also found a family tree of his ancestors on the brass plates; thus, he knew he was a descendant of Joseph, the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt and preserved by God’s hand so he could save his father, Jacob, and all his family from starving.
And they were also led out of slavery and out of Egypt by that same God who had kept them safe.
Thus, my father, Lehi, discovered his family lineage. Laban was also a descendant of Joseph, so he and his ancestors kept the records.
Now, when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit and began to prophesy about his descendants—
That these brass plates would be shared with all nations, kindreds, languages, and peoples of his descendants.
He said that these brass plates would never be destroyed nor faded by time. He prophesied many things concerning his descendants.
So far, my father and I have followed the commandments the Lord gave us.
We have obtained the records that the Lord commanded us to get, examined them, and found them valuable; truly, they are of great worth to us because we could pass down God’s commandments to our children.
Therefore, it was wise of the Lord for us to take them with us as we traveled in the wilderness toward the promised land.
