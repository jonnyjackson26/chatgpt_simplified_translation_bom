I, Omni, was instructed by my father, Jarom, to write something on these plates to keep track of our family history.
During my time, I fought hard with the sword to protect my people, the Nephites, from their enemies, the Lamanites. However, I admit that I am a bad person and haven't followed God's commandments as I should have.
After two hundred seventy-six years, we experienced both peace and many bloody wars. In total, two hundred eighty-two years went by, and I kept these records as my fathers commanded, then passed them to my son Amaron. This is the end of my record.
Now, I, Amaron, will write down a few things in my father's book.
After three hundred twenty years, most of the wicked Nephites were destroyed.
The Lord didn’t allow this to happen without a reason, for He had led them out of Jerusalem and protected them from their enemies. He fulfilled His warning to our ancestors, saying that if they disobeyed Him, they would not thrive in the land.
So, the Lord judged them harshly; however, He spared the righteous to save them from destruction and delivered them from their foes.
I then handed the records to my brother Chemish.
Now, I, Chemish, will write down a few things in the same book as my brother; I saw his last writing, which was done by his own hand, the same day he gave them to me. This is how we maintain the records, following our fathers' commands. I conclude my record.
I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish. I witnessed a lot of wars and conflicts between my people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites. With my own sword, I defended my people and killed many Lamanites.
The records of our people are inscribed on plates kept by the kings through the generations, and I know of no new revelations or prophecies that haven't been written down, so what is enough has been recorded. This is the end of my record.
I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom. I will share some information about Mosiah, who became king of Zarahemla. He was warned by the Lord to escape from the land of Nephi, and many who listened to God's call also left with him into the wilderness.
They followed God's instructions and left the land for the wilderness, guided by teachings and prophecies. They were continually reminded by God's word and were led safely through the wilderness until they arrived in Zarahemla.
There, they encountered a group of people known as the people of Zarahemla. There was much joy among the people of Zarahemla when they realized that Mosiah arrived with the brass plates containing the records of the Jews.
Mosiah discovered that the people of Zarahemla had come from Jerusalem during the captivity of Zedekiah, the king of Judah.
They traveled through the wilderness and were guided by the Lord to cross great waters to the land where Mosiah found them, and they had lived there ever since.
By the time Mosiah found them, they had grown very numerous. However, they had experienced many wars and conflicts and had often been killed in battle. Their language had become mixed up, and they had brought no records with them. They did not even believe in their Creator, making it difficult for Mosiah and his people to understand them.
But Mosiah made sure they learned his language. After they learned it, Zarahemla shared a genealogy of his ancestors from memory, which was written down but not in these plates.
The people of Zarahemla and Mosiah joined together, and Mosiah was made their king.
During Mosiah’s reign, a notable stone with engravings was brought to him, which he interpreted through God's gift and power.
The engravings told the story of a man named Coriantumr and the deaths of his people. Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla and lived with them for nine months.
The engravings also spoke briefly about his ancestors, whose first parents came from a tower when the Lord confused the languages of the people, and God's judgment came upon them. Their remains lay scattered in the northern land.
I, Amaleki, was born during Mosiah's reign and have lived to see his death; now his son Benjamin reigns in his place.
In Benjamin's time, I have seen major wars and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites. Yet, the Nephites gained significant victories over them, to the point that King Benjamin pushed them out of Zarahemla.
As I grew old and had no children, I knew King Benjamin was a just man. Therefore, I will give these plates to him, urging all to turn to God, the Holy One of Israel, and have faith in prophecies, revelations, ministering angels, the gift of tongues, language interpretation, and all things good, for truly, all good comes from the Lord, while evil comes from the devil.
Now, dear brothers, I invite you to come to Christ, the Holy One of Israel, and accept His salvation and redemptive power. Yes, turn to Him and offer your entire selves as a sacrifice to Him, continue fasting and praying, and hold out until the end; as surely as the Lord lives, you will be saved.
Now, I would like to mention a group of people who went into the wilderness seeking to return to the land of Nephi, as many wanted to reclaim their inheritance.
So they went into the wilderness. Their leader was a strong and stubborn man, which led to conflict among them; out of the entire group, only fifty survived and returned to Zarahemla.
They also took others with them who returned to the wilderness.
I, Amaleki, had a brother who went with them, and I have not heard of them since. I am nearing my death, and the plates are now full. This is the end of my words.
