After I, Nephi, finished teaching my brothers, our father, Lehi, also spoke many things to them and reminded them of the great things the Lord had done for them by bringing them out of Jerusalem.
He talked to them about their rebellions on the sea and how God showed them mercy by saving their lives, ensuring they weren’t swallowed up by the ocean.
He also discussed the promised land they had received—how merciful the Lord had been to warn us to escape from Jerusalem.
He said, "Look, I have seen a vision showing that Jerusalem is destroyed; if we had stayed there, we would have perished too."
But he added, despite our struggles, we have received a promised land, one that is better than all others; a land that the Lord God has promised me will be for my descendants. Yes, the Lord has given this land to me and to my children forever, along with all those who are led here from other countries by His hand.
Therefore, I, Lehi, prophesy based on the inspiration I feel inside me that no one will come to this land unless they are guided here by the hand of the Lord.
Thus, this land is dedicated to those whom He brings here. If they serve Him according to His commandments, it will be a land of freedom for them; they will never be taken captive unless they commit wrongdoing. If sin is prevalent, the land will become cursed for their sake, but for the righteous, it will be blessed forever.
And indeed, it is wise that this land remains unknown to other nations; many nations would overrun it and leave no space for inheritance.
For I, Lehi, have been given a promise that as long as those whom the Lord brings from Jerusalem keep His commandments, they will thrive in this land; they will be protected from other nations so they can possess this land for themselves. If they keep His commandments, they will be blessed in this land, and no one will harm them or seize their inheritance; they shall live safely forever.
But when the time comes that they fall into disbelief, after receiving so many blessings from the Lord—knowing about the creation of the earth and mankind, aware of the marvelous works of the Lord since the beginning; given power through faith to do anything; having received all the commandments, and being brought by His infinite goodness into this precious promised land—if the day comes when they reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah, their Redeemer and God, then the just judgments of God will rest upon them.
Yes, He will bring other nations against them, give them power, take away their lands, and cause them to be scattered and afflicted.
Yes, as one generation passes to another, there will be bloodshed and severe punishments among them; therefore, my sons, I wish you would remember; I hope you will listen to my words.
Oh that you would awake; awaken from a deep sleep, even from the torment of hell, and shake off the terrible chains that bind you, which lead men to be captured and suffer eternal misery.
Awake! Arise from the dust, and hear the words of a concerned parent whose life you must soon lay to rest in the cold, silent grave, from which no traveler returns; just a few more days, and I will follow the path of all mortals.
But behold, the Lord has saved my soul from hell; I have seen His glory, and I am forever surrounded by His love.
And I wish for you to remember to follow the laws and commandments of the Lord; this has been my deepest concern since the beginning.
My heart has been burdened with sorrow from time to time, because I fear that due to your stubbornness, the Lord your God may come out with His full wrath against you, cutting you off and destroying you forever;
Or that a curse could fall upon you for many generations; you could suffer from swords, famine, hatred, and be led according to the will of the devil into captivity.
Oh my sons, may these things not happen to you, but instead, may you be a chosen and favored people of the Lord. However, may His will be done; for His paths are always right.
And He has said that if you keep My commandments, you will thrive in the land; but if you do not keep them, you will be cut off from My presence.
And now, so my soul may rejoice in you, and my heart may leave this world with happiness because of you, and I may not be overwhelmed by grief and sorrow in the grave, arise from the dust, my sons, be strong, and be united in mind and heart, so that you will not fall into bondage;
So you will not be cursed with a dreadful curse and not incur the anger of a just God upon you, leading to the destruction of both body and soul.
Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains that hold you, and come forth from obscurity, and rise from the dust.
Do not rebel against your brother, whose opinions have been wonderful, who has followed the commandments since we left Jerusalem, and who has been an instrument in God's hands in bringing us to this promised land; for if not for him, we would have starved in the wilderness; yet you sought to take his life; and he has suffered greatly because of you.
I am extremely afraid and tremble for you, lest he suffer once again; for see, you have accused him of seeking power and authority over you; but I know he does not seek power or authority over you; he seeks the glory of God and your own eternal wellbeing.
You have complained because he has been straightforward with you. You say he has been harsh; you claim he has been angry with you; but behold, his sharpness was the strength of God’s words within him; and what you call anger was simply the truth, according to what is in God, which he could not suppress, speaking boldly about your wrongdoings.
It must be that God's power must be with him, even in commanding you to obey. But it is not him, rather, it is the Spirit of the Lord in him, which opens his mouth with words he cannot restrain.
And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, as well as my sons who are the sons of Ishmael, listen: if you will hear Nephi's voice, you will not perish. And if you listen to him, I leave you a blessing, yes, even my highest blessing.
But if you do not listen to him, I will take back my highest blessing, yes, my blessing, and it shall rest upon him.
And now, Zoram, I speak to you: Behold, you are Laban's servant; nevertheless, you have been brought from Jerusalem, and I know you are a true friend to my son, Nephi, forever.
Thus, because you have been faithful, your descendants will be blessed with his descendants, that they may live in prosperity for a long time in this land; and nothing, unless there is wrongdoing among them, will harm or disrupt their prosperity in this land forever.
Therefore, if you keep the Lord's commandments, the Lord has designated this land for the safety of your descendants along with my son's descendants.
