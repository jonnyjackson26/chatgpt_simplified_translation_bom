I will sing a song to my beloved about his vineyard. My beloved has a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
He fenced it in, cleared out the stones, planted it with the best vines, built a tower in the middle, and made a winepress; he expected it to produce grapes, but it gave wild grapes instead.
Now, residents of Jerusalem and people of Judah, I ask you to judge between me and my vineyard.
What more could I have done for my vineyard that I haven’t done? So when I expected it to produce grapes and it produced wild grapes instead, what went wrong?
Now listen; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard—I will remove its protective hedge so that it can be destroyed, and I will break down its wall so it can be trampled.
I will let it lie in waste; it won’t be pruned or cultivated, and briars and thorns will grow up instead; I will also command the clouds not to rain on it.
The vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel, and the people of Judah are his delightful plants; he looked for justice, but only found oppression; he sought righteousness, but instead heard cries of distress.
Woe to those who pile house upon house, until there’s no room left and they are alone in the land!
The Lord of Hosts has told me that many houses will be left desolate, and large and beautiful cities will have no inhabitants.
Indeed, ten acres of vineyard will only produce a small amount of wine, and a measure of seed will yield very little.
Woe to those who get up early in the morning to drink strong alcohol and keep drinking late into the night until they are inflamed with wine!
Their feasts are filled with harps, lyres, tambourines, and wine, but they do not see what the Lord is doing or consider what he is capable of.
As a result, my people have gone into exile because they lack knowledge; their honorable men are starving, and the masses are parched with thirst.
Therefore, hell has expanded its grasp and opened its mouth endlessly; their glory, multitude, and joy will descend into it.
The common person will be brought low, the powerful humbled, and the proud will be brought down.
But the Lord of Hosts will be exalted in justice, and the Holy God will be honored in righteousness.
Then the lambs will graze as usual, and strangers will eat in the desolate areas where the fat cattle used to feed.
Woe to those who tether sin with ropes of emptiness, and draw iniquity as if it were a cartload;
Who say: Let him hurry and perform his work, so we can see it; let the will of the Holy One of Israel come quickly, so we can acknowledge it.
Woe to those who view evil as good, and good as evil; who turn darkness into light, and light into darkness; who see bitter as sweet, and sweet as bitter!
Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own estimation!
Woe to those who are mighty in drinking wine, and strong men who mix strong drinks;
Who justify the wicked for money, and take away the rights of the righteous!
Therefore, just as fire consumes stubble, and flames consume chaff, their roots will rot, and their blossoms will blow away like dust; because they have rejected the law of the Lord of Hosts, and disregarded the word of the Holy One of Israel.
As a result, the Lord's anger has been stirred against his people; he has reached out his hand against them and struck them; the hills shook, and their bodies lay torn in the streets. Despite all this, his anger is not yet turned away, and his hand is still stretched out.
He will raise a banner for distant nations, and call them from the far ends of the earth; and they will come swiftly, with no one weary or stumbling along the way.
None will sleep or slumber; neither will their belts be loosened, nor the laces of their shoes be broken.
Their arrows will be sharp, and their bows will be drawn; their horses' hooves will be as hard as flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind, their roaring will be like that of a lion.
They will roar like young lions; they will roar and seize their prey, carrying it off without anyone being able to rescue it.
On that day, they will roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and if they look toward the land, they will see darkness and anguish, with the heavens darkened above.
