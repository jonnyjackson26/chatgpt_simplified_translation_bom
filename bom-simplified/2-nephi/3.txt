Joseph in Egypt had a vision of the Nephites—He predicted the coming of Joseph Smith, a prophet of the latter days; of Moses, who would free Israel; and the appearance of the Book of Mormon. About 588–570 B.C.
Now I speak to you, Joseph, my youngest son. You were born during a time of great hardship for me; yes, your mother brought you into the world during my deepest sorrow.
May the Lord also dedicate this land to you, a very valuable land for your inheritance and that of your descendants, alongside your brothers, for your forever security, if you and your descendants keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.
And now, Joseph, my youngest son, whom I have brought out of my wilderness of struggles, may the Lord bless you always, for your offspring will not be completely destroyed.
For you are a part of my family; and I am a descendant of Joseph who was taken captive in Egypt. And the promises made to Joseph by the Lord were significant.
So, Joseph truly foresaw our time. He received a promise from the Lord that from his lineage, the Lord would raise up a righteous person for the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch that would be separated, yet remembered in the Lord's covenants, so that the Messiah would be revealed to them in the last days, bringing them from darkness to light—yes, from hidden darkness and slavery to freedom.
For Joseph truly testified, saying: The Lord my God will raise up a seer who will be a special prophet from my descendants.
Yes, Joseph truly declared: The Lord said to me: I will raise up a special seer from your family, and he will be highly regarded among your descendants. To him, I will command to do a great work for your family, which will be very valuable to them, bringing them to the understanding of the covenants I made with your ancestors.
And I will command him to do nothing but what I instruct him to do. And I will make him important in my eyes; for he will accomplish my work.
And he will be great like Moses, whom I said I would raise up for you to free my people, O house of Israel.
And I will raise up Moses, to deliver your people from Egypt.
But a seer will I raise up from your lineage; to him, I will give the power to bring forth my word to your descendants—and not just to bring forth my word, says the Lord, but to convince them of my word, which will already have been shared among them.
Therefore, your descendants will write; and the descendants of Judah will write; and the writings from your descendants, along with those from the descendants of Judah, will come together, causing confusion for false beliefs, settling disputes, bringing peace among your descendants, and leading them to remember their ancestors in the last days, and also to understand my covenants, says the Lord.
And out of weakness, he will gain strength on the day when my work begins among all my people, to restore you, O house of Israel, says the Lord.
And so Joseph prophesied, saying: Look, that seer will be blessed by the Lord; and those who try to harm him will be confused; for this promise I received from the Lord about my descendants will come true. Look, I am confident about the fulfillment of this promise;
And his name will be after mine; and it will be after his father's name. He will be like me; because what the Lord will bring forth through him will lead my people to salvation by the power of the Lord.
Indeed, thus Joseph prophesied: I am certain about this matter, just as I am certain about the promise given to Moses; for the Lord has said to me, I will preserve your lineage forever.
And the Lord has also said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will give him power with a rod; and I will provide him with written judgments. Yet, I will not loosen his tongue, so he will not speak much, for I will not make him powerful in speech. But I will write my law to him with my own hand; and I will provide him a spokesperson.
And the Lord also said to me: I will raise up someone from your descendants; and I will provide him a spokesperson. And behold, I will have him write the words for his genealogy, to his descendants; and the spokesperson for your descendants will announce them.
The words that he will write will be what I consider necessary to go forth to your descendants. And it will be as if your descendants had called out to them from the dust; for I know their faith.
And they will call from the dust; yes, even asking for repentance for their brothers, even after many generations have passed. And it will happen that their calling will resonate, even in simple words.
Because of their faith, their words will come forth from my mouth to their brothers who are your descendants; and I will strengthen their weak words in their faith, reminding them of my covenant made with your ancestors.
And now, behold, my son Joseph, in this way did my father of old prophesy.
Therefore, because of this covenant, you are blessed; for your descendants will not be destroyed, for they will listen to the words of the book.
And there will arise a mighty one among them, who will do much good in both word and deed, serving as an instrument in God’s hands, with great faith, to perform mighty miracles, and accomplish great things in God’s sight, to bring about much restoration to the house of Israel and your brothers’ descendants.
And now, blessed are you, Joseph. Behold, you are small; so listen to the words of your brother, Nephi, and it will be done to you according to the words I have spoken. Remember the words of your dying father. Amen.
