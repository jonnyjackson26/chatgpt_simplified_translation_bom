Woe to those who make unjust laws and write burdensome regulations that they enforce; 
To deprive the needy of justice and to deny the rights of the poor in my community, allowing widows to be exploited, and children without fathers to be taken advantage of!
What will you do when the time of reckoning arrives, and destruction comes from afar? Who will you turn to for help, and where will you go to protect your status?
Without Me, you will bow down under oppression, and you will fall among the slain. Even after all this, My anger remains, and My hand is still raised against you.
O Assyrian, you are the tool of My anger, and your leaders carry out My indignation.
I will send him against a deceitful nation, and I will charge him to plunder the people I am angry with, to conquer them as easily as walking through the mud in the streets.
However, he does not understand this; he does not consider that his heart's true intention is to destroy and eliminate many nations.
For he says: Are not my leaders all kings?
Is Calno not like Carchemish? Is Hamath not like Arpad? Is Samaria not like Damascus?
Just as I have established the nations that worship idols and whose images are greater than those of Jerusalem and Samaria;
Will I not do to Jerusalem and her idols what I have done to Samaria and her idols?
So it will happen that when the Lord has completed all His work on Mount Zion and Jerusalem, I will punish the pride of the Assyrian king and the arrogance of his lofty appearance.
For he boasts: By my own strength and wisdom, I have accomplished these things; I am wise; I have changed the borders of nations, taken their treasures, and put down their inhabitants like a strong warrior;
And I have gathered the riches of the people just like collecting eggs left in a nest; I have gathered everything from the earth, and no one has even flapped a wing or spoken.
Can a tool boast against the person using it? Can a saw brag against the one who shakes it? It’s as silly as a rod shaking itself in the hands of its user or a staff lifting itself as if it were not just a piece of wood!
Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, will send among his fat and comfortable ones, emptiness; and He will ignite a fire beneath His glory like a raging flame.
And the light of Israel will be a fire, and His Holy One will be a flame, consuming thorns and thistles in just one day;
He will destroy the glory of His forest and the fruitful fields, both body and soul; it will be as if a standard-bearer has fainted.
The remaining trees in His forest will be so few that a child could count them.
On that day, the remnant of Israel and the survivors from the house of Jacob will no longer rely on the Assyrian who struck them, but they will trust in the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, genuinely.
The remnant will return, yes, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
For even if your people Israel are as numerous as the sand on the seashore, only a remnant will return; the destruction declared will be overwhelmed by righteousness.
For the Lord God of Hosts will bring about a determined destruction across all the land.
Therefore, the Lord God of Hosts says: O My people who dwell in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrian; he will attack you with a rod and lift his staff against you, just like in Egypt.
For it won’t be long until My anger subsides and My wrath is satisfied in their destruction.
And the Lord of Hosts will stir up a whip against him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; just as My rod was over the sea, so shall it be lifted again like in Egypt.
And on that day, his burden will be removed from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; the yoke will be broken because of the power of the anointing.
He has come to Aiath, he has passed through Migron; at Michmash, he has put down his bags.
They have crossed over to the next region; they are spending the night at Geba; Ramath is afraid, and Gibeah of Saul is fleeing.
Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim; let it be heard all the way to Laish, O poor Anathoth.
Madmenah has been moved; the people of Gebim gather to escape.
Even now he remains at Nob; he shakes his hand towards the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
Behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts will cut down trees with fear; the tall and mighty will be hewn down, and the proud will be humbled.
He will chop down the thick woods with iron tools, and Lebanon will fall at the hands of a mighty warrior.
