After Christ rises from the dead, he will reveal himself to you, my children, and my dear brothers; the words he will say to you will be the commandments you should follow.
I tell you that I have seen many generations pass away, and there will be many wars and disagreements among my people.
After the Messiah arrives, signs will be given to my people about his birth, death, and resurrection; that day will be terrible for the wicked, as they will be destroyed for rejecting the prophets and saints, as well as murdering them; therefore, the cries of the blood of the saints will rise to God from the ground against them.
So, all who are proud and do evil will be burned on the day that comes, says the Lord of Hosts, for they will be like dried stubble.
Those who kill the prophets and saints will be swallowed up by the earth, says the Lord of Hosts; mountains will cover them, and storms will carry them away, buildings will collapse on them, crushing them into dust.
They will face thunders, lightning, earthquakes, and many forms of destruction, for the fire of God's anger will be kindled against them, and they will be like stubble; that day will consume them, says the Lord of Hosts.
Oh, the sorrow and pain in my heart for the loss of my people! I, Nephi, have seen it, and it nearly overwhelms me before the Lord’s presence; yet I must call on my God: Your ways are just.
But behold, the righteous who listen to the prophets’ words and do not harm them, but steadfastly look to Christ for the signs given, despite all persecution—they are the ones who will not be destroyed.
The Son of Righteousness will come to them; he will heal them, and they will find peace with him, until three generations have passed by, and many from the fourth generation will have lived righteously.
When these times have passed, a swift destruction will come upon my people; for despite the pains in my soul, I have seen it; therefore, I know it will happen; and they sell themselves for nothing; for the reward of their pride and foolishness will be their destruction; because they give in to the devil and choose darkness over light, they will end up in hell.
The Lord’s Spirit will not always contend with humanity. When the Spirit stops striving with people, swift destruction comes, which grieves my soul.
As I spoke about convincing the Jews that Jesus is truly the Christ, it is also essential that the Gentiles be convinced that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God.
He reveals himself to all who believe in him, through the power of the Holy Ghost; indeed, to every nation, family, language, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders among mankind according to their faith.
But behold, I prophesy to you about the last days, concerning when the Lord God will reveal these things to humanity.
After my descendants and my brothers' descendants have fallen into disbelief and have been struck down by the Gentiles; yes, after the Lord God has surrounded them and laid siege against them, and raised fortifications against them; even after they have been brought low, such that they are not, the words of the righteous will still be written and the prayers of the faithful will be heard; those who have strayed in disbelief will not be forgotten.
The destroyed ones will speak to them from the ground, their voices will be faint from the dust, like one who has a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give him the power to whisper concerning them, as if it were from the ground; their words will softly rise from the dust.
Thus says the Lord God: They will write down the events that will unfold among them, and they will be written and sealed in a book, which those who have fallen into disbelief will not have, for they seek to destroy the things of God.
Therefore, just as those who have been destroyed were swiftly lost, and the multitude of their fierce ones will be like chaff that disappears—yes, thus says the Lord God: It will happen suddenly, in an instant—
And it will be that those who have strayed in disbelief will be struck down by the Gentiles.
The Gentiles are puffed up with pride and have stumbled because of their many errors, having built many churches; yet they cast aside the power and miracles of God, preaching their own wisdom and learning to gain wealth and exploit the poor.
Many churches have been built that cause envy, strife, and malice.
There are also secret combinations, just like in ancient times, according to the devil's schemes, for he is the founder of all these things; yes, the originator of murder and dark deeds; he leads them along with a weak cord until he binds them in strong cords forever.
For behold, my dear brothers, I say to you that the Lord God does not work in darkness.
He does nothing unless it benefits the world; for he loves the world, so much that he gave his own life to draw all people to him. Therefore, he does not command anyone to refrain from his salvation.
Does he call out to anyone, saying: Stay away from me? I say to you, no; instead, he says: Come to me, all you ends of the earth, buying milk and honey without money or price.
Has he commanded anyone to leave the synagogues or houses of worship? I say to you, no.
Has he commanded anyone not to accept his salvation? I say to you, no; rather, he offers it freely to all people, and he commands his followers to persuade others to repent.
Has the Lord asked anyone not to enjoy his goodness? I say to you, no; all men have the same privileges, and none are excluded.
He commands that there should be no priestcrafts; for priestcrafts involve people preaching and promoting themselves as examples for the world, seeking gain and praise rather than Zion's welfare.
The Lord has forbidden this; hence, the Lord God has commanded that everyone should have charity, which is love. Without charity, they are nothing. If they had charity, they would not let the laborers in Zion go hungry.
The laborers in Zion will work for Zion; if they work only for money, they will not survive. 
The Lord God has commanded that people must not murder, lie, steal, misuse the name of the Lord, feel envy, harbor malice, argue amongst each other, commit sexual immorality, or engage in any of these actions; for all who do these things will perish.
None of these wrongdoings come from the Lord; he does good among humanity; and he does nothing unless it is clear to the people; he invites everyone to come to him and receive his goodness; he excludes no one who comes to him, regardless of race or status, and he remembers the outcasts; all are valued the same by God, both Jew and Gentile.
