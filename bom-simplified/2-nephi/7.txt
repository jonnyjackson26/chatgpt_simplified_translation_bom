Yes, the Lord asks: Have I abandoned you or cast you away for good? Where is the proof that your mother was divorced? To whom have I sent you away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Truly, to whom have I sold you? Look, it’s because of your sins that you have sold yourselves, and your mother is put away because of your wrongdoings.
So, when I came, there was no one there; when I called, no one answered. O house of Israel, is my power so limited that I cannot save, or do I lack the ability to rescue? Look, with just a word from me, I can dry up the sea, turn their rivers into deserts, and make the fish stink because the waters are gone, leading them to die from thirst.
I cover the skies with darkness and make them as a shroud of mourning.
The Lord God has given me the ability to speak wisely, so that I can offer you the right words at the right time, O house of Israel. When you are tired, He wakes me up each morning and opens my ears to listen like a student.
The Lord God has opened my ears, and I did not resist or turn away.
I have offered my back to those who hit me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard. I did not hide my face from shame and insults.
The Lord God will assist me, so I will not be ashamed. Therefore, I have made my resolve strong, knowing I will not be humiliated.
And the Lord is close, and He will defend me. Who will argue with me? Let’s stand together. Who is my opponent? Let them approach, and I will confront them with my words.
For the Lord God will provide for me. And all those who accuse me will wear out like old clothes, and the moth will consume them.
Who among you fears the Lord and listens to His servant, yet walks in darkness without any light?
Look, all of you who start fires and surround yourselves with sparks, go ahead and walk in the light of your own fire and the sparks you have started. This is what you will receive from my hand—you will lie down in grief.
