Even so, the darkness will not be as severe as when he lightly troubled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and later caused greater distress along the path of the Red Sea beyond the Jordan in Galilee of the nations.
The people who were living in darkness have seen a bright light; those living in a place overshadowed by death have had the light shine upon them.
You have increased the nation and brought more joy to the people; they rejoice before you as when there is a successful harvest, and like soldiers celebrating their victory after a battle.
For you have removed the burden from their shoulders and the rod that oppressed them.
Every battle fought by warriors is filled with chaos and bloodstained clothing; but this will be different, filled with fire and light.
A child has been born for us, a son has been given to us; the authority will rest on his shoulders, and he will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
The growth of his authority and peace will have no end. He will sit on David’s throne, running his kingdom with fairness and justice from this time forward and forever. The passionate commitment of the Lord of Hosts will ensure this happens.
The Lord sent his message to Jacob, and it has reached Israel.
And everyone will know, including Ephraim and the people of Samaria, who speak with pride and stubborn hearts:
The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with cut stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will replace them with cedar trees.
As a result, the Lord will raise up enemies against Rezin and unite those who oppose him.
The Syrians will be on one side and the Philistines on the other; they will consume Israel greedily. Despite all this, his anger remains unappeased, and his hand is still stretched out.
The people do not turn to him who strikes them, nor do they seek the Lord of Hosts.
So the Lord will remove from Israel both the head and the tail, the tall and the low in one day.
The leaders are the head; and the lying prophets are the tail.
The leaders lead this people astray; those who follow them will be destroyed.
So the Lord will take no pleasure in their young people, nor will he show compassion to their orphans and widows; because every one of them is hypocritical and wicked, and every mouth speaks foolishness. In spite of all this, his anger remains unappeased, and his hand is still stretched out.
For wickedness burns like fire; it will consume the briars and thorns, and it will catch fire in the thickets of the forests, rising like smoke.
By the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, the land will be darkened, and the people will become like fuel for the fire; no one will spare their neighbor.
They will attack to the right and go hungry; they will eat to the left but still not be satisfied; every person will eat the flesh of their own arm—
Manasseh against Ephraim, and Ephraim against Manasseh; together they will stand against Judah. Despite all this, his anger remains unappeased, and his hand is still stretched out.
