In that future time, seven women will hold onto one man, saying: We will provide our own food and wear our own clothes; just let us be known by your name to remove our shame.
During that day, the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious; the bounty of the land will be excellent and appealing to those who have survived from Israel.
Those who remain in Zion and stay in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone whose name is written among the living in Jerusalemâ€”
When the Lord has purified the daughters of Zion and cleansed Jerusalem from sin through the spirit of judgment and the spirit of refinement.
The Lord will create a protective cloud over every home on Mount Zion and over her gatherings, providing smoke by day and the brightness of a flaming fire by night; for all the glory of Zion will serve as a shelter.
There will be a place to provide shade during the day from the heat and a refuge, shielding from storms and rain.
