IN THE MILLENNIAL DAY ALL MEN WILL PRAISE THE LORD—HE WILL DWELL AMONG THEM—COMPARE ISAIAH 12. ABOUT 559–545 B.C.





AND IN THAT DAY THOU SHALT SAY: O LORD, I WILL PRAISE THEE; THOUGH THOU WAST ANGRY WITH ME THINE ANGER IS TURNED AWAY, AND THOU COMFORTEDST ME.

BEHOLD, GOD IS MY SALVATION; I WILL TRUST, AND NOT BE AFRAID; FOR THE LORD JEHOVAH IS MY STRENGTH AND MY SONG; HE ALSO HAS BECOME MY SALVATION.

THEREFORE, WITH JOY SHALL YE DRAW WATER OUT OF THE WELLS OF SALVATION.

AND IN THAT DAY SHALL YE SAY: PRAISE THE LORD, CALL UPON HIS NAME, DECLARE HIS DOINGS AMONG THE PEOPLE, MAKE MENTION THAT HIS NAME IS EXALTED.

SING UNTO THE LORD; FOR HE HATH DONE EXCELLENT THINGS; THIS IS KNOWN IN ALL THE EARTH.

CRY OUT AND SHOUT, THOU INHABITANT OF ZION; FOR GREAT IS THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL IN THE MIDST OF THEE.
