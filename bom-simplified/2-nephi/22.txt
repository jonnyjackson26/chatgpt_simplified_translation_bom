In the time of peace, everyone will honor the Lord—He will be present among them—See Isaiah 12. About 559–545 B.C.
On that day, you will say: O Lord, I will thank you; even though you were angry with me, your anger has calmed down, and you have comforted me.
Look, God is my savior; I will trust in Him and not be scared; for the Lord is my strength and my song; He has also become my salvation.
So, with happiness, you will gather water from the springs of salvation.
And on that day, you will say: Praise the Lord, call on His name, tell the people about His great works, and mention that His name is supreme.
Sing to the Lord; for He has done wonderful things; this is known throughout the world.
Shout and rejoice, you people of Zion; for the Holy One of Israel is among you and is truly great.
