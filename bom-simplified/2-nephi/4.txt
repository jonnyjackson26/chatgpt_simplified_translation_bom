Now, I, Nephi, want to talk about the prophecies my father shared about Joseph, who was taken to Egypt.
He truly predicted things about all his descendants. There are not many prophecies greater than those he wrote. He also prophesied about us and our future generations, and these are recorded on the brass plates.
After my father finished discussing Joseph’s prophecies, he called the children of Laman—his sons and daughters—and addressed them: Listen to my words, my sons and daughters, who are the descendants of my firstborn.
The Lord God has said: If you keep my commandments, you will do well in the land; if you do not keep my commandments, you will be cut off from my presence.
But look, my sons and daughters, I can’t die without leaving you a blessing; I know that if you are raised in the right way, you will not stray from it.
So, if you are cursed, I leave my blessing with you, that the curse may be lifted from you and fall upon your parents instead.
Because of my blessing, the Lord God will not allow you to be destroyed; He will show mercy to you and your descendants forever.
After my father finished speaking to Laman’s children, he had Lemuel's children brought to him.
He spoke to them, saying: Look, my sons and daughters, who are the children of my second son; I give you the same blessing I gave the children of Laman; you will not be completely destroyed; ultimately, your descendants will be blessed.
Then my father spoke to the sons of Ishmael and all his family.
After he finished with them, he addressed Sam, saying: You are blessed, along with your descendants; you will inherit the land just like your brother Nephi. Your descendants will be counted with his; you will be like your brother, and your descendants be like his; you will be blessed all your days.
After my father, Lehi, had spoken to everyone in our family, as he felt in his heart and by the Spirit of the Lord within him, he grew old. Eventually, he died and was buried.
Not long after his death, Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael became angry with me because of the Lord's guidance.
I, Nephi, felt compelled to speak to them, as the Lord commanded; I had shared many things with them, as had my father before he passed away; many of those words are recorded on my other plates, which tell a more detailed history.
On these plates, I write about my soul and many of the scriptures found on the brass plates. I truly enjoy the scriptures; I reflect on them and record them for the education and benefit of my children.
My soul finds joy in the Lord’s things; I continually think about what I have seen and heard.
Despite the incredible goodness of the Lord in showing me His great and marvelous works, I lament: What a miserable person I am! I feel sorrow for my physical weaknesses; my soul grieves because of my wrongdoings.
I am surrounded by temptations and sins that easily ensnare me.
When I want to rejoice, my heart aches because of my sins; still, I know in whom I have faith.
My God has been my strength; He has guided me through challenges in the wilderness and has kept me safe on the vast waters.
He has filled me with His love, even to the point of overwhelming me.
He has confused my enemies so that they tremble before me.
He has heard my cries in the daytime and granted me understanding through visions at night.
During the day, I have been bold in prayer before Him; I have lifted my voice high, and angels have come down to help me.
By the power of His Spirit, I have been carried away to high mountains. I have seen incredible things, too great for man; therefore, I was told not to write them down.
If I have witnessed such great things, and if the Lord has shown so much mercy toward humanity, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in sorrow, and my body wear out and my strength wane because of my troubles?
Why should I give in to sin just because of my physical desires? Why let temptations take control of my heart and disrupt my peace and afflict my soul? Why should I feel anger because of my enemies?
Awake, my soul! Do not give in to sin any longer. Rejoice, my heart, and do not allow the enemy of my soul to have a place.
Do not let anger take hold because of my enemies. Do not weaken my strength due to my struggles.
Rejoice, my heart, and call out to the Lord, saying: O Lord, I will praise you forever; my soul will rejoice in you, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
O Lord, will you save my soul? Will you rescue me from my enemies’ grasp? Will you strengthen me to resist sin?
May the gates of hell be forever closed to me, for my heart is broken, and my spirit is humble! O Lord, do not close the gates of your righteousness before me, that I may walk the path of humility, clear and straight!
O Lord, wrap me in your robe of righteousness! O Lord, make a way for my escape from my enemies! Make my path clear before me! Do not let me stumble, but clear my way and obstruct my enemies instead.
O Lord, I trust in you and will continue to trust in you forever. I will not rely on human strength; I know that it is a curse to depend on the arm of flesh. Yes, it is a curse to trust in man or make flesh your support.
I know that God gives generously to those who ask. Yes, my God will give me what I need if I ask sincerely; therefore, I will lift my voice to you; I will cry out to you, my God, the rock of my righteousness. My voice will always rise up to you, my rock and eternal God. Amen.
