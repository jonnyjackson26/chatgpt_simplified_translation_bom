Jacob speaks to you again, my dear brothers, about this important branch I’ve mentioned.
Look, the promises we have received are meant for us physically; thus, I’ve seen that many of our children will suffer and even die because they don’t believe. However, God will show mercy to many, and our children will be restored so they can truly know their Savior.
Therefore, as I mentioned earlier, it is necessary that Christ—an angel revealed this name to me—should come to the Jews, who are among the most wicked in the world; and they will crucify Him because this is how it must happen with our God. No other nation on earth would do such a thing.
If great miracles were shown among other nations, they would repent and recognize Him as their God.
But because of corrupt practices and evil in Jerusalem, they will harden their hearts against Him, leading to His crucifixion.
Thus, due to their sins, terrible destruction, famine, plagues, and violence will come upon them; those who survive will be scattered among all nations.
But the Lord God says: When the time comes that they believe in me, acknowledging that I am Christ, I have promised their forefathers that they will be physically restored on earth to their rightful lands.
It will happen that they will be gathered back from their long exile, from far-off islands and every corner of the earth; and the Gentile nations will be significant in my eyes, says God, as they help bring them back to their lands.
Yes, the Gentile kings will be like nurturing fathers to them, and their queens will be like nurturing mothers; therefore, the Lord’s promises to the Gentiles are immense, for He has declared it, and who can argue against it?
But see, God has declared that this land will belong to you, and the Gentiles will find blessings here.
This land will be a place of freedom for the Gentiles, and there will be no kings ruling over them.
I will strengthen this land against all other nations.
And those who fight against Zion will face destruction, says God.
For anyone who raises a king against me will perish; I, the Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, shining my light on them forever for those who listen to my words.
Therefore, for this reason—so that the promises I have made to humanity may be fulfilled—I must intervene against the secret combinations of evil, murders, and wrongdoing.
So anyone who fights against Zion, whether Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male or female, will be destroyed; for they represent all that is wrong in the world; those who are not with me are against me, says our God.
For I will keep my promises made to humanity, doing for them while they are still alive—
So, my dear brothers, God says: I will allow your descendants to be harmed at the hands of the Gentiles; however, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles so they can be like fathers to them; therefore, the Gentiles will be blessed and counted among the house of Israel.
I will dedicate this land to your descendants and those who are counted among them forever, as it is a special land, says God above all others. I want everyone living here to worship me, says God.
And now, my dear brothers, knowing that our merciful God has granted us such great understanding, let’s remember Him, turn from our sins, and lift up our heads, for we have not been abandoned; even though we have been forced from our rightful home, we have been guided to a better place, with the sea as our pathway, and we are on an island.
But the Lord’s promises to those on the islands of the sea are great; the mention of islands indicates that there are more, and they too are inhabited by our kin.
For the Lord God has led away people from the house of Israel at different times, according to His will and desires. And now, the Lord remembers all who have been cut off, meaning He remembers us too.
So, lift your spirits and remember you have the freedom to make your own choices—to choose between everlasting suffering or eternal life.
Therefore, my dear brothers, align yourselves with God’s will, not with the will of evil and the desires of the flesh; and remember, once you are reconciled with God, it is only by His grace that you can be saved.
So may God bring you back to life through the power of resurrection, and save you from everlasting death through the atonement, allowing you to enter the eternal kingdom of God, so you can praise Him through divine grace. Amen.
