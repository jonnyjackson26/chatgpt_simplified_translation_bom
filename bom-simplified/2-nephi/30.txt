Look, my dear brothers, I want to share something important with you; I, Nephi, do not want you to think that you are more righteous than the Gentiles. Understand that if you do not keep God's commandments, you will all perish; and because of what has been said, don’t think that all Gentiles will be completely destroyed.
I tell you that all Gentiles who repent will become part of the Lord's covenant people; however, those Jews who refuse to repent will be rejected. The Lord makes a covenant only with those who turn to Him and believe in His Son, Jesus, who is the Holy One of Israel.
Now, I want to prophesy more about the Jews and the Gentiles. After the book I mentioned is published and written for the Gentiles, then sealed again to the Lord, many will believe what is written in it, and they will share this message with the remaining descendants of our people.
Then, the remaining descendants will learn about us, how we left Jerusalem, and that they are related to the Jews.
The gospel of Jesus Christ will be preached to them; thus, they will be restored to the understanding of their ancestors, as well as the knowledge of Jesus Christ that their ancestors had.
They will rejoice when they realize this is a blessing from God; their ignorance will start to disappear, and many generations will not pass without them being a pure and joyful people.
The scattered Jews will also begin to believe in Christ; they will start to gather together on the land, and all who believe in Christ will become a delightful people.
The Lord God will start His work among all nations, tribes, languages, and peoples to restore His people on earth.
With justice, the Lord God will judge the poor and fairly correct the humble. He will strike the earth with the power of His words; and with His breath, He will put an end to the wicked.
Soon, the Lord God will cause a significant separation among the people, destroying the wicked while saving His people, even if it means He must use fire against the wicked.
Righteousness will be like a belt around His waist, and faithfulness will be like a belt around His hips.
Then, the wolf will live peacefully with the lamb; the leopard will lie down with the young goat, and the calf, along with the young lion, will be together; and a little child will lead them.
The cow and the bear will graze together; their cubs will lie down side by side, and the lion will eat grass like an ox.
A nursing child will play near the snake’s hole, and a toddler will put his hand on the nest of a poisonous snake.
They will not harm or destroy anyone on my holy mountain; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord, just as the sea is filled with water.
Therefore, the matters of all nations will be made known; indeed, everything will be revealed to humanity.
There is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed; nothing done in darkness will remain unexposed in the light; and nothing sealed on earth will stay sealed.
Thus, everything revealed to humanity will be made known at that time; and for a long while, Satan will not have power over the hearts of people anymore. Now, my beloved brothers, I conclude my statements.
