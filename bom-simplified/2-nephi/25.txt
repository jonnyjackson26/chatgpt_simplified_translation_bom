I, Nephi, want to talk a bit about the things I have written that come from the words of Isaiah. Many of my people find Isaiah's words difficult to understand because they're unfamiliar with how the Jews prophesy.
I haven’t taught my people much about the ways of the Jews, since their actions were dark and their ways were wicked.
So, I write to my people and to anyone who might read this later, to help them understand God's judgments that come upon all nations, as He has said.
Listen, my people of Israel, and pay attention to my words; even if Isaiah's words aren't clear to you, they are clear to those who are inspired by prophecy. But I will share a prophecy of my own, in the straightforward way I have always done since I left Jerusalem with my father; my soul finds joy in simple words so my people can learn.
And yes, I take pleasure in Isaiah's words. I came from Jerusalem, I have seen what the Jews have seen, and I understand that they grasp the words of the prophets better than anyone else, unless others learn from them the way the Jews do.
However, I haven’t taught my children the same way the Jews do. I have lived in Jerusalem, so I know the surrounding areas; I have told my children about God's judgments on the Jews according to what Isaiah has said, but I don’t write those judgments here.
For now, I will continue with my own prophecy, which I know to be true; and in times to come, when Isaiah's prophecies happen, people will know for certain when they do.
These prophecies are valuable to humanity, and if anyone thinks they aren't, I will specifically address them and focus my words on my own people because I know that these words will mean a lot to them in the last days; they will understand them then, and that’s why I’ve written them.
Just as one generation of Jews has faced destruction due to their wickedness, they have been destroyed from one generation to the next for the same reasons; none have perished without warning from the prophets.
They were warned about their destruction immediately after my father left Jerusalem, but they hardened their hearts; as my prophecy declared, they were destroyed, except for those taken captive to Babylon.
I say this because of the spirit within me. Even though they have been taken captive, they will come back and reclaim Jerusalem; they will return to their land of inheritance.
However, they will experience wars and rumors of wars; when the day comes that God's only Son appears to them in person, they will reject Him because of their sins and stubborn hearts.
They will crucify Him, and after He is buried for three days, He will rise again, bringing healing; all who believe in His name will be saved in the kingdom of God. That’s why I find joy in prophesying about Him; I have seen His day, and my heart praises His holy name.
After the Messiah rises from the dead and shows Himself to those who believe, Jerusalem will face destruction again. Woe to those who fight against God and His followers.
Thus, the Jews will be scattered among all nations, and Babylon will also be destroyed, leading to the Jews being dispersed by other nations.
After being scattered and punished by other nations for many generations—until they believe in Christ, the Son of God, and His infinite atonement for all—it will be when they truly believe in Christ and worship God with pure hearts and clean hands that they will no longer look for another Messiah.
Then, the Lord will once again reach out to restore His people from their fallen state, performing a remarkable work among people.
He will present His words to them, which will judge them at the last day, intended to convince them of the true Messiah whom they rejected, convincing them that they do not need to wait for another Messiah, since only one true Messiah—who would be rejected by the Jews—has been foretold by the prophets.
The prophets stated that the Messiah would come exactly 600 years after my father left Jerusalem; according to this prophecy and an angel of God, His name will be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Now, my friends, I have spoken clearly in a way that you cannot misunderstand. Just as the Lord God lives and led Israel out of Egypt, giving Moses power to heal those bitten by poisonous snakes if they looked at the raised serpent, I say to you, as these things are real and the Lord lives, there is no other name under heaven by which people can be saved except for this Jesus Christ I’ve mentioned.
For this reason, the Lord God has promised me that these writings will be preserved and passed down through generations so that Joseph's line will not perish as long as the earth lasts.
These writings will continue through all time as long as the earth exists and will go according to God's will; the nations who have them will be judged based on the words written.
We work hard to write and urge our children and brothers to believe in Christ and to reconcile with God because we know we are saved by grace after all we can do.
Despite our belief in Christ, we follow the law of Moses and look forward with confidence to Christ until the law is fulfilled.
The purpose of the law was given for this reason; thus, the law is as good as dead to us, and we are alive in Christ because of our faith; we still observe the law out of obedience to the commandments.
We talk about Christ, we rejoice in Him, we preach about Him, we prophesy about Him, and we write our prophecies so that our children know where to look for forgiveness of their sins.
Therefore, we discuss the law so our children understand its deadness; knowing its deadness helps them look forward to the life found in Christ and understand the purpose of the law. After Christ fulfills the law, they shouldn't harden their hearts to Him when the law is no longer needed.
Now listen, my people, you are stubborn; I have spoken plainly so you cannot misunderstand. My words will serve as evidence against you, as they are enough to teach anyone the right path; the right path is to believe in Christ and not deny Him; denying Him means you also deny the prophets and the law.
So, I tell you that the right path is to believe in Christ and not deny Him; Christ is the Holy One of Israel; therefore, you must bow before Him and worship Him with all your strength, mind, and soul; if you do this, you will never be cast out.
As long as it is necessary, you must continue to observe the ordinances of God until the law given to Moses is fulfilled.
