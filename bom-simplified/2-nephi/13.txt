The Lord, who commands the heavenly armies, will remove the support and resources that Jerusalem and Judah rely on, including their food and water.
He will take away the strong warriors, judges, prophets, wise individuals, and elders.
The leaders, respected men, advisors, skilled craftsmen, and persuasive speakers will also be taken away.
Instead, children will be appointed as rulers, and even infants will govern.
The people will mistreat each other and be cruel to their neighbors; children will act defiantly toward older adults, and those of low status will disrespect the honorable.
When someone tries to take charge of their brother’s household by saying: "You have clothes; you should lead us and prevent our downfall"—
On that day they will insist: "I cannot be a leader; my house has no food or clothes; do not make me a ruler over the people."
Jerusalem has been devastated and Judah has fallen because their words and actions have gone against the Lord, provoking His anger.
Their faces expose their guilt, revealing their sins as openly as those of Sodom, and they cannot conceal it. Woe to them, for they have brought harm upon themselves!
Tell the righteous that all is well for them; they will enjoy the results of their good actions.
Woe to the wicked, for they will be destroyed; the consequences of their actions will affect them!
My people suffer because children oppress them, and women lead them astray. O my people, those who guide you have made you stray and have corrupted your paths.
The Lord stands up to argue on behalf of His people and to render judgment.
The Lord will confront the elders and leaders among His people; you have taken advantage of the vineyard and exploited the poor in your homes.
What is the meaning of your actions? You crush my people and mistreat the needy, says the Lord God of Hosts.
Furthermore, the Lord says: Because the daughters of Zion are proud and walk around with their heads held high and flirtatious eyes, strutting and making noise with their feet—
Therefore, the Lord will afflict the tops of their heads with sores, exposing their hidden flaws.
On that day the Lord will remove their elegant jewelry, their elaborate headdresses, and moon-shaped ornaments;
He will take away their chains, bracelets, and scarves;
Their hats, leg jewelry, headbands, tablets, and earrings;
Their rings and nose rings;
Their fancy clothing, capes, shawls, and hair curlers;
Their mirrors, fine linens, hoods, and veils.
Instead of a sweet fragrance, there will be a foul odor; instead of a lovely belt, there will be a torn cloth; instead of well-styled hair, there will be baldness; instead of a beautiful gown, there will be a rough sackcloth; instead of beauty, there will be burning.
Your men will fall in battle, and your warriors will perish in war.
Her city gates will mourn and cry out; she will become desolate and sit on the ground in sorrow.
