During the reign of Ahaz, who was the son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, the king of Judah, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, approached Jerusalem to attack it, but they couldn’t succeed.
The house of David received word that Syria and Ephraim were allied against them. This alarmed Ahaz and his people, making them feel as shaken as trees swaying in the breeze.
Then the Lord spoke to Isaiah, saying: Go now to meet Ahaz with your son Shearjashub at the end of the waterway from the upper pool along the road to the laundress's field.
Tell him: Be careful, stay calm; don’t be afraid or lose heart because of the two smoldering firebrands—Rezin’s anger with Syria and the son of Remaliah’s anger.
Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted against you, saying:
Let’s attack Judah, cause trouble for it, and set up our own king there, specifically the son of Tabeal.
The Lord God says this: Their plans will not succeed and won’t happen.
The leader of Syria is Damascus, and Rezin is the leader of Damascus; within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be shattered and cease to exist as a people.
Ephraim’s leader is Samaria, and Remaliah's son is the leader of Samaria. If you don't have faith, you surely won’t be secure.
Then the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying:
Ask for a sign from the Lord your God; it can be deep below or high above.
But Ahaz replied: I won’t ask for a sign, nor will I test the Lord.
And he said: Listen now, house of David; is it not enough for you to make men tired? Will you also tire out my God?
So the Lord himself will give you a sign—Look, a virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel.
He will eat butter and honey, so he will learn to reject evil and choose what is good.
Before the child knows how to reject evil and choose good, the land you dread will be abandoned by both its kings.
The Lord will bring upon you, your people, and your ancestors' house, times unlike any since Ephraim separated from Judah, the king of Assyria.
On that day, the Lord will whistle for the fly that is in the farthest part of Egypt and for the bee from the land of Assyria.
They will come and settle in the desolate valleys, the cracks in the rocks, and on all thorns and bushes.
On that day, the Lord will shave your head and feet with a hired razor from beyond the river, from the king of Assyria, and he will also remove your beard.
On that day, a man will raise a young cow and two sheep;
And from the abundant milk they produce, he will eat butter; everyone who survives in the land will eat butter and honey.
It will happen that on that day, every place where there were once a thousand vines worth a thousand pieces of silver will become overgrown with briers and thorns.
People will come with bows and arrows because the whole land will turn into briers and thorns.
And in all the hills that are tilled with tools, there won’t be the fear of briers and thorns; it will instead be for grazing cattle and for the trampling of sheep.
