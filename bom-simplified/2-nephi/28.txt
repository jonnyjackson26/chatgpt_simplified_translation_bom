In the last days, many false churches will be established, teaching empty and foolish beliefs. Apostasy will be widespread due to deceitful teachers, and the devil will stir up anger in people's hearts, promoting all types of false teachings.  
Brothers, I have shared with you what the Spirit has guided me to say; therefore, I am confident these events will indeed happen.
What is written in this book will be very valuable to humanity, especially to our descendants, who are part of the remnant of Israel.
On that day, the churches built not for the Lord will argue among themselves, with each claiming to belong to the Lord, even though their foundations are not in Him.
They will fight with each other and their leaders will also argue, teaching their own ideas and rejecting the Holy Ghost, which inspires true speech.
They will deny God's power, the Holy One of Israel, telling people to listen to them instead, claiming there is no God today, since the Lord has done His work and given His authority to men.
Listen to my advice; if they claim a miracle is done by the Lord, don’t believe them; because today, He is not performing miracles; His work is complete.
Indeed, many will say: Enjoy life, for tomorrow we die; and all will be fine for us.
There will also be many who say: Enjoy life, but also fear God—He will excuse small sins; lie a little, take advantage of others, cause your neighbor harm—none of this matters. If we are guilty, God will punish us lightly, and eventually, we'll be saved in His kingdom.
Yes, many will promote such false and foolish beliefs, becoming arrogant and hiding their true intentions from the Lord, doing their work in secret.
And the blood of the faithful will call out from the ground against them.
Yes, they have strayed from the right path and have become corrupt.
Because of pride and deceptive teachers and teachings, their churches have become corrupt and full of themselves, all due to their arrogance.
They exploit the poor for their luxurious buildings and attire; they persecute the humble and the poor in spirit because of their pride and arrogance.
They are stiff-necked and haughty; and because of their pride, evil deeds, and sins, they have gone astray, except for a few humble followers of Christ, who are still misled because they are taught human doctrines.
Oh, the wise, learned, and wealthy, who are filled with pride, those who preach false teachings and commit immoral acts, woe unto them, declares the Lord God Almighty, for they will be cast down to hell!
Woe to those who ignore justice for trivial things and mock what is good, saying it has no value! The day will come when the Lord will swiftly judge the people on earth; and when they are completely filled with sin, they will perish.
But if the people of the earth repent of their sins and wrongdoings, they shall be saved, says the Lord of Hosts.
But behold, that great and wicked church, the source of all evil, must be brought down, and its fall will be tremendous.
For the devil’s kingdom must be shaken, and those in it will be prompted to repent, or the devil will bind them with his everlasting chains and lead them into wrath and destruction.
For on that day, he will incite anger in people against goodness.
And others he will soothe, leading them into complacency, making them believe: All is well in Zion; yes, Zion is prospering, all is well—and thus the devil deceives their souls and carefully leads them down to hell.
And behold, he will also deceive others, denying the existence of hell, claiming: I am not a devil, for there is no devil—and so he whispers to them until he captures them in his terrible chains, from which there is no escape.
Yes, they are seized by death and hell; and they, along with all who have been taken with them, must stand before God’s throne and be judged for their actions, after which they will be sent to a place prepared for them—a lake of fire and brimstone, filled with endless suffering.
Therefore, woe to anyone who is complacent in Zion!
Woe to anyone who shouts: All is well!
Indeed, woe to anyone who follows human doctrines and denies God's power and the gift of the Holy Ghost!
Woe to anyone who says: We have received enough and need no more!
And ultimately, woe to all who tremble and are angry at the truth of God! For those on the solid foundation will receive the truth with joy; but those on shifting sand will tremble at the thought of falling.
Woe to anyone who claims: We have heard God's word, and we don’t need any more, for we have enough!
For behold, the Lord God says: I will teach humanity line upon line, precept upon precept, a little here, a little there; and blessed are those who listen to my guidance and pay attention to my counsel, for they will gain wisdom; for to those who accept, I will give even more; but from those who say, We have enough, even what they have will be taken away.
Cursed is anyone who puts their trust in human beings, who relies on their own strength, or listens to human doctrines unless they are inspired by the power of the Holy Ghost.
Woe to the Gentiles, says the Lord of Hosts! For even though I reach out my hand to them daily, they will deny me; however, I will still show mercy to them, says the Lord God, if they repent and come to me; for my hand is stretched out all day long, declares the Lord of Hosts.
