Jacob recounts Jewish history: The Babylonian captivity and return; the ministry and crucifixion of the Holy One of Israel; the help received from the Gentiles; and the Jews’ latter-day restoration when they believe in the Messiah. About 559–545 B.C.
The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spoke to the people of Nephi:
Listen, my dear friends, I, Jacob, have been called by God and set apart for my sacred role, and my brother Nephi has ordained me; you look to him as your king and protector, and you rely on him for your safety. You know that I have shared a lot with you already.
Still, I want to talk to you again because I care deeply about your spiritual well-being. Yes, I worry greatly for you, as you know I always have. I have urged you with great effort; I have taught you the words of my father; and I have discussed everything that has been written since the beginning of the world.
Now, I want to talk to you about both current events and future happenings; therefore, I will share with you the words of Isaiah. These are the words my brother asked me to convey to you. I speak for your benefit, so that you may learn and honor the name of your God.
Now, the words I will read are those that Isaiah proclaimed for all the descendants of Israel; thus, they can be related to you, as you are also part of the house of Israel. Many of the things Isaiah said can be related to you, because you belong to the house of Israel.
Here are the words: This is what the Lord God says: Look, I will raise my hand to the Gentiles and establish my banner for the people; they will carry your sons in their arms, and your daughters will be held on their shoulders.
Kings will care for you like fathers, and queens will care for you like mothers; they will bow to you with their faces to the ground and lick the dust off your feet; and you will know that I am the Lord; for those who wait for me will not be ashamed.
Now I, Jacob, want to say a bit about these words. Look, the Lord has revealed to me that the people in Jerusalem, where we came from, have been killed and taken captive.
However, the Lord also revealed to me that they will return. He also showed me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, will reveal himself to them in person; and after he reveals himself, they will beat and crucify him, just as the angel told me.
After they have hardened their hearts and resisted the Holy One of Israel, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel will come upon them. A day will come when they will be struck down and suffer greatly.
So, after they are tossed about, as the angel says, many will suffer in body but will not perish because of the prayers of the faithful; they will be scattered, stricken, and hated; yet, the Lord will be merciful to them. When they come to recognize their Redeemer, they will be gathered back to their rightful lands.
Blessed are the Gentiles, the ones the prophet talked about; for behold, if they repent and do not fight against Zion, and do not join that great and wicked church, they will be saved; for the Lord God will keep his promises to his children; and this is why the prophet wrote these things.
Therefore, those who oppose Zion and the Lord's covenant people will bow down to them; and the people of the Lord will not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are those who wait for him; they still look forward to the coming of the Messiah.
And look, according to the prophet's words, the Messiah will come again to reclaim them; therefore, he will reveal himself to them with great power and glory to destroy their enemies, at the time when they believe in him; and none who believe in him will be destroyed.
But those who do not believe in him will be destroyed by fire, storms, earthquakes, violence, disease, and famine. And they will know that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel.
Can the strong take away the prey, or set free those taken captive?
But the Lord says: Even the captives of the strong will be taken away, and the prey of the cruel will be rescued; for the Mighty God will save his covenant people. The Lord says: I will fight against those who fight against you—
And I will make those who oppress you consume their own flesh; they will be intoxicated with their own blood as if it were sweet wine; and all will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior and Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
