Nephi’s words are true—they confirm the existence of Christ—Those who trust in Christ will accept Nephi’s words, which will serve as a testimony during judgment. About 559–545 B.C.
Now, I, Nephi, cannot write everything that was taught to my people; I am not as skilled in writing as I am in speaking; for when someone speaks with the power of the Holy Ghost, it reaches the hearts of people.
However, many people harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, which leaves no room for it in them; as a result, they ignore many important things that are written and view them as worthless.
But I, Nephi, have recorded what I have written, and I consider it extremely valuable, especially for my people. I pray for them daily, and I often cry at night because of their struggles; I call upon God in faith, knowing that He will hear my prayers.
I believe that the Lord God will bless my prayers for the benefit of my people. The words I have written in weakness will grow strong for them; they encourage them to do good, connect them to their ancestors, and speak of Jesus, urging them to believe in Him and endure until the end, which is eternal life.
These words also strongly condemn sin, in the simplest terms; therefore, no one will be upset by what I have written unless they are influenced by the devil.
I take pride in being straightforward; I take pride in truth; I take pride in my Jesus, for He has saved my soul from hell.
I have love for my people and great faith in Christ that I will meet many pure souls at His judgment seat.
I have love for the Jews—I use the term Jew to refer to those from whom I descended.
I also have love for the Gentiles. But behold, I can hope for none of these unless they are reconciled to Christ, enter through the narrow gate, and follow the straight path that leads to life, continuing on this path until the end of their mortal lives.
And now, my dear brothers, as well as Jews, and all of you around the world, listen to these words and believe in Christ; and if you do not believe these words, believe in Christ. And if you believe in Christ, then you will believe these words, for they are the words of Christ, given to me; they teach everyone to do good.
If these are not the words of Christ, then you must judge for yourselves—Christ will reveal to you, with power and great glory, that these are indeed His words on the last day; and you and I will stand face to face before Him, and you will know that I was commanded by Him to write these things despite my weaknesses.
I pray to the Father in Christ’s name that many of us, if not all, may be saved in His kingdom on that great and final day.
Now, my beloved brothers, all those who are part of the house of Israel and all of you across the earth, I speak to you as someone shouting from the dust: Farewell until that great day comes.
And to those who will not accept the goodness of God, disregard the words of the Jews, my words, and the words that will come from the Lamb of God, I bid you a lasting farewell, for these words will condemn you on the last day.
For whatever I declare on earth will be held against you at the judgment; for this is what the Lord has commanded me, and I must comply. Amen.
