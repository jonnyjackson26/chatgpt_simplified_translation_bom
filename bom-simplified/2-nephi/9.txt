Jacob talks about how the Jews will be brought together in all their promised lands—The Atonement saves humans from the Fall—The bodies of the dead will rise from the grave, and their spirits from hell and paradise—They will face judgment—The Atonement protects from death, hell, the devil, and everlasting suffering—The righteous will be saved in God's kingdom—Consequences for sins are explained—The Holy One of Israel is the gatekeeper. About 559–545 B.C.
Now, my dear brothers and sisters, I’ve shared these things so you can understand the promises the Lord made with the whole house of Israel—
He has communicated with the Jews, through His holy prophets, from the very start and across generations, until the time comes when they will be brought back to the true church and family of God; when they will return to their promised lands and be established in all their inheritance.
I want you to understand these things so you can be joyful and always hold your heads high, because of the blessings the Lord God will give to your children.
I know many of you have sought to understand what the future holds; therefore, I know you realize that our physical bodies will wear out and die; however, we will still see God in our bodies.
Yes, I know you understand that He will reveal Himself to those in Jerusalem, from where we originated; it is necessary for Him to do this among them; it is right that the great Creator should become like us in the flesh and die for everyone, so that all might become subject to Him.
Just as death came upon all people to fulfill the kind plan of the great Creator, there must be the power of resurrection, which comes to humans because of the Fall; and the Fall occurred because of sin; and because humans fell, they were cut off from God's presence.
Therefore, there must be an infinite atonement—without such an atonement, this corruption could not become incorruptible. If it didn’t, the first judgment on humanity would have lasted forever. If that were the case, our flesh would simply decay and return to the earth without rising again.
Oh, the wisdom of God, His mercy and grace! For if the flesh were never to rise again, our spirits would be captured by that fallen angel, who became the devil, never to rise again.
Our spirits would be made like him, and we would become devils, companions to a devil, excluded from the presence of our God and stuck with the father of lies, in misery like his own; yes, to that being who deceived our first parents, who transforms himself to look nearly like an angel of light, and incites people to secret plots of murder and all kinds of dark actions.
Oh, how great is the goodness of our God, who provides a way for us to escape this terrifying monster; yes, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body and also the death of the spirit.
Because of God's plan for our deliverance, this death, which I have referred to as the physical, will give up its dead; this death is the grave.
And the spiritual death I mentioned will release its dead; this spiritual death is hell; therefore, death and hell must release their dead, hell must give back its captured spirits, and the grave must give back its captured bodies, and the bodies and spirits of people will be reunited; all through the power of the resurrection from the Holy One of Israel.
Oh, how great is our God's plan! For on the other side, the paradise of God must turn over the spirits of the righteous, and the grave must give back the bodies of the righteous; and spirit and body will be restored together, and everyone will become incorruptible and immortal, living as souls with perfect knowledge just like we have in the flesh, except that our knowledge will be perfected.
So we will have perfect awareness of all our guilt and our impurities and our nakedness; and the righteous will have perfect knowledge of their joy and their goodness, being clothed with purity and even with the robe of righteousness.
And it will happen that when all people have transitioned from this first death to life, as they become immortal, they must stand before the judgment seat of the Holy One of Israel; and at that point comes the judgment, and then they must be judged according to God's holy judgment.
And surely, as the Lord lives, for the Lord God has declared it, and it is His eternal word that cannot be undone, the righteous will remain righteous, and those who are corrupted will remain corrupted; hence, those who are filthy are the devil and his angels, and they will go away into everlasting fire, created for them; and their torment will be like a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames rise forever and ever without end.
Oh, the greatness and justice of our God! For He fulfills all that He says, and His words have come forth from His mouth, and His law must be upheld.
But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, those who have believed in Him, who have endured the trials of the world and shunned its shame, they will inherit the kingdom of God, prepared for them since the world's foundation, and their joy will be complete forever.
Oh, the vast mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For He rescues His saints from that dreadful monster, the devil, and from death, from hell, and from that endless lake of fire and brimstone of suffering.
Oh, how great the holiness of our God! For He knows all things, and there is nothing He does not know.
He comes into the world so that He might save everyone who listens to His call; for behold, He bears the pains of all people, yes, the suffering of every being, men, women, and children, who belong to humanity.
And He endures this so that resurrection can happen for all, so that everyone may stand before Him on that great judgment day.
He commands everyone to repent and be baptized in His name, having complete faith in the Holy One of Israel, or they cannot be saved in God's kingdom.
And if they refuse to repent, believe in His name, and be baptized in His name, and endure to the end, they will be condemned; for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has declared it.
Therefore, He has given a law; and where there is no law, there is no punishment; where there is no punishment, there is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy One of Israel apply, because of the atonement; they are saved by His power.
The atonement satisfies the demands of His justice for all those who have not received the law, saving them from that dreadful monster, death and hell, the devil, and the endless lake of fire; and they are restored to the God who gave them life, the Holy One of Israel.
But woe to anyone who has received the law, yes, and has all of God's commandments like we do, yet breaks them and squanders the time of their probation; for their fate is terrifying!
Oh, the deceptive plan of the evil one! Oh, the uselessness, weaknesses, and foolishness of people! When they are educated, they think they are wise and do not listen to God’s counsel; they disregard it, thinking they know better, so their wisdom is foolishness and brings them no benefit. And they will be lost.
But being educated is good as long as they heed God's counsel.
But woe to the wealthy, those rich in worldly things. Because they have wealth, they look down on the poor, persecute the humble, and focus on their treasures; consequently, their treasure becomes their god. And look, their treasure will perish along with them.
And woe to the deaf who refuse to listen; for they will perish.
Woe to the blind who refuse to see; for they will also perish.
Woe to the unclean-hearted, for the knowledge of their sins will strike them on the last day.
Woe to the liar, for he will be cast down to hell.
Woe to the murderer who kills intentionally, for he will die.
Woe to those who commit sexual immorality, for they will be cast down to hell.
Yes, woe to those who worship idols, for the worst of all devils rejoices in them.
And lastly, woe to all those who die in their sins; for they will return to God, see His face, and remain in their sins.
Oh, my dear brothers and sisters, remember the seriousness of sinning against that Holy God, and also the seriousness of giving in to the temptations of that crafty one. Remember, being focused on worldly desires leads to death, while being spiritually focused leads to eternal life.
Oh, my dear brothers and sisters, pay attention to my words. Remember the importance of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken harshly to you; for if you do, you will reject the truth; for I have shared the words of your Creator. I know that the truth can seem harsh against all impurity; but the righteous do not fear them, for they love the truth and are not shaken.
So then, my dear brothers and sisters, come to the Lord, the Holy One. Remember that His ways are right. The path for man is narrow, but it lies straight ahead, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; He has no servants there; and there is no other way except through the gate; for He cannot be fooled, for the Lord God is His name.
And whoever knocks, to them He will open; and the wise, the educated, and the rich, who are puffed up because of their knowledge, wisdom, and material wealth—yes, they are the ones He disdains; unless they throw away these things, humble themselves as fools before God, and come down in complete humility, He will not open the gate to them.
But the wisdom of the knowledgeable and the prudent will be hidden from them forever—yes, the happiness prepared for the saints.
Oh, my dear brothers and sisters, remember my words. Behold, I take off my garments and shake them before you; I pray the God of my salvation to see me with His all-searching eye; so that you will know on the last day, when all people will be judged by their deeds, that the God of Israel bore witness that I shook off your sins from my soul, and that I stand radiant before Him, free from your blood.
Oh, my dear brothers and sisters, turn away from your sins; break off the chains of the one who seeks to bind you; come to that God who is the rock of your salvation.
Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice will be served to the righteous, the day of judgment, so that you do not shrink back in dreadful fear; so that you do not remember your guilt in full clarity and feel compelled to say: Holy, holy are Your judgments, O Lord God Almighty—but I know my guilt; I broke Your law, and my sins are my own; and the devil has claimed me, and I have become prey to his awful misery.
But tell me, my brethren, is it necessary for me to awaken you to the terrifying truth of these things? Would I distress your souls if your minds were pure? Would I be straightforward with you according to the simplicity of the truth if you were free from sin?
Look, if you were holy, I would talk to you about holiness; but since you are not holy, and you see me in the role of a teacher, it must be essential for me to teach you about the repercussions of sin.
Behold, my soul detests sin, and my heart rejoices in righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.
Come, my brothers, everyone who is thirsty, come to the waters; and if you have no money, come buy and eat; yes, come buy wine and milk without money and at no cost.
So, do not spend your money on what is worthless, nor your efforts on what cannot satisfy. Listen carefully to me, and remember the words I have spoken; come to the Holy One of Israel, and feast on what cannot perish or be corrupted, and let your soul revel in richness.
Look, my beloved brothers, remember the words of your God; pray to Him continually during the day, and give thanks to His holy name at night. Let your hearts be filled with joy.
And see how great the promises of the Lord are, and how deeply He condescends to His children; and because of His greatness, grace, and mercy, He has promised us that our descendants will not be completely destroyed, according to the flesh, but He will protect them; and in future generations, they will become a righteous branch of the house of Israel.
And now, my brethren, I would say more to you; but tomorrow I will share the rest of my thoughts. Amen.
