And now, look, my dear friends, I think you are thinking deeply about what you should do after you have started your journey. But, why are you thinking these thoughts in your hearts? 
Do you not remember that I told you that after you receive the Holy Ghost, you will be able to communicate like angels? And now, how can you communicate like angels unless it is through the Holy Ghost?
Angels communicate with the authority of the Holy Ghost; therefore, they express the words of Christ. So, I encourage you to immerse yourselves in the words of Christ; for these words will guide you on everything you need to do.
Therefore, after I have shared these thoughts, if you do not understand them, it may be because you are not asking or seeking; hence, you remain in the darkness instead of coming into the light.
For I say to you again, if you choose to start on this journey and receive the Holy Ghost, it will reveal to you all the things you should do.
This is the teaching of Christ, and no further teachings will be given until he appears to you in person. And when he does appear to you in person, you must follow the things he tells you.
And now, I, Nephi, cannot say anything more; the Spirit is preventing me from speaking, and I feel sad because of the disbelief, wickedness, ignorance, and stubbornness of people; for they do not seek knowledge, nor do they understand profound truths that are presented to them plainly, as clearly as possible.
And now, my dear friends, I see that you are still deep in thought, and it pains me that I must address this issue. If you would listen to the Spirit that teaches people to pray, you would realize that you must pray; for the evil spirit does not encourage a person to pray but instead convinces them not to.
But look, I tell you that you must pray continuously and not give up; that you should not do anything for the Lord unless you first pray to the Father in the name of Christ, asking him to bless your actions so that they benefit your soul.
