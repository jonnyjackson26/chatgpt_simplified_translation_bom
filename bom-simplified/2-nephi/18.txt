Christ will be a source of conflict and a challenge for many—Seek the Lord instead of relying on fortune tellers—Look to the law and the prophetic messages for guidance—This aligns with Isaiah 8. About 559–545 B.C.
Furthermore, the Lord told me: Take a large scroll and write on it clearly about Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
I also gathered reliable witnesses to record this, Uriah the priest and Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah.
I approached the prophetess, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. The Lord instructed me to name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
For this child will not be able to say "My father" or "My mother" before the riches of Damascus and the loot of Samaria are taken away by the king of Assyria.
The Lord also spoke to me again, saying:
Since this people rejects the gentle waters of Shiloah, and instead celebrates Rezin and the son of Remaliah;
Now, behold, the Lord is bringing upon them powerful and numerous waters from the river, the king of Assyria and all his glory; he will overflow all his channels and banks.
He will move through Judah; he will overflow and go over, reaching up to the neck; and his wings will stretch out to cover your entire land, O Immanuel.
You people should unite, but you will be shattered; listen you from far-off places; prepare yourselves, but you will be shattered; prepare yourselves, but you will be shattered.
Make plans together, but they will come to nothing; speak your words, and they will not succeed, because God is with us.
For the Lord strongly communicated to me that I should not follow the way of this people, saying:
Do not say, “A conspiracy,” in response to what this people says is a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, nor be afraid.
Honor the Lord of Hosts as holy, and let him be your source of fear and dread.
He will be a safe place, but to both houses of Israel, he will be a source of conflict, a trap, and a snare for the people of Jerusalem.
Many will stumble and fall, be broken, trapped, and taken.
Confirm the testimony, and seal the law among my followers.
I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will seek him.
Look, I and the children the Lord has given me are like signs and wonders in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.
When they tell you: Consult those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards who mutter—Shouldn’t a people seek their God rather than the living for advice from the dead?
Look to the law and the prophetic messages; if they do not speak according to this word, it is because they have no light in them.
They will struggle and feel hungry; and when they are hungry, they will become angry, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.
They will look to the earth and see distress, darkness, and despair, and will be driven into darkness.
