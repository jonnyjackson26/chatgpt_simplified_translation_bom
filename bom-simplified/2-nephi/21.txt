A branch will grow from the lineage of Jesse, and a new shoot will emerge from its roots.
The Spirit of the Lord will be upon him, bringing wisdom and understanding, guidance and strength, knowledge and reverence for the Lord.
He will have quick understanding in respecting the Lord and won't judge by what he sees or hear what he hears.
He will judge the poor fairly and correct the humble with justice; he will speak powerfully, and with his words, he will defeat the wicked.
Righteousness will be his belt, and faithfulness will be his strength.
Wolves will live peacefully with lambs, leopards will rest with young goats, and calves, lions, and fattened animals will coexist, led by a small child.
Cows and bears will graze together, their young will lie down alongside each other, and lions will eat grass like cattle.
A nursing child will play near a snake's hole, and a toddler will touch the den of a venomous snake.
They will not harm or destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, just like the sea is full of water.
On that day, a root from Jesse will rise as a banner for the people; nations will seek it, and it will bring great peace.
On that day, the Lord will reach out his hand again to bring back the remnant of his people from various places, including Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and islands across the sea.
He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the outcasts of Israel, bringing together the scattered people of Judah from every corner of the earth.
The jealousy between Ephraim and Judah will end; Ephraim will no longer resent Judah, and Judah will not trouble Ephraim.
They will unitedly fly against the Philistines to the west, plundering those in the east, and they will also overpower Edom and Moab; the children of Ammon will submit to them.
The Lord will completely destroy the language of the Egyptian sea; with his powerful wind, he will signal over the river, dividing it into seven streams, allowing people to cross on dry ground.
There will be a clear path for the remnant of his people left from Assyria, just as there was for Israel when they left the land of Egypt.
