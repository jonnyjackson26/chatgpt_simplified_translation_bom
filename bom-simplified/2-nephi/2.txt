Redemption comes through the Holy Messiah—Freedom of choice (agency) is essential to existence and progression—Adam fell so that humanity could exist—People have the freedom to choose liberty and eternal life. About 588–570 B.C.
Now, Jacob, I want to talk to you: You are my firstborn during my struggles in the wilderness. And look, during your childhood you have faced hardships and much sorrow because of how your brothers have treated you.
But still, Jacob, my firstborn in the wilderness, you know how great God is; He will use your sufferings for your benefit.
Therefore, your spirit will be blessed, and you will live safely with your brother, Nephi; your life will be spent serving your God. I know that you are redeemed because of the goodness of your Redeemer; you have seen that, in the fullness of time, He will come to save mankind.
You have witnessed His glory in your youth; therefore, you are blessed just like those to whom He will serve in the flesh; the Spirit remains unchanged, yesterday, today, and forever. The way has been prepared since the fall of man, and salvation is available to all.
People are given enough understanding to know the difference between good and evil. The law has been given to humanity. And no one can be justified by the law; or, through the law, people are cut off. Yes, because of the temporal law, they were cut off; and through the spiritual law, they are separated from that which is good and become miserable forever.
Thus, redemption comes through the Holy Messiah, for He is full of grace and truth.
Look, He offers Himself as a sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the demands of the law, for all those who have a broken heart and a humble spirit; and for no one else can the requirements of the law be fulfilled.
Because of how important this is, we must share it with the people on earth, so they can know that no human can dwell in the presence of God unless it is through the worth, mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who gives His life in the flesh and rises again by the power of the Spirit, so He can ensure the resurrection of the dead, being the first to rise.
Thus, He is the first offering to God, as He will plead for all of humanity; and those who believe in Him will be saved.
Because of His plea for everyone, all people can approach God; thus, they stand in His presence to be judged according to the truth and holiness that exists in Him. So, the requirements of the law given by the Holy One come with punishment for those opposed to the happiness that is intended, to fulfill the purpose of the atonement—
It is necessary that there be opposition in all things. Without it, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not exist, nor could wickedness, holiness or misery, good or bad. Therefore, everything must function as a single unit; if it were just one entity, it would be dead, with no life, no death, no corruption, no incorruption, no happiness, no misery, no awareness, and no numbness.
Therefore, it must have been created for nothing; thus, there would be no purpose in its creation. Such a situation would contradict the wisdom of God and His eternal plans, as well as His power, mercy, and justice.
If you claim there is no law, you would also claim there is no sin. If you say there is no sin, you would also say there is no righteousness. And if there is no righteousness, there is no happiness. If there is no righteousness or happiness, there is no punishment or misery. If none of these exist, then there is no God. And without God, we do not exist, neither does the earth; for without creation, nothing could act or be acted upon; thus, everything would have disappeared.
Now, my sons, I share these truths with you for your growth and understanding; for there is a God, and He has created all things, both heaven and earth, and everything within them, including things that act and things that are acted upon.
In order to achieve His eternal goals for humanity, after creating our first parents, and the animals of the earth and birds of the air, and everything else that was created, there had to be opposition; the forbidden fruit stands against the tree of life; one is sweet, the other is bitter.
Therefore, the Lord God gave man the ability to act for himself. Thus, a person could not act for themselves unless tempted by one of the two choices.
And I, Lehi, based on what I have read, must suppose that an angel of God, as written, fell from heaven; therefore, he became a devil, having chosen to do evil in God's sight.
And because he fell from heaven and became miserable forever, he also sought to bring misery to all humanity. So, he spoke to Eve, even that ancient serpent, who is the devil, the father of all lies, and he said: Eat the forbidden fruit, and you will not die, but you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they were cast out of the garden of Eden to cultivate the earth.
And they began to have children; indeed, this gave rise to all of humanity.
And the lives of humanity were extended, according to God's will, so that they could repent while alive; thus, their existence became a time of testing, and their duration was increased, as God commanded. For He commanded that everyone must repent; He made it clear that they were lost because of their parents' disobedience.
Now, behold, if Adam had not disobeyed, he would not have fallen, and he would have remained in the garden of Eden. All that was created would have stayed in its original state and lasting forever, with no end.
And they would not have had children; thus, they would have remained innocent, having no joy as they knew no suffering; doing no good, as they knew no sin.
But behold, all things have been accomplished with the wisdom of Him who knows all.
Adam fell so that humanity might exist; and humans exist so that they may experience joy.
The Messiah comes in the fullness of time to redeem humanity from the fall. And because they are redeemed from the fall, they are free forever, able to distinguish between good and evil; they act for themselves and are not acted upon, except by the judgment of the law on the great final day, according to the commandments that God has given.
Thus, humanity is free in the flesh; everything is provided that is necessary for people. They are free to choose liberty and eternal life through the great Mediator of all people or to choose captivity and death, based on the devil's bondage; for he seeks to make all humans miserable just like him.
Now, my sons, I hope you will look to the great Mediator, listen to His great commandments, remain faithful to His words, and choose eternal life according to the will of His Holy Spirit;
And do not choose eternal death according to the desires of the flesh and the evil within it, which gives the spirit of the devil the power to trap you and lead you to destruction, so he can rule over you in his kingdom.
I have shared these few thoughts with all of you, my sons, during the final days of my life; and I have chosen the good path, in line with the prophet's words. My only concern is for the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
