Redemption is found through the Holy Messiah—Having the ability to choose is crucial for life and growth—Adam fell so that people could exist—People have the freedom to choose liberty and eternal life.
Jacob, I want to talk to you: You are my first child during my struggles in the wilderness. You have faced hardships and much sadness in your youth because of how harsh your brothers have been.
Still, Jacob, my first child in the wilderness, you know how great God is; He will turn your difficulties into something good for you.
As a result, you will be blessed, and you will live safely with your brother, Nephi; you will spend your life serving God. Therefore, I am confident that you are saved because of the goodness of your Redeemer; you have seen that in due time, He comes to offer salvation to all people.
You have seen His glory in your youth; thus, you are blessed just like those He will help in person; the Spirit remains the same through all time. The way has been prepared since the beginning, and salvation is freely available.
People are taught enough to recognize right from wrong. Laws have been given to them. However, no one can be justified by the law; or, through the law, people are separated from good. Yes, through earthly laws they were cut off; and also, through spiritual laws they lose connection with what is good and become forever miserable.
Thus, salvation comes through the Holy Messiah; He is full of grace and truth.
Look, He offers Himself as a sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the requirements of the law for those who are brokenhearted and humble; and no one else can fulfill the law’s requirements.
Hence, it is very important to share these truths with the people of the world, so they understand that no one can stand in the presence of God without the merits, mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who sacrificed His life in the flesh, and took it back by the Spirit’s power, to bring about the resurrection, being the first to rise.
Therefore, He is the first to bless God since He will intercede for all mankind; and those who believe in Him will be saved.
And because He intercedes for everyone, all people can come to God; thus, they will stand in His presence to be judged according to the truth and holiness that are found in Him. Consequently, the purposes of the law given by the Holy One involve punishment, which contrasts with happiness; this serves the purpose of making atonement—
For there must be an opposition in all things. If this were not the case, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not exist, nor could wickedness, holiness or misery, or good or bad. Hence, all things must be a mixture; if it were solely one kind, it would remain lifeless, lacking life or death, corruption or purity, joy or distress, or sensitivity or insensitivity.
Thus, it could only have been created for no reason; therefore, there would be no purpose in its creation. This scenario would undermine the wisdom of God and His eternal plans, along with His power, mercy, and justice.
If you claim there is no law, you must also claim there is no sin. If you say there is no sin, then you must also say there is no righteousness. And without righteousness, there can be no happiness. And if there is neither righteousness nor happiness, then there can be neither punishment nor misery. If none of these exist, then there is no God. If there is no God, then we do not exist, nor does the earth; because there could have been no creation or actions; thus, everything would have simply vanished.
Now, my sons, I share these truths with you for your understanding and benefit; for there is a God who created everything, both the heavens and the earth, and all that exists in them, including things that act and things that are acted upon.
To accomplish His eternal goals for humanity, after creating our first parents, along with the animals and birds, and everything that exists, there must have been opposites; even the forbidden fruit contrasted with the tree of life; one being sweet and the other bitter.
Thus, God gave man the ability to choose for himself. Therefore, man could not choose unless he was tempted by one option or the other.
According to what I, Lehi, have read, I must conclude that an angel of God, as written, fell from heaven; thus, becoming a devil by seeking evil in God’s sight.
And because he fell from heaven and became forever miserable, he sought to bring misery to all humanity. Thus, he told Eve, through the ancient serpent, who is the devil and the father of lies: Eat the forbidden fruit, and you will not die, but you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
After Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit, they were cast out of the garden of Eden to cultivate the earth.
They started families; indeed, all of humanity came from them.
And the life of humans was extended by God’s will so they could repent during their time on earth; hence, their existence became a test, and their time was prolonged, according to the commandments given by the Lord God. He commanded that everyone must repent, as He showed everyone that they were lost because of their parents' mistakes.
Now, behold, if Adam had not sinned, he would not have fallen, and he would have stayed in the garden of Eden. Everything that was created would have stayed in the same condition as it was upon creation; they would have remained forever without end.
And they would not have had children; thus, they would have remained innocent and would have lacked joy, for they would not have known suffering; they would have done no good, for they would not have known sin.
However, everything has occurred in the wisdom of the One who knows all things.
Adam fell so that individuals could exist; and individuals exist so they can find joy.
The Messiah comes at the perfect time to redeem humanity from the fall. Because they are redeemed, they become free forever, able to distinguish right from wrong; they can make their own choices rather than being controlled, except by the consequences of the law on the final judgment day, according to the commands given by God.
Therefore, people are free in their physical existence; and all things that are beneficial are given to them. They have the freedom to choose liberty and eternal life through the great Mediator of everyone, or to choose captivity and death, subject to the devil’s power; for he desires all to be miserable like him.
Now, my sons, I urge you to look to the great Mediator, listen to His important commandments; be devoted to His teachings, and choose eternal life according to the will of His Holy Spirit;
And do not choose eternal death, according to the desires of the flesh and the evil that resides within, which empowers the devil’s spirit to control you, leading you to destruction, where he may rule over you in his own domain.
I have shared these brief words with you all, my sons, during the final moments of my life; I have chosen what is good, following the prophet’s words. My only goal is the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
