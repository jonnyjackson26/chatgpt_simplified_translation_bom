Jacob continues reading from Isaiah: In the last days, the Lord will bring comfort to Zion and gather the people of Israel—Those who are redeemed will come to Zion with great joy.
Listen to me, you who seek to live righteously. Remember the source from which you came, and consider the depths from which you were lifted.
Remember Abraham, your ancestor, and Sarah, who gave you birth; I called him when he was alone, and I blessed him.
The Lord will comfort Zion; He will restore all her ruined places; He will turn her wasteland into a paradise, and her desert into a garden like the Lord’s. Joy and happiness will be found there, along with gratitude and the sound of songs.
Listen to me, my people; pay attention to me, my nation; for I will bring forth a law, and my judgment will be a guiding light for the people.
My righteousness is near; my salvation has come, and my strength will judge the people. The islands will wait for me, and they will trust in my strength.
Lift up your eyes to the skies and look down at the earth below; for the skies will disappear like smoke, and the earth will wear out like clothing; the people living on earth will die like that. But my salvation will last forever, and my righteousness will never vanish.
Listen to me, you who know righteousness, the people in whose hearts I have written my law; do not be afraid of the insults from men, nor be disheartened by their mockery.
For the moth will consume them like fabric, and the worm will eat them like wool. But my righteousness will last forever, and my salvation will continue from generation to generation.
Wake up, wake up! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awaken as you did in ancient times. Aren't you the one who defeated Rahab and wounded the sea monster?
Aren't you the one who dried up the sea, the mighty waters; who made a path through the depths of the sea for the redeemed to cross?
Therefore, those redeemed by the Lord will return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy and holiness will be upon them; they will find happiness and joy, and sorrow and mourning will disappear.
I am the one who comforts you. So, why should you be afraid of a mere mortal, who will die, or the human being, who is like grass?
And you forget the Lord your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, and you live every day in fear of the oppressor, as if he is ready to destroy you? Where is the anger of your oppressor?
The captive exile is eager to be freed, to avoid dying in the pit and to ensure he does not run out of food.
But I am the Lord your God, whose waves roared; the Lord of Hosts is my name.
I have placed my words in your mouth and concealed you in the shadow of my hand, so that I may create the heavens and establish the earth, and say to Zion: Look, you are my people.
Awake, awake! Stand up, O Jerusalem, who has tasted the Lord's anger— you have drunk from the cup of His wrath and have consumed the bitter dregs—
And there is no one to guide her among all her children; nor anyone to reach out a hand to her from all the sons she has raised.
These two sons have approached you, who will feel sorrow for you—your destruction and desolation, the famine and the sword—who will comfort you?
Your children have fainted, except for these two; they lie at the head of every street; like a wild bull caught in a trap, they are filled with the Lord's anger, the rebuke of your God.
So now listen to this, you who are afflicted and drunk, but not with wine:
Thus says your Lord, the Lord who is your God, who advocates for His people; look, I have taken the cup of trembling out of your hands, the bitter dregs of my anger; you will no longer drink it.
But I will hand it to those who hurt you; those who said to you: Bow down so we can walk over you—and you have laid your body like ground and a road for them to cross.
Wake up, wake up! Put on your strength, O Zion; put on your splendid garments, O holy city of Jerusalem; for from now on, no uncircumcised or unclean person will enter you.
Shake off the dust; rise up, sit down, O Jerusalem; free yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
