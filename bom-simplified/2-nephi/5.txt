Look, I cried out a lot to the Lord my God because my brothers were angry with me.
But their anger grew even more intense, to the point that they wanted to kill me.
They complained about me, saying: Our younger brother thinks he should be in charge; we've suffered a lot because of him. So now let's kill him to stop being troubled by his words. We don't want him as our leader; we, the older brothers, should lead our people.
I won’t write down everything they said against me, but it’s enough to say that they wanted to take my life.
Then the Lord warned me that I, Nephi, needed to leave them and flee into the wilderness, bringing whoever wanted to join me.
So, I took my family, Zoram and his family, my older brother Sam and his family, my younger brothers Jacob and Joseph, my sisters, and everyone else who wanted to come with me. Those who chose to come with me believed in God’s warnings and revelations, so they listened to what I said.
We gathered our tents and everything we could carry, and we traveled in the wilderness for many days. After traveling for many days, we set up our tents.
The people wanted to name the place Nephi, so we called it Nephi.
All those who were with me decided to call themselves the people of Nephi.
We made sure to follow the teachings, rules, and commandments of the Lord in everything, according to the law of Moses.
The Lord was with us, and we achieved great success; we planted seeds and reaped bountifully. We started raising flocks, herds, and all kinds of animals.
I had also brought the records engraved on the brass plates, and the ball or compass that the Lord had prepared for my father, as mentioned in the scriptures.
We prospered greatly and multiplied in the land.
I took Laban's sword and made many swords like it, to protect ourselves from the people now known as Lamanites, because I knew about their hatred toward me, my children, and my people.
I taught my people how to build structures and work with all sorts of materials like wood, iron, copper, brass, steel, gold, silver, and precious metals, which were plentiful.
I built a temple, modeled after Solomon's temple, but not made of precious materials because they weren’t available, so it couldn’t be exactly like Solomon’s temple. However, it was constructed in a similar way, and the workmanship was very fine.
I made sure my people worked hard and labored with their hands.
They wanted me to be their king, but I preferred that they have no king; nonetheless, I did what I could for them.
The Lord’s words to my brothers were fulfilled, saying I should be their ruler and teacher. So, I led and instructed them according to the Lord's commandments until they sought to kill me.
Thus, the Lord’s word was fulfilled, which said that because they wouldn’t listen to me, they would be cut off from His presence. And indeed, they were cut off.
The Lord caused a serious curse to come upon them because of their wickedness. They hardened their hearts against Him, becoming as hard as stone. As they were a beautiful people, to prevent them from being attractive to my people, the Lord made their skin dark.
The Lord God said: I will make them detestable to your people unless they repent of their sins.
And anyone who mixes with their people will also be cursed, receiving the same curse. The Lord spoke, and it happened.
Because of their curse, they became a lazy, troublesome people, seeking wild animals to hunt in the wilderness.
The Lord God told me: They will be a scourge to your descendants, to remind them of me; and if they don’t remember me and listen to my words, they will be punished even to destruction.
I consecrated Jacob and Joseph to be priests and teachers for my people.
We lived happily together.
Thirty years had passed since we left Jerusalem.
I kept the records of my people on the plates I made.
Then the Lord God instructed me to create more plates to engrave many good things for the benefit of my people.
So, I, Nephi, obeying the Lord’s commandments, went and made these plates where I engraved these things.
I wrote what is pleasing to God. If my people appreciate God’s words, they will like what I’ve engraved on these plates.
If my people want to know more details about their history, they should search my other plates.
It's enough to say that forty years had passed, and we had already engaged in wars and conflicts with our brothers.
