In the year that King Uzziah died, I also saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and exalted, and the hem of his robe filled the temple.
Standing above Him were angelic beings; each had six wings. With two wings, they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.
And one angel called to another, saying: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is filled with His glory.
The doorposts shook at the sound of their voices, and the whole place was filled with smoke.
Then I said: Oh no! I am lost; I am a person with unclean lips, and I live among a people with unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
Then one of the angels flew to me, holding a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with tongs;
He touched it to my mouth and said: Look, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin is cleansed.
I also heard the voice of the Lord saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I responded: Here I am; send me.
And He said: Go and tell this people—You will hear, but you won’t understand; you will see, but you won’t perceive.
Make this people's hearts dull, their ears heavy, and their eyes blind—so that they don’t see with their eyes, hear with their ears, or understand with their hearts, and turn back to be healed.
Then I asked: Lord, how long will this last? And He answered: Until the cities lie waste without inhabitants, and the houses are left empty, and the land is completely desolate;
And the Lord has removed people far away, for there will be a great forsaking in the land.
But still, a remnant will remain, and they will return, like an oak tree whose substance remains even when its leaves fall; so the holy offspring will be the strength of this remnant.
