Jacob saw his Savior—The law of Moses serves as a symbol for Christ and shows that He will come. About 559–545 B.C.
At that time, Jacob spoke many additional things to my people; however, I have only recorded these specific things, as what I have written is enough for me.
Now I, Nephi, am going to write more of Isaiah's words because I take great joy in them. I will relate his words to my people and share them with all my children because he truly saw my Redeemer, just as I have seen Him.
My brother, Jacob, has also seen Him, just as I have; therefore, I will share their words with my children to prove to them that what I say is true. By the words of three witnesses, God has declared that He will confirm His word. Still, God provides more witnesses, affirming all His words.
Look, my soul finds joy in showing my people the truth of Christ's coming; this is the purpose of the law of Moses. Everything given by God since the beginning of the world to mankind points to Him.
My soul also rejoices in the promises that the Lord made to our ancestors; yes, my soul delights in His grace, justice, power, and mercy in the grand and everlasting plan to save us from death.
My soul takes joy in showing my people that if Christ does not come, all people will perish.
For if there is no Christ, there is no God; and if there is no God, then we do not exist, as creation could not have happened. But there is a God, and He is Christ, and He will come at the perfect time.
Now I will write some of Isaiah's words so that anyone among my people who reads these words may lift their hearts and rejoice for everyone. These are the words, and you can apply them to yourselves and to all people.
