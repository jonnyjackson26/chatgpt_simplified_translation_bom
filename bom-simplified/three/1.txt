This message is addressed to all nations, families, languages, and people who receive this work: We, by the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates that hold this record. This record includes the history of the Nephites as well as the Lamanites, their relatives, and also the people of Jared, who came from the tower previously mentioned. We also know that these plates have been translated by God's gift and power, as His voice has made it known to us; thus, we are certain that this work is true. We also testify that we have seen the engravings on the plates; they were shown to us by God's power, not by human means. We state earnestly that an angel of God descended from heaven and presented the plates to us, allowing us to see them and the engravings on them; we understand that it is by the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ that we have witnessed and can confirm these truths. It is truly amazing to us. However, the Lord commanded us to bear witness of this; therefore, in obedience to God's commandments, we testify of these things. We believe that if we remain faithful in Christ, we will cleanse ourselves from the sins of humanity and be found blameless before Christ's judgment seat, ultimately living with Him forever in heaven. All honor goes to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are one God. Amen.
