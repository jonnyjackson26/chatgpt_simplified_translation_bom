Enos, knowing that my father was a good man who taught me the Lord's ways, is something I am grateful for.
I will share the struggle I had with God until I was forgiven for my sins.
I went out to hunt animals in the forest, and the teachings from my father about eternal life and the joy of being with the faithful filled my heart.
I felt a deep yearning, so I knelt down before God and earnestly prayed for my own salvation, crying out to Him all day long; even at night, my voice reached up to the heavens.
Then a voice came to me, saying: Enos, your sins are forgiven, and you will be blessed.
I understood that God could not deceive me, and my guilt was completely removed.
I asked: Lord, how did this happen?
He responded: It is because of your faith in Christ, whom you have not seen yet. Many years will pass before He comes in the flesh, so go on; your faith has healed you.
After hearing these words, I felt a strong desire for the well-being of my people, the Nephites, so I poured my entire soul out to God for them.
While I was earnestly praying, the Lord spoke to me again and said: I will visit your people based on their efforts to keep my commandments. I have given them this land, which is holy; I will not curse it unless it becomes iniquitous. I will visit your people as I promised, and their wrongdoing will cause them sorrow.
After hearing this, my faith in the Lord strengthened, and I prayed hard for my brethren, the Lamanites.
Eventually, after dedicating myself in prayer and effort, the Lord told me: I will grant your request because of your faith.
And this was my request: If my people, the Nephites, should turn to sin and be destroyed while the Lamanites remain, I asked that God would keep a record of my people, the Nephites, so it could be brought to the Lamanites one day, possibly leading them to salvation—
Because at that time, our efforts to bring them back to the true faith seemed hopeless. They were fiercely determined to destroy our records and us, along with all our traditions.
Knowing that God could protect our records, I continually cried out to Him, as He had promised that anything asked in faith in the name of Christ would be given.
I believed and requested that God preserve our records, and He assured me that He would bring them to the Lamanites in His own time.
I felt sure it would happen according to the promise He made, and my soul found peace.
The Lord told me: Your ancestors also asked me for this; it will happen according to their faith, which is just like yours.
So I began to move among the Nephites, prophesying about future events and sharing what I had learned and seen.
I can testify that the Nephites earnestly tried to help the Lamanites return to faith in God, but our efforts were in vain. Their hatred was strong, and they had become wild, aggressive, and bloodthirsty, engaged in idolatry and immorality, living off wild animals, camping out in the wilderness, wearing simple clothing, and focusing on hunting. Many of them ate only raw meat and constantly sought to destroy us.
In contrast, the Nephites cultivated the land, grew various grains and fruits, tended herds and flocks, and raised all kinds of cattle, goats, and horses.
There were many prophets among us, but the people were stubborn and hard to lead.
The messages we preached were always severe, warning of wars, conflicts, destruction, and repeatedly reminding them of death, eternity, and God’s power, trying to keep them aware of the Lord. I believe that only such strong and clear warnings could prevent their rapid descent into destruction. And I write about them in this way.
In my lifetime, I witnessed many battles between the Nephites and the Lamanites.
As I grew older, I realized that it had been one hundred seventy-nine years since our father Lehi left Jerusalem.
I understood that I would soon die. I was inspired by God to preach and share the truth about Christ. I have declared this throughout my life and found joy in it more than anything worldly.
Now I am about to rest with my Redeemer because I know that with Him, I will find peace. I look forward to the day when my mortal body will become immortal, and I will stand before Him, seeing His face with joy. He will say to me: Come, you are blessed; a place has been prepared for you among my Father’s many homes. Amen.
