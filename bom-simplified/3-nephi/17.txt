When Jesus finished speaking, he looked around at the crowd and told them that his time was near.
He could tell they were struggling to understand everything he had to say, which had been given to him by the Father.
So, he told them to return home, think carefully about his messages, and ask God in his name for understanding, preparing themselves for his return the next day.
He mentioned that he would be going to the Father and also to reveal himself to the lost tribes of Israel, reminding them that the Father knows exactly where they are.
After saying this, Jesus looked at the crowd again and saw they were crying, staring at him as if they wanted him to stay longer.
He expressed his deep compassion for them.
He asked if anyone among them was sick and invited them to come forward. He offered to heal those who were lame, blind, disabled, or suffering in any way, saying he felt deep mercy for them.
He sensed that they wanted to see what he had accomplished for their brethren in Jerusalem, and he observed that their faith was enough for him to heal them.
So, everyone in the crowd, united in purpose, came forward bringing their sick and afflicted, and he healed every one of them as they arrived.
Both those who had been healed and those who were whole bowed down at his feet in worship, while many from the crowd kissed his feet, bathing them with tears.
Then he instructed that their little children should be brought to him.
The people brought their children and placed them on the ground around him, while Jesus stood in the center. The crowd made space for all the children.
When all the children were gathered around, Jesus commanded the crowd to kneel on the ground.
As they knelt, Jesus felt troubled within himself and expressed his concern over the wickedness among the people of Israel.
After saying this, he knelt down and prayed to the Father. The content of his prayer was beyond what could be written down, and those who heard him bore witness to it.
This is how they recorded it: No one has ever seen or heard anything as wonderful as what we witnessed Jesus discussing with the Father.
Nothing can adequately describe or write about the greatness of what we saw and heard from Jesus, and no heart can grasp the immense joy that filled us while he prayed for us.
When Jesus finished praying, he stood up, but the crowd was so overwhelmed with joy that they could barely contain themselves.
Then he spoke to them and told them to get up.
They stood from the ground, and he said: You are blessed because of your faith. Now, my joy is complete.
After saying this, he cried, and the crowd noticed. He took each child one by one, blessed them, and prayed to the Father on their behalf.
After this, he cried again;
He addressed the crowd, telling them to look at their little ones.
As they turned their gaze upward, they saw the heavens opening, and angels descending from on high, appearing to be surrounded by fire. The angels came down and surrounded the children, and were encircled by fire as they ministered to them.
The crowd witnessed this and testified to it; they knew their accounts were true because each person experienced it firsthand. There were about two thousand five hundred individuals present, including men, women, and children.
