A day is coming that will be as hot as a furnace; all the proud and everyone who does wrong will be like dry chaff; that day will consume them completely, says the Lord of Hosts, leaving nothing but ashes.
But for those who respect my name, the Son of Righteousness will rise, bringing healing to them, and they will grow strong and well-fed like young calves in a barn.
You will trample on the wicked, for they will be reduced to ashes beneath your feet on the day I carry this out, says the Lord of Hosts.
Donâ€™t forget the laws of Moses, my servant, which I commanded him at Horeb for all of Israel, along with the rules and judgments.
Look, I will send the prophet Elijah to you before the arrival of that great and terrible day of the Lord;
And he will help restore the relationships between fathers and children, and between children and their fathers, otherwise I will come and bring destruction upon the earth.
