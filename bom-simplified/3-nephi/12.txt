When Jesus finished speaking, he addressed Nephi and the others he had chosen; there were twelve of them who had been given the ability and authority to baptize. He raised his hand to the crowd and exclaimed: You are blessed if you listen to the words of these twelve I have chosen to serve you; I have given them the power to baptize you with water, and after that, I will baptize you with fire and the Holy Ghost. So you are blessed if you believe in me and are baptized after seeing me and knowing who I am.
Moreover, more blessed are those who believe your words because you will testify that you have seen me and know that I am. Yes, blessed are those who believe what you say, who come to me with great humility to be baptized, for they will be touched by fire and the Holy Ghost, and their sins will be forgiven.
Yes, blessed are the humble who come to me, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
And again, blessed are those who grieve, for they will find comfort.
And blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.
And blessed are those who strive for righteousness, for they will be filled with the Holy Ghost.
And blessed are the compassionate, for they will receive compassion.
And blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
And blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
And blessed are those who suffer for my name’s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
And blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, or say all kinds of false things about you because of me;
For you will have great joy and be very glad, for your reward in heaven will be great; this is how they treated the prophets who lived before you.
Truly, I tell you, I have made you to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its taste, how can it be salty again? It’s no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and walked on by people.
Truly, I tell you, I have made you to be the light for this people. A city on a hill can’t be hidden.
Do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl? No, they put it on a stand so it gives light to all in the house;
So let your light shine in front of others so they can see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
Don’t think I came to abolish the law or the prophets. I did not come to abolish but to fulfill;
For truly I tell you, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will disappear from the law until everything is accomplished.
I have given you the commandments from my Father, so that you will believe in me, repent of your sins, and come to me with a broken heart and a humble spirit. You have the commandments before you, and the law is fulfilled.
Therefore, come to me to be saved; for truly I tell you, unless you keep my commandments given to you now, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard it said in ancient times, that you shall not kill, and anyone who kills will be judged by God;
But I say to you, anyone who is angry with a brother will also face judgment. And anyone who insults a brother will be brought before the council; and anyone who calls someone a fool is in danger of hellfire.
So, if you come to me and want to come closer but remember that your brother has something against you—
Go and make peace with your brother first, then come to me with sincere purpose, and I will accept you.
Make peace with your opponent quickly while you are still with them, or you might end up in court, and then you’ll be sentenced to prison.
Truly, I say to you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. And when you are in prison, can you pay even one penny? Truly, I say to you, no.
You have heard it said that you shall not commit adultery;
But I say to you, anyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery in their heart.
I give you this commandment: do not let such thoughts enter your heart;
For it is better for you to deny yourself these desires, taking up your cross, than to be thrown into hell.
It has been written that if you put away your wife, you must give her a certificate of divorce.
Truly, I tell you, anyone who puts away their wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery; and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Again, it is written, you shall not break your oath, but must fulfill your vows to the Lord;
But truly, I tell you, do not swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;
Nor by the earth, for it is God’s footstool;
Nor should you swear by your head, because you cannot change even one hair from black to white;
Instead, let your yes be yes and your no be no; anything beyond this is evil.
And it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; instead, if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek as well;
And if someone takes you to court to take away your shirt, let them have your coat too;
And if anyone forces you to go a mile, go with them two miles.
Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn away from those who want to borrow from you.
It is also written that you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy;
But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you;
So you can be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes the sun rise on both the good and the evil.
Therefore, everything from old times that was under the law is fulfilled in me.
The old ways are gone, and everything has become new.
So, I ask that you strive for perfection just as I or your Father in heaven is perfect.
