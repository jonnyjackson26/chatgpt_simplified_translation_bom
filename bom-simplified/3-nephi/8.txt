A series of natural disasters like storms, earthquakes, fires, and whirlwinds demonstrate the significance of Christ's crucifixion—many people perish—darkness envelops the land for three days—those who survive lament their situation.
Now, according to our records, which we trust to be accurate, a righteous man maintained the records. He performed numerous miracles in Jesus's name, and no one could perform miracles in that name unless they were completely free from sin.
At this point, if this man didn't err in tracking our time, the thirty-third year has passed.
People began to earnestly look for the sign mentioned by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite, specifically the sign indicating a period of darkness lasting three days over the land.
Doubts and debates arose among the people, despite having witnessed so many signs.
In the thirty-fourth year, during the first month, on the fourth day, a massive storm arose, unlike anything known in the land before.
A fierce and terrible tempest came; the thunder was so powerful it shook the entire earth, as if it might break apart.
There were sharp flashes of lightning, unprecedented in all the land.
The city of Zarahemla caught fire.
The city of Moroni sank beneath the sea, and its people drowned.
The land where the city of Moronihah stood was lifted up, becoming a large mountain in its place.
A massive and terrible destruction occurred in the southern lands.
But a greater and more horrible destruction unfolded in the northern lands; the landscape was completely altered due to the storms, whirlwinds, thunder, lightning, and an immense shaking of the earth.
The roads were broken, and smooth paths were ruined, turning many flat areas into rough terrain.
Numerous significant cities sank, many were burned, and countless others trembled until their buildings collapsed, killing their inhabitants and leaving the places deserted.
Some cities remained, but they were severely damaged, and many lives were lost in them.
Some people were swept away by the whirlwind; their fate is unknown, except that they were taken away.
The entire earth's surface became scarred and disfigured due to the storms, thunder, lightning, and the shaking of the ground.
The rocks split apart, breaking into fragments and creating seams and cracks all over the land.
When the thunder, lightning, storm, tempest, and earthquakes finally stopped—lasting roughly three hours, though some claimed it lasted longer—all these terrifying events occurred in this short time—darkness fell over the land.
A thick darkness covered the entire land, so that those who remained standing could feel the oppressive darkness around them.
No light could be found because of the darkness; there were no candles or torches, and even dry wood could not be lit, leaving them in total darkness.
No light was visible at all—no fire, no flicker, no sun, no moon, no stars—such was the intensity of the darkness that covered the land.
This lasted for three days without any light; great mourning, wailing, and tears filled the people continually, echoing the intense groans among them due to the darkness and the devastation that had struck.
In one location, they cried out, regretting, “If only we had repented before this terrible day, then our brothers might have been saved and not perished in the great city of Zarahemla.”
In another place, they mourned, crying out, “If only we had repented before this dreadful day and not hurt and rejected the prophets, our mothers, daughters, and children could have been spared, and not buried in the great city of Moronihah.” The wailing of the people was immense and horrifying.
