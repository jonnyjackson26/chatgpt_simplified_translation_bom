The ninety-fifth year came to an end, and the people started to forget the miraculous signs and wonders they had witnessed. They became less impressed by heavenly signs, which hardening their hearts and blinding their minds, led them to doubt everything they had heard and seen.
They created false ideas in their hearts, claiming that these miracles were performed by humans and the devil's power, intended to mislead and deceive them. This allowed Satan to regain control over the people's hearts, blinding them to the truth and leading them to believe that Christ's teachings were foolish and meaningless.
Consequently, the people grew stronger in their wickedness and sinful acts. They no longer believed that any more signs or wonders would be shown to them. Meanwhile, Satan roamed about, tempting the people and urging them to commit great evils throughout the land.
Thus passed the ninety-sixth, ninety-seventh, ninety-eighth, and ninety-ninth years;
And a hundred years had gone by since the time of King Mosiah, who ruled over the Nephite people.
It had been six hundred and nine years since Lehi left Jerusalem.
Nine years had passed from when the prophetic sign indicating that Christ would come into the world was given.
Now, the Nephites started counting their years from this event, or from Christ's coming; thus, nine years had elapsed.
Nephi, who was the father of Nephi responsible for the records, did not return to Zarahemla and could not be found anywhere in the land.
Despite much preaching and prophecy trying to guide them, the people continued in their wickedness; thus, the tenth year also passed, followed by another year of iniquity.
In the thirteenth year, wars and disputes began to break out across the land because the Gadianton robbers had become numerous, killing many of the people, destroying cities, and spreading death and destruction throughout the land. It became necessary for everyone, both Nephites and Lamanites, to take up arms against them.
All the converted Lamanites joined forces with the Nephites, compelled to arm themselves to protect their lives, women, and children from the Gadianton robbers, and to defend their rights, church, worship, freedom, and liberty.
Before the thirteenth year was over, the Nephites faced the threat of total destruction due to this intense conflict.
Those Lamanites who had allied with the Nephites were categorized with them;
Their curse was lifted, and their skin became white like the Nephites;
Their young men and daughters became very fair, and they were counted among the Nephites, adopting the name Nephites. Thus, the thirteenth year came to an end.
At the start of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the Nephite people intensified; however, the Nephites managed to push the robbers back into the mountains and their hidden places.
Thus, the fourteenth year came to a close. In the fifteenth year, the robbers again attacked the Nephites. Due to the Nephites' wickedness, numerous conflicts, and divisions among themselves, the Gadianton robbers gained several advantages.
Thus the fifteenth year also ended, and the people faced great hardships. The threat of destruction hung over them, ready to strike because of their sins.
