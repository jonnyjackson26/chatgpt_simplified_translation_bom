Jesus declares that the teachings of Moses have been completed in Him—The Nephites are the other flock He spoke of in Jerusalem—Because of wrongdoing, the Lord’s people in Jerusalem do not recognize the scattered Israelites. Around A.D. 34.
After Jesus finished speaking, He looked around at the crowd and said: Look, you have heard what I taught before I went back to my Father; so, whoever remembers my teachings and acts on them will be raised at the final judgment.
Once Jesus finished these words, He noticed that some people were amazed and curious about His thoughts on the law of Moses; they didn’t understand that the old ways were gone and everything had been made new.
He told them: Don’t be surprised that I said the old ways are gone and everything is new.
Listen, I am telling you that the law given to Moses has been completed.
I am the one who gave the law, and I made a covenant with the people of Israel; therefore, because I fulfill the law, it has come to an end.
I do not eliminate the prophets; every prophecy not fulfilled in me will indeed come to pass.
And when I say old things have passed, I am not doing away with what has been said about future events.
Look, the covenant I made with my people is still partially unfulfilled; however, the law given to Moses finds its fulfillment in me.
I am the law and the light. Turn to me, endure in faith, and you will live; for those who endure will receive eternal life.
I have given you my commandments; so, keep them. This is what the law and the prophets are about, for they truly spoke of me.
After Jesus spoke these words, He addressed the twelve disciples He had chosen:
You are my followers; you are a light to this people, who are the remnants of the house of Joseph.
And this is your promised land; the Father has given it to you.
At no time did the Father instruct me to tell your brothers in Jerusalem about it.
Neither has the Father commanded me to inform them about the other tribes of Israel that were led away.
This is what the Father has commanded me: 
I have other sheep that are not part of this group; I must bring them too, and they will recognize my voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd.
However, due to their stubbornness and lack of belief, they did not understand my message; hence, I was told not to say more about this matter to them.
But truly, I tell you, the Father commanded me and I share it with you that you were separated from them because of their wrongdoing; it is their wrongdoing that makes them unaware of you.
I also tell you again that the other tribes are separated from them by the Father; and it is because of their wrongdoing that they do not know about them.
I assure you that you are the ones I referred to when I said: I have other sheep that are not part of this group; I must bring them too, and they will recognize my voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd.
They didn’t understand me because they thought I was talking about the Gentiles; they didn’t grasp that the Gentiles would be converted through their preaching.
They didn’t get that I said they would hear my voice, nor did they understand that the Gentiles wouldn’t hear my voice unless it was through the Holy Ghost.
But, look, you have both heard my voice and seen me; you are my sheep, and you are counted among those the Father has given to me.
