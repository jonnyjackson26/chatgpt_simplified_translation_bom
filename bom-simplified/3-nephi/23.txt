You should really take the time to look into these matters. I strongly encourage you to search carefully, because the words of Isaiah are incredibly significant.
He certainly spoke about everything related to my people, the house of Israel; so it makes sense that he would also speak to the Gentiles.
Everything he said has happened and will happen just as he proclaimed.
So pay attention to what I have said; write down the things I’ve shared with you, and in the right time and according to the Father’s will, this information will be shared with the Gentiles.
Anyone who listens to my words, repents, and is baptized will be saved. Look to the prophets, as many testify about these truths.
When Jesus finished speaking these words, he addressed them again. After explaining all the scriptures they had received, he told them: “Now, I want you to write down other scriptures that you don’t currently have.”
He then told Nephi: “Bring forward the record you have kept.”
When Nephi presented the records and placed them before Jesus, he looked at them and said:
“Truly, I instructed my servant Samuel, the Lamanite, to testify to this people that on the day when the Father glorifies his name in me, many saints will rise from the dead and show themselves to many, ministering to them. Did this not happen?”
The disciples replied: “Yes, Lord, Samuel prophesied exactly what you said, and it all came true.”
Jesus then asked them: “Why have you not written about this, that many saints rose, appeared to many, and ministered to them?”
Nephi remembered that this had not been recorded.
Then Jesus commanded that it be written down; so it was inscribed just as he instructed.
After Jesus had explained all the scriptures that they had written together, he instructed them to teach what he had revealed to them.
