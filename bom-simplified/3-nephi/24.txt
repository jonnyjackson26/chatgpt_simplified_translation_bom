The Lord’s messenger will prepare the way for the Second Coming—Christ will sit in judgment—Israel is commanded to pay tithes and offerings—A book of remembrance is kept—Compare Malachi 3. About A.D. 34.
He instructed them to record the words the Father had given to Malachi, which he would share with them. After they were written down, he explained them. Here are the words he shared: The Father said to Malachi—Look, I will send my messenger to prepare the way for me, and the Lord you are looking for will come to his temple unexpectedly, even the messenger of the covenant that you find joy in; yes, he will come, says the Lord of Hosts.
But who can endure the day of his coming? Who will stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s fire and like soap used for cleansing.
He will act as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will cleanse the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, so that they can offer the Lord offerings that are righteous.
Then the offerings from Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, just like in the past and previous years.
I will approach you for judgment; I will be a quick witness against sorcerers, adulterers, false swearers, those who cheat their workers, widows, orphans, those who mistreat outsiders, and those who do not respect me, says the Lord of Hosts.
For I am the Lord, and I do not change; that is why you, the descendants of Jacob, are not destroyed.
From the days of your ancestors, you have turned away from my commandments and have not followed them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of Hosts. But you ask: How can we return?
Can a man steal from God? Yet you have stolen from me. You ask: How have we stolen from you? In tithes and offerings.
You are under a curse because you have stolen from me, this entire nation.
Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, so there may be food in my house; test me in this, says the Lord of Hosts, and see if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings so great that you will not have enough space to receive them.
I will protect your crops, and insects will not destroy the produce of your land, and your vines will not lose their fruit before harvest, says the Lord of Hosts.
All nations will recognize you as blessed, for you will be a delightful land, says the Lord of Hosts.
Your words have been harsh against me, says the Lord. Yet you ask: What have we said against you?
You have said: Serving God is pointless, and what do we gain by keeping his commands and walking in sadness before the Lord of Hosts?
Now we find the proud happy; yes, those who do evil seem to prosper; even those who challenge God escape trouble.
Then those who feared the Lord spoke frequently to one another, and the Lord listened and heard; a book of remembrance was written in his presence for those who feared the Lord and thought about his name.
They will be mine, says the Lord of Hosts, on that day when I gather my treasures; I will protect them like a father protects his son who serves him.
Then you will return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between those who serve God and those who do not.
