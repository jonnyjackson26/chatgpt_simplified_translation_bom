The chief judge was killed, the government fell apart, and the people split into tribes—Jacob, an anti-Christ, became the leader of a secret group—Nephi preached about turning back to God and trusting in Christ—Angels helped him every day, and he even brought his brother back to life—Many people repented and were baptized. About A.D. 30–33.
Now look, I will show you that they did not make a king for the land; but in this same year, the thirtieth year, they did kill the chief judge on the judgment seat.
And the people turned against each other; they separated into tribes, with each person following their family, relatives, and friends; thus, they destroyed the government.
Each tribe chose a leader for themselves; so they became tribes with their own leaders.
Now see, there was no one among them who didn’t have a large family and many friends; therefore, their tribes became very large.
All of this happened, and there were no wars among them yet; all this wrongdoing came upon the people because they gave in to Satan.
The rules of the government were destroyed because of the secret group formed by friends and relatives of those who killed the prophets.
This caused great turmoil in the land, so much so that almost all of the more righteous people became wicked; there were only a few good men left among them.
And thus six years went by since most of the people had turned away from their goodness, like a dog returning to its vomit, or a pig wallowing in the mud.
Now this secret group, which brought so much evil upon the people, gathered together and appointed a man they called Jacob.
They named him their king; so he became the king of this evil group, and he was one of the most prominent voices against the prophets who preached about Jesus.
It happened that they were not as numerous as the tribes of the people, who were united together unless it was their leaders who established their laws, each according to their tribe; still, they were enemies. Even though they were not a righteous people, they united in their hatred of those who made a pact to destroy the government.
So, Jacob, seeing that their enemies outnumbered them, he being the king of the group, commanded his people to flee to the northernmost part of the land, to build a kingdom for themselves, until they could be joined by defectors, (for he flattered them that many would join them) and they could become strong enough to fight against the tribes of the people; and they did.
Their movement was so swift that nothing could stop them until they left the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the happenings with the people of Nephi.
In the thirty-first year, they were divided into tribes, each according to their family, relatives, and friends; yet they agreed not to fight each other; but they were not united in their laws and ways of governing, which were based on the preferences of their chiefs and leaders. They did set very strict laws to prevent one tribe from invading another, so to some extent they had peace in the land; yet their hearts were turned away from the Lord their God, and they stoned the prophets and cast them out.
And it happened that Nephi—having been visited by angels and the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, being an eyewitness, and having the power to know about the mission of Christ, and also witnessing their quick return from righteousness to their wickedness and terrible acts;
Therefore, saddened by their hard-heartedness and mental blindness—went among them that same year and boldly began to testify about repentance and forgiveness of sins through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
He taught them many things; the full account cannot be written, and part of it would not be enough, so it’s not recorded in this book. Nephi taught with power and great authority.
The people became angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it was impossible for them to disbelieve his words, because his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ was so great that angels helped him every day.
In the name of Jesus, he cast out demons and evil spirits; and he even raised his brother from the dead, after he had been stoned and died at the hands of the people.
The people witnessed this and were angry with him because of his power; he performed many more miracles before them, in the name of Jesus.
So the thirty-first year passed, and there were only a few who turned to the Lord; but those who did turn to Him genuinely showed the people that they had experienced the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, whom they believed in.
And those who had demons cast out and were healed of their sicknesses and weaknesses truly demonstrated to the people that they had been affected by the Spirit of God and had been healed; they also showed signs and performed some miracles among the people.
Thus passed the thirty-second year. Nephi cried out to the people at the start of the thirty-third year; and he preached to them about repentance and forgiveness of sins.
Now I want you to remember that everyone who repented was baptized in water.
Therefore, Nephi ordained men for this ministry, so that anyone who approached them would be baptized in water, as a witness and testimony before God, and to the people, that they had repented and received forgiveness for their sins.
At the beginning of this year, many were baptized in repentance; and thus the majority of the year passed.
