Jesus has other followers who are not from this land, not from Jerusalem, and not from its surrounding areas where I have ministered.
These people I’m referring to haven't yet heard my message, nor have I shown myself to them at any time.
However, I have received a command from the Father to go to them, so they can hear my voice and be counted among my followers, creating one united group with one leader; therefore, I will go and reveal myself to them.
I instruct you to write down these words after I am gone, so that if my people in Jerusalem, who have seen and been with me during my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name to know about you through the Holy Ghost, and also about the other tribes they aren’t aware of, then the things you write will be preserved and revealed to the Gentiles. This way, through the fullness given to the Gentiles, the remaining descendants of Israel, who are scattered around the world due to their lack of faith, can come to know me, their Redeemer.
Then I will gather them from all corners of the earth; I will fulfill the covenant the Father made with the house of Israel.
The Gentiles are blessed because of their faith in me and in the Holy Ghost, which testifies to them about me and the Father.
Look, because the Gentiles believe in me, the Father says, and due to the disbelief among you, O house of Israel, in the latter days, the truth will reach the Gentiles, and the fullness of these things will be revealed to them.
But woe to the unbelieving Gentiles, says the Father, for even though they have come to this land and have scattered my people, who belong to the house of Israel, my people have been driven away from among them and have been trampled upon.
Because of the Father’s mercy toward the Gentiles, and the judgments He has placed upon my people—after causing my people of Israel to suffer, be afflicted, killed, pushed away, hated, and scorned among others—
The Father commands me to say: At that time, when the Gentiles go against my gospel, reject its fullness, and become proud above all nations and people, and fill themselves with lies, deceit, wickedness, hypocrisy, murders, manipulative practices, sexual immorality, and secret evils; if they engage in all these actions and reject the fullness of my gospel, the Father says, I will remove the fullness of my gospel from among them.
Then I will remember my covenant with my people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my gospel to them.
I will make it clear to you, O house of Israel, that the Gentiles will not dominate you; I will keep my covenant with you, O house of Israel, and you will come to understand the fullness of my gospel.
But if the Gentiles repent and return to me, the Father says, they will be counted among my people, O house of Israel.
I will not allow my people, who belong to the house of Israel, to be trampled upon by them, says the Father.
However, if they refuse to turn to me and listen to my voice, I will allow my people, O house of Israel, to pass through among them, be trampled down, and become like salt that has lost its flavor, which is only good to be thrown out and walked on by my people, O house of Israel.
Truly, truly, I tell you, this is the command from the Father to me—that I should give this land to this people as their inheritance.
Then the words of the prophet Isaiah will come to pass, which say:
Your watchmen will lift their voices together in song, for they will see eye to eye when the Lord restores Zion.
Shout for joy, sing together, you desolate areas of Jerusalem; for the Lord has comforted his people and has redeemed Jerusalem.
The Lord has revealed his holy power to all nations; and everyone on earth will witness the salvation of God.
