Jesus miraculously提供 bread and wine and once again shares the sacrament with the people. The remaining descendants of Jacob will learn about the Lord their God and inherit the Americas. Jesus is a prophet similar to Moses, and the Nephites are considered children of the prophets. Other followers of the Lord will be gathered to Jerusalem. This event occurred around A.D. 34.
He instructed the crowd to stop praying out loud, but also told his disciples to keep praying quietly in their hearts.
He told them to get up and stand on their feet, and they did so.
Then, he broke the bread again, blessed it, and gave it to the disciples to eat.
After they ate, he instructed them to break the bread and share it with the crowd.
Once they provided the bread to the crowd, he also offered them wine to drink and commanded that they share that as well.
The disciples had not brought any bread or wine, nor did the crowd have any.
But he truly provided them with bread to eat and wine to drink.
He told them: "Whoever eats this bread is receiving a part of my body for their spirit; and whoever drinks this wine is receiving a part of my blood for their spirit; and their spirit will never feel hunger or thirst, but will be satisfied."
Once everyone had eaten and drunk, they were filled with the Spirit and cried out in unison, giving glory to Jesus, whom they could both see and hear.
After they had praised Jesus, he said to them: "Now I complete the command that the Father has given me concerning this people, who are the remnants of the house of Israel."
"You remember that I told you, that when the words of Isaiah would be fulfilled—look, they are written down, you have them before you, so search them.
And I assure you, that when they are fulfilled, the promise made by the Father to his people, O house of Israel, will also be fulfilled."
"Then, the remnants who are scattered across the earth will be gathered from the east and the west, the south and the north; and they will come to know the Lord their God, who has saved them."
"And the Father has instructed me to give this land to you as your inheritance."
"I tell you, if the Gentiles do not repent after receiving blessings and after having scattered my people—"
"Then you, the remnants of the house of Jacob, will go among them; and you will be in their midst, who will be numerous; you will be like a lion among the beasts of the forest, and like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, as he passes through, crushes and tears apart, with no one able to rescue."
"Your hand will be raised against your enemies, and all your foes will be cut off."
"I will gather my people together like a farmer gathers his harvest into the barn."
"I will make my people, with whom the Father has made a covenant, strong and powerful. I will give you strength and the ability to defeat many, and I will dedicate their gains and resources to the Lord of all the earth. And behold, I am the one who will do this."
"And it will happen, says the Father, that on that day, my justice will remain over them; unless they repent, it will fall on them, says the Father, even upon all the Gentile nations."
"And it will come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of Israel."
"And behold, I will establish this people in this land, fulfilling the promise I made to your father Jacob; and it will be a New Jerusalem. The powers of heaven will be present among this people; in fact, I will be among you."
"Behold, I am the one Moses spoke of, saying: 'The Lord your God will raise up a prophet from among your brothers, like me; you must listen to whatever he tells you. Anyone who does not listen to that prophet will be cut off from the people.'"
"Truly, I say to you, indeed, all the prophets from Samuel onward have borne witness of me."
"Behold, you are children of the prophets; you belong to the house of Israel; and you are part of the covenant that the Father made with your ancestors, saying to Abraham: 'Through your descendants, all the families of the earth will be blessed.'"
"The Father has raised me up first to you and sent me to bless you by turning each one of you away from your sins; and this is because you are the children of the covenant—"
"After you have been blessed, then the Father fulfills the covenant he made with Abraham, saying: 'In your seed, all the families of the earth will be blessed'—this will lead to the outpouring of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, a blessing that will make them mighty, resulting in the scattering of my people, O house of Israel."
"They will become a scourge to the people of this land. However, after they receive the fullness of my gospel, if they harden their hearts against me, I will return their wrongdoings upon their own heads, says the Father."
"And I will remember the covenant I have made with my people; I have promised them that I would gather them in my own time, that I would restore to them the land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is Jerusalem, the promised land to them forever, says the Father."
"And it will happen that the time will come when the fullness of my gospel will be preached to them."
"They will believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and will pray to the Father in my name."
"Then their watchmen will shout together, and with their voices they will sing, for they will see eye to eye."
"Then the Father will gather them again, and grant them Jerusalem as their inheritance."
"They will rejoice and shout—Sing together, you desolate places of Jerusalem; for the Father has comforted his people; he has redeemed Jerusalem."
"The Father has revealed himself to all nations; and all parts of the earth will see the salvation of the Father; and the Father and I are united."
"Then what is written will occur: 'Awake, wake up anew, and put on your strength, O Zion; dress in your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for from now on, the uncircumcised and unclean will no longer enter you.'"
"Shake off the dust; rise up and sit down, O Jerusalem; free yourself from the chains around your neck, O captive daughter of Zion."
"This is what the Lord says: 'You have sold yourselves for nothing, and you will be redeemed without paying any money.'"
"Truly, I say to you, my people will come to know my name; yes, on that day they will know that I am the one who speaks."
"And then they will say: 'How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace; who bring glad tidings of good, who announce salvation; who say to Zion: Your God reigns!'"
"Then a call will spread: 'Get away, get away, leave that place, do not touch anything unclean; leave the midst of her; be clean, you who carry the vessels of the Lord.'"
"You will not leave in haste or flee; for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your protector from behind."
"Behold, my servant will act wisely; he will be lifted up, honored, and exceedingly exalted."
"Many will be amazed at you—his appearance marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—"
"So will he sprinkle many nations; kings will shut their mouths because they will see what had not been told to them; and they will understand what they had not heard."
"Truly, I say unto you, all these things will surely happen, just as the Father has commanded me. Then this covenant that the Father has made with his people will be fulfilled; and Jerusalem will once again be inhabited by my people, and it will be their inheritance."
