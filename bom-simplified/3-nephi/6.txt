The Nephites thrived—pride, wealth, and social classes emerged—The Church faced deep divisions—Satan led the people to outright rebellion—Many prophets called for repentance and were killed—Their murderers conspired to seize control of the government. About A.D. 26–30.
In the twenty-sixth year, the Nephite people returned to their homes, with every person bringing along their family, livestock, horses, cattle, and all their belongings.
They hadn’t consumed all their supplies, so they took whatever food they hadn’t eaten, including all types of grain, and their gold and silver, returning to their lands and possessions in both the northern and southern regions.
They gave land to the robbers who made a pact to maintain peace and wished to remain Lamanites, granting them enough land based on their numbers so they could support themselves through their work; this helped to establish peace throughout the land.
They began to thrive and grow; the twenty-sixth and seventh years passed with great order in the land, and they had laws rooted in fairness and justice.
There was nothing stopping the people from continuing to prosper, except for the possibility of their own wrongdoing.
The leaders responsible for this peace were Gidgiddoni, the judge Lachoneus, and others appointed to lead.
Many new cities were built, and several old cities were repaired.
They constructed numerous highways and roads connecting cities and different areas of the land.
Thus, the twenty-eighth year ended with continued peace among the people.
However, in the twenty-ninth year, arguments began to arise among the people; some became prideful and boastful due to their significant wealth, even leading to severe persecution.
There were many traders, lawyers, and officials in the land.
The people started to be categorized based on their wealth and education; some were ignorant due to poverty while others gained extensive education because of their riches.
Some became arrogant, while others remained very humble; some retaliated to insults, while others chose to endure insults and persecution with humility and repentance before God.
This led to significant inequality throughout the land, causing the Church to begin to fall apart; by the thirtieth year, the Church was nearly nonexistent throughout the land, except for a few Lamanites who had embraced the true faith and steadfastly adhered to it, diligently keeping God's commandments.
The root of this wickedness among the people was that Satan had great influence, inciting them to commit all sorts of wrongdoings, filling them with pride, and tempting them to seek power, authority, wealth, and fleeting pleasures.
Satan led the people’s hearts away from righteousness, which is why their peace lasted only a few years.
At the beginning of the thirtieth year, the people, having long been swayed by the devil's temptations to commit various sins, found themselves in a state of dreadful wickedness.
They were not ignorant of their sins, as they understood God’s will for them, having received teachings about it; therefore, they intentionally chose to rebel against God.
This was during the time of Lachoneus, the son of Lachoneus, who succeeded his father and governed the people that year.
Men inspired by heaven began preaching and boldly denouncing the sins of the people, declaring the redemption that the Lord would bring for his people, which was the resurrection of Christ, and they testified about his suffering and death.
Many people grew very angry with those who spoke about these matters; those who were upset mostly included the chief judges, former high priests, and lawyers; in fact, all lawyers were angry at those who testified.
No lawyer, judge, or high priest had the authority to condemn anyone to death without the governor's approval.
Many who boldly testified about Christ were secretly put to death by the judges, and their deaths went unnoticed by the governor until after they had died.
This practice violated the laws of the land, which stated that no one could be put to death unless authorized by the governor.
Thus, a complaint was raised in Zarahemla against the judges who wrongfully condemned the prophets to death in violation of the law.
They were brought before the judge to be tried for their crimes as set forth by the law established by the people.
These judges had many friends and connections, while nearly all the lawyers and high priests joined forces with the families of those judges about to be tried.
They entered into a pact with one another, similar to an ancient covenant that was associated with the devil, to unite against anything good.
Consequently, they combined forces against the people of the Lord, agreeing to eliminate them and protect those guilty of murder from justice as mandated by the law.
They openly defied the law and the rights of their country, making an agreement to overthrow the governor and establish a king, so that the land would no longer be free but be ruled by kings.
