Jesus explains everything from start to finish—little children say amazing things that can't be documented—Everyone in the Church of Christ shares everything.
After Jesus shared this, he explained it to the crowd, covering all topics, both large and small.
He said: These scriptures that you didn't have before are what the Father instructed me to give you; it was wise for Him to ensure they would be handed down to future generations.
He explained everything from the beginning until his glorious return—this includes everything that would happen on earth until everything is melted away with intense heat, and the earth rolls up like a scroll, with the heavens and the earth passing away.
And this includes the final day when everyone, from all backgrounds and languages, will stand before God to be judged based on their actions, whether good or evil.
If their deeds are good, they will be resurrected to everlasting life; and if evil, to a resurrection of condemnation, with both judgments being equal, based on the mercy, justice, and holiness found in Christ, who existed before the world.
There isn't enough space in this book to write even one percent of all that Jesus truly taught the people;
However, the plates of Nephi have most of his teachings recorded.
I have written a smaller selection of these teachings so that they can be returned to this people from the Gentiles, according to what Jesus said.
When they receive these teachings, which are necessary for their faith, if they believe these, then greater truths will be revealed to them.
But if they refuse to believe these, then those greater truths will be kept from them, leading to their condemnation.
I was about to write everything that was recorded on the plates of Nephi, but the Lord stopped me, saying: I will test my people's faith.
So I, Mormon, write what the Lord has commanded me. Now, I finish my words and continue with what I have been instructed to write.
I want you to know that the Lord truly taught the people for three days; afterwards, he continued to show himself to them often, breaking bread with them, blessing it, and sharing it.
Afterward, he taught and ministered to the children of the crowd, freeing their tongues, and they spoke to their fathers about amazing things, even greater than what he revealed to the adults, as he enabled them to express these.
The next day after he had ascended into heaven—after appearing to them a second time and returning to the Father, having healed everyone among them, from the sick and lame to the blind and deaf, as well as raising a man from the dead and showing his power, then ascending to the Father—
The following day, the crowd gathered again, and they saw and heard these children; even babies opened their mouths and spoke wonderful things that no one was allowed to write down.
The disciples chosen by Jesus began to baptize and teach everyone who came to them; those who were baptized in Jesus' name received the Holy Ghost.
Many of them saw and experienced things that were indescribable and couldn’t be legally recorded.
They taught and ministered to each other, sharing all things in common, treating one another justly.
They did everything just as Jesus had instructed them.
Those who were baptized in Jesus' name were called the Church of Christ.
