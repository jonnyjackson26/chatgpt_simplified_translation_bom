The publication of the Book of Mormon is proof that the Lord has started to gather Israel and keep His promises—Those who reject His revelations and gifts in these latter days will face consequences.
Pay attention, for when the Lord decides, in His wisdom, to share these messages with the Gentiles as He has promised, you can be sure that the agreement the Father made with the children of Israel, about bringing them back to their promised lands, is already beginning to happen.
You can trust that the Lord's words, delivered by holy prophets, will all come true; you shouldn't think that the Lord is delaying His return to the children of Israel.
Do not doubt in your hearts that these messages are empty, because the Lord will remember His promise to the people of Israel.
When you see these messages being shared among you, don’t dismiss the ways of the Lord, for His justice is powerful; know that if you disregard His actions, consequences will swiftly follow.
Woe to anyone who dismisses the works of the Lord; indeed, woe to anyone who denies Christ and what He has done!
Woe to anyone who rejects the revelations from the Lord, claiming that He is no longer guiding us through revelation, prophecy, gifts, speaking in tongues, healing, or the power of the Holy Spirit!
Woe to those who, in their pursuit of profit, claim that Jesus Christ cannot perform miracles, for those who do this will end up like the son of perdition, who received no mercy according to Christ’s words!
You should no longer mock or belittle the Jews or the remnant of Israel, for the Lord remembers His covenant with them, and He will act according to what He has promised.
Therefore, do not think you can change the course of the Lord's hand so that He won't execute judgment as He fulfills His promise to the house of Israel.
