Listen, you Gentiles, and pay attention to the words of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God. He has instructed me to speak to you, and He has commanded me to write these words, saying:
All you Gentiles should turn away from your sinful behaviors; repent of your wrong actions, your lies and deceit, your sexual immorality, your hidden sins, your idol worship, murders, misuse of priesthood, jealousy, conflicts, and from all your wickedness and sins. Come to me and be baptized in my name so that you can be forgiven for your sins and receive the Holy Spirit, allowing you to be counted among my people, who belong to the house of Israel.
