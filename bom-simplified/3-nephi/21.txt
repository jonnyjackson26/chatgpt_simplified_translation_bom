Israel will be brought back together when the Book of Mormon is revealed—The non-Israelite nations will find freedom in America—They will be saved if they have faith and follow Me; if not, they will face ruin—Israel will create a New Jerusalem, and the lost tribes will return. About A.D. 34.
I truly tell you, I'm giving you a sign so you can recognize when these events are about to happen—I'm going to gather my people, the house of Israel, from their long separation and re-establish my Zion among them;
And look, this is the sign I will provide you—truly, I say to you, when these things I’m telling you now, and those I will share later, revealed through the Holy Ghost given to you by the Father, are made known to the non-Israelites, they will learn about this group that is a remnant of Jacob’s house and about my people who will be scattered by them;
I truly say to you, when these things come to be known by them from the Father, they will come from the Father to you;
For it is wise in the Father to establish them in this land and set them up as a free people by His power, so that these things can reach a remnant of your descendants, fulfilling the covenant the Father has made with His people, the house of Israel;
So, when these miracles and the works that will happen among you in the future are brought forth by the non-Israelites to your descendants who will lose faith because of wickedness;
For it is necessary for the Father to work through the non-Israelites to demonstrate His power to them, so that if they do not harden their hearts, they may repent, come to me, be baptized in my name, and understand my true teachings, allowing them to be counted among my people, the house of Israel;
And when these events happen, your descendants will begin to understand these things—it will be a sign to them that the Father’s work has already started to fulfill the promise made to the house of Israel.
And when that day comes, it will be a time when kings will be silent, for they will see things that were never told to them and think about things they never heard.
For in that day, for My sake, the Father will perform a wonderful and remarkable work among them; and there will be people among them who will not believe it, even if someone explains it to them.
But behold, my servant's life will be under my protection; therefore, they will not harm him, though he may suffer because of them. Yet, I will heal him, for I will show them that my wisdom exceeds the devil’s tricks.
So, it will happen that whoever does not believe my words, which I, Jesus Christ, will have the Father cause to be shared with the non-Israelites, and whom He will empower to share them (just as Moses said), they will be cut off from my covenant people.
And my people—a remnant of Jacob—will be among the non-Israelites, yes, right in their midst, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among sheep, who, if he walks through, will trample and tear apart, and no one can rescue.
Their hand will be lifted up against their enemies, and all their foes will be cut off.
Yes, woe to the non-Israelites unless they repent; for the Father has said that in that day, He will remove your horses and destroy your chariots;
And I will destroy the cities of your land and tear down your strongholds;
And I will eradicate witchcraft from your land, and you will have no more soothsayers;
I will cut down your carved idols and your standing images, and you will no longer worship what you have created with your hands;
And I will uproot your groves from among you; thus, I will destroy your cities.
It will come to pass that all lying, deception, envy, strife, priesthood abuses, and immoral behaviors will be removed.
For it will happen, says the Father, that on that day, anyone who does not repent and come to my Beloved Son will be cut off from among my people, O house of Israel;
And I will bring wrath and judgment upon them, just as I would against the heathens, things they have never heard before.
But if they repent and listen to my words, and do not harden their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they will join in the covenant and be counted among the remnant of Jacob, to whom I have granted this land as their inheritance;
And they will help my people, the remnant of Jacob, and anyone from the house of Israel who comes, so that they can build a city that will be called the New Jerusalem.
And then they will help gather my people who are scattered throughout the land into the New Jerusalem.
Then the power of heaven will be among them; I will also dwell with them.
And then the Father’s work will start on that day when this gospel is preached to the remnant of this people. Truly, I say to you, on that day the Father’s work will begin among all the scattered people, including the lost tribes whom the Father has led away from Jerusalem.
Yes, the work will begin among all the dispersed of my people, with the Father preparing the way for them to come to me, so they may call upon the Father in my name.
Yes, and then the work will begin, with the Father among all nations, preparing the way for His people to gather home to their promised land.
And they will go out from all nations; they will not leave quickly or in a hurry, for I will go before them, says the Father, and I will be their protector from behind.
