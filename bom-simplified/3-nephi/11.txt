Jesus Christ revealed Himself to the Nephite people while they were gathered at the temple in the land of Bountiful, and He taught them; this is how He made Himself known to them.
A large crowd of Nephites had assembled around the temple in Bountiful, and they were amazed and talking about the incredible changes that had occurred.
They were also discussing Jesus Christ, about whom a sign had been given regarding His death.
While they were conversing, they heard a voice that seemed to come from heaven; they looked around because they did not understand the voice they heard. It wasn’t harsh or loud, but even though it was small, it penetrated deeply into those who heard it to the core of their being, making them tremble and causing their hearts to feel an intense burning.
They heard the voice again, but still did not understand it.
The third time they heard the voice, they opened their ears to listen; they fixed their gaze upward towards heaven where the sound was coming from.
On the third occasion, they finally understood the voice, which told them:
Look at my Beloved Son, in whom I am very pleased, in whom I have honored my name—listen to Him.
As they understood, they looked back up towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man coming down from heaven, dressed in a white robe, who came and stood among them. The whole crowd looked at Him, unable to speak to one another, puzzled and thinking that it was an angel who had appeared to them.
The Man raised His hand and spoke to the people, saying:
I am Jesus Christ, the one whom the prophets foretold would come into the world.
I am the light and life of the world; I have endured the bitter suffering that the Father gave me, and I have honored the Father by taking on the sins of the world, suffering according to His will from the very beginning.
When Jesus finished speaking these words, the entire crowd fell to the ground, for they remembered that it had been prophesied that Christ would reveal Himself to them after ascending into heaven.
Then the Lord spoke to them, saying:
Get up and come to me, so you can place your hands on my side and feel the marks of the nails in my hands and feet. This will help you know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole world, who was sacrificed for the sins of everyone.
The crowd approached and reached out to touch His side, and they felt the nail prints in His hands and feet. They each took turns doing this until everyone had come forward, seen with their own eyes, felt with their hands, and known for sure that it was He whom the prophets said would come.
Once everyone had witnessed it themselves, they all cried out together, saying:
Hosanna! Blessed is the name of the Most High God! They fell down at Jesus' feet and worshiped Him.
Then Jesus spoke to Nephi (who was among the crowd) and commanded him to come forward.
Nephi got up, approached, bowed down before the Lord, and kissed His feet.
The Lord instructed him to stand up. Nephi did so and stood before Him.
The Lord said to him: I give you the authority to baptize this people when I ascend back into heaven.
The Lord called others as well and gave them the same authority to baptize, instructing them on how to do it; He told them that there should be no arguments among them.
Truly, I say to you, anyone who repents of their sins through your teachings and wishes to be baptized in my name, here’s how you should baptize them—go down into the water and baptize them in my name.
And here are the words you should say, calling them by name:
I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Then you shall immerse them in the water and bring them back up out of the water.
This is how you should baptize in my name; for truly, I say to you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; I am in the Father, the Father is in me, and we are one.
As I have commanded you, this is how you should baptize. There should be no arguments among you, as there have been so far; nor should there be disputes regarding my doctrine.
For truly, I say to you, anyone who has a spirit of contention does not belong to me, but rather to the devil, who is the father of contention and stirs up anger in people so they fight against each other.
Pay attention, this is not my teaching; I do not want to stir up anger between people, but rather that these things should be put aside.
Truly, truly, I tell you, I will share my teachings with you.
This is my doctrine, given to me by the Father; I testify of the Father, and the Father testifies of me, and the Holy Ghost testifies of both the Father and me. I bear witness that the Father requires all people everywhere to repent and believe in me.
Anyone who believes in me and is baptized will be saved; they will inherit the kingdom of God.
Anyone who does not believe in me and is not baptized will face condemnation.
I truly affirm that this is my teaching, and I testify of it from the Father; and whoever believes in me also believes in the Father, and the Father will also testify of me to them for He will come to them in the presence of fire and the Holy Ghost.
This is how the Father will testify of me, and the Holy Ghost will also testify to them about the Father and me; for the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one.
And again I tell you, you must repent, become like little children, and be baptized in my name, or you cannot receive these things.
And again I say to you, you must repent, be baptized in my name, and be like little children, or you cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
Truly, truly, I say to you, this is my doctrine, and anyone who builds on it is building on my foundation, and the gates of hell will not overpower them.
Anyone who teaches more or less than this and establishes it as my doctrine is coming from evil and is not built on my foundation; they are building on a weak foundation, and the gates of hell will be open to receive them when storms come and winds blow upon them.
Therefore, go out to this people and proclaim the words I have spoken to the ends of the earth.
