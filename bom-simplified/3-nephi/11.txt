Jesus Christ showed himself to the people of Nephi while they were gathered in the land Bountiful and ministered to them in this way.
A large crowd of Nephite people gathered around the temple in Bountiful; they were amazed and talking among themselves, sharing news of the great and miraculous changes that had happened.
They were discussing Jesus Christ, about whom a sign had been given regarding his death.
As they were talking, they heard a voice that seemed to come from heaven; they looked around because they didn’t understand the voice; it wasn’t harsh or loud, but it was a soft voice that deeply impacted those who heard it, causing them to tremble, filling them with a burning feeling in their hearts.
Afterward, they heard the voice again, but they still didn’t understand it.
Then, for the third time, they heard the voice. They opened their ears to listen and looked up toward the sound, focusing intently on heaven, where the sound was coming from.
Then, for the third time, they understood the voice, which said to them:
Look at my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased and in whom I have honored my name—listen to him.
Once they understood, they looked up to heaven again and saw a man coming down from heaven, dressed in a white robe; he descended and stood among them, and everyone in the multitude gazed at him in silence, unsure what it meant, thinking perhaps an angel had appeared to them.
He then reached out his hand and spoke to the people, saying:
Look, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets said would come into the world.
Look, I am the light and the life of the world; I have endured the bitterness that the Father gave me, and I have honored the Father by taking upon myself the sins of the world, suffering in accordance with the Father’s will from the very beginning.
After Jesus spoke these words, the whole multitude fell to the ground; they remembered that it had been prophesied that Christ would appear to them after he ascended into heaven.
Then the Lord spoke to them, saying:
Get up and come to me, so that you may put your hands into my side and touch the wounds from the nails in my hands and feet, to know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, who was sacrificed for the sins of the world.
The multitude then approached and touched his side and felt the nail marks in his hands and feet; they went one by one until everyone had come, seen, and touched for themselves, knowing for certain that he was the one the prophets had foretold.
After they had all witnessed this, they cried out together:
Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! Then they fell down at Jesus’ feet and worshipped him.
Then Jesus spoke to Nephi (who was among the crowd) and told him to come forward.
Nephi stood up and approached, bowed before the Lord, and kissed his feet.
The Lord told him to get up. Nephi stood before him.
The Lord said to him: I give you the authority to baptize this people when I ascend back to heaven.
Then the Lord called others and told them the same; he gave them the power to baptize and instructed them on how to do it, saying there should be no arguments among them.
Truly I say to you, whoever repents of their sins through your words and desires to be baptized in my name, should be baptized this way—go down and stand in the water, and in my name, baptize them.
Here are the words you should say when baptizing, using their name:
With authority given me by Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Then you should immerse them in the water and bring them back up.
This is how you should baptize in my name; for truly I tell you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; I am in the Father, and the Father is in me, and we are one.
As I have commanded you, so shall you baptize. There shall be no arguments among you as there have been before, nor arguments about my teachings.
For truly, truly I say to you, anyone who has a spirit of conflict is not with me, but is of the devil, who is the father of conflict and stirs up anger among men to fight against each other.
Look, this is not my teaching, to stir anger in people's hearts against one another; my teaching is that such things should be put aside.
Look, truly, truly I say to you, I will share with you my teachings.
This is my doctrine, given to me by the Father; I bear witness of the Father, the Father bears witness of me, and the Holy Ghost bears witness of both the Father and me; I testify that the Father commands all people everywhere to repent and believe in me.
Anyone who believes in me and is baptized will be saved, and they will inherit the kingdom of God.
Anyone who does not believe in me and is not baptized will be condemned.
Truly, truly I say to you, this is my doctrine, and I testify of it from the Father; whoever believes in me believes in the Father as well; the Father will testify of me to him, visiting him with fire and the Holy Ghost.
Thus will the Father testify of me, and the Holy Ghost will testify to him of the Father and me; for the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one.
Again I say to you, you must repent, become like little children, and be baptized in my name, or you cannot receive these things.
Again I say to you, you must repent, be baptized in my name, and become like little children, or you cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
Truly, truly I say to you, this is my doctrine; whoever builds upon this builds on my rock, and the gates of hell will not overpower them.
Whoever declares more or less than this and establishes it as my teaching comes from evil; they do not build on my rock but build on sand, and the gates of hell will be wide open to receive them when trials come.
Therefore, go to this people and declare the words I have spoken to the ends of the earth.
