Third Nephi
The Book of Nephi, the Son of Helaman
Helaman was the son of another Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who was also a son of Alma. They were descendants of Nephi, the son of Lehi, who left Jerusalem in the first year of Zedekiah's reign as king of Judah.
Nephi, the son of Helaman, left the land, and his son Nephi took care of the records. Even though there were many miracles and signs, the wicked plotted to kill the righteous. The night of Christ's birth approached. The sign was given, and a new star appeared. Lies and deceit grew, and the Gadianton robbers killed many people. This was around A.D. 1–4.
The ninety-first year had ended, and it was six hundred years since Lehi left Jerusalem. Lachoneus was the chief judge and governor of the land that year.
Nephi, the son of Helaman, had left Zarahemla, entrusting the brass plates and all sacred records to his oldest son Nephi.
He left the land, and no one knew where he went. His son Nephi maintained the records of the people in his place.
At the start of the ninety-second year, the prophecies of the prophets began to come true more clearly, with even greater signs and miracles happening among the people.
However, some started to claim that the time had passed for Samuel’s prophecies to be fulfilled.
They rejoiced in front of their brethren, saying, “Look, the time has passed, and Samuel's words have not come true; therefore, your happiness and faith regarding this are in vain.”
They created a loud uproar throughout the land, causing believers to become very sad, fearing that the prophecies might not come to pass.
But they remained watchful for the day and night when it would be as one continuous day without night, hoping to prove that their faith was not in vain.
The unbelievers designated a day for all who believed in those traditions to be killed if the sign that Samuel prophesied did not happen.
When Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw the wickedness among his people, he felt deep sorrow.
He went out, knelt on the ground, and earnestly prayed to God on behalf of his people, especially those about to be destroyed because of their faith in their ancestors' traditions.
He cried out to the Lord all day long, and the voice of the Lord answered him, saying:
"Lift up your head and be cheerful; for the time is near, and this night the sign will be given, and tomorrow I will come into the world to fulfill everything I have spoken through my holy prophets."
"Look, I come to my own people to fulfill all things I have revealed to humanity since the world's foundation, and to do the will of both the Father and the Son—the Father through me, and the Son through my earthly form. The time is near, and the sign will be given tonight."
The words spoken to Nephi were fulfilled just as they had been said; at sunset, there was no darkness, and the people were astonished that when night came, it remained light.
Many who had doubted the prophets fell to the ground as if they were dead, realizing that the destructive plan they had for those who believed the prophets was foiled, for the sign had already come.
They began to understand that the Son of God would soon appear; indeed, everyone on earth, from west to east, both in the north and south, were so astonished that they fell to the ground.
They knew that prophets had testified of these events for many years, and the sign was now here; they began to fear because of their sins and disbelief.
There was no darkness throughout that night; it was as bright as midday. The sun rose the next morning as usual, and they recognized that it was the day the Lord was to be born, based on the sign given.
Everything happened exactly as the prophets had spoken.
A new star also appeared, just as prophesied.
From that moment on, lies began to spread among the people by Satan to harden their hearts so they would not believe the signs and wonders they had witnessed. Despite these lies, most of the people believed and turned to the Lord.
Nephi went among the people, along with many others, baptizing them in repentance, leading to a significant forgiveness of sins. So, the people started to find peace in the land again.
There were few disagreements, except for those who began to preach that it was no longer necessary to follow the law of Moses. In this matter, they were mistaken, as they did not understand the scriptures.
However, they soon became converted and recognized their errors when it was revealed to them that the law was not yet fulfilled and must be completed in every detail; they learned that not a single jot or tittle would pass away until everything was accomplished. Thus, in that same year, they were made aware of their mistakes and confessed their sins.
The ninety-second year passed, bringing good news to the people because of the fulfilled signs, as prophesied by all the holy prophets.
The ninety-third year also passed peacefully, except for the Gadianton robbers who lived in the mountains and plagued the land. Their strongholds and secret hideouts made it impossible for the people to defeat them, causing many murders and much bloodshed among their ranks.
By the ninety-fourth year, the robbers began to grow in strength, as many disaffected Nephites sought refuge with them, causing great sorrow among the Nephites who remained.
The Lamanites also experienced sorrow, as they had many children growing up who became strong and were led astray by some Zoramites with their lies and flattering words, joining the ranks of the Gadianton robbers.
Thus, the Lamanites faced their own challenges and began to lose their faith and righteousness due to the wickedness of the young generation.
