At the end of the eighteenth year, the robber armies were ready for battle and began to come down from the hills, mountains, wilderness, strongholds, and secret places. They started to take over the lands that the Nephites had abandoned, including the cities that were left in ruins.
However, there were no wild animals or game in the deserted lands, and the robbers could only find food in the wilderness.
The robbers struggled to survive without food because the Nephites had left their lands empty and taken their livestock and possessions with them, gathering into one group.
As a result, the robbers had no opportunity to steal food unless they attacked the Nephites directly. The Nephites were united, had a large number of people, and had stored enough supplies, horses, cattle, and flocks to survive for seven years. During this time, they hoped to eliminate the robbers from their land, and thus, the eighteenth year came to an end.
In the nineteenth year, Giddianhi realized he needed to attack the Nephites because the robbers could not survive without stealing, killing, and plundering.
The robbers did not dare to spread out across the land to farm because they feared the Nephites would come after them, so Giddianhi ordered his troops to prepare for battle against the Nephites.
They advanced to fight in the sixth month, and it was a fearsome and terrible day of battle. They were dressed like robbers, wearing lambskin around their waists dyed in blood, with their heads shorn and wearing headplates. The sight of Giddianhi's armies was frightening due to their terrifying appearance.
When the Nephite armies saw how Giddianhi’s troops looked, they fell to the ground and cried out to their God, asking Him to spare them and save them from their enemies.
Seeing this, Giddianhi's armies shouted loudly in joy, thinking the Nephites were afraid of them.
But they were mistaken; the Nephites did not fear the robbers; they feared God and prayed for His protection. So, when Giddianhi's armies attacked, the Nephites were ready to fight back; they relied on the strength of the Lord to confront them.
The battle began in the sixth month, and it was fierce and deadly, with great losses on both sides, unlike any slaughter among the people of Lehi since they left Jerusalem.
Despite Giddianhi's threats and promises, the Nephites defeated them, pushing them back.
Gidgiddoni ordered his troops to chase the robbers all the way to the wilderness' edge, showing no mercy to anyone who fell into their hands along the way, and they pursued and killed many until they obeyed Gidgiddoni’s command.
Giddianhi, who had fought bravely, was chased as he fled. Exhausted from the fighting, he was caught and killed, marking the end of Giddianhi the robber.
The Nephite armies returned to safety, and the nineteenth year ended without further attacks from the robbers; they did not try again in the twentieth year.
In the twenty-first year, the robbers didn't come for battle but surrounded the Nephite people to lay siege, believing that cutting them off from their lands and outside support would force them to surrender.
They had chosen a new leader named Zemnarihah, who was responsible for the siege.
However, this worked in favor of the Nephites, who had stockpiled supplies that made it impossible for the robbers to lay siege effectively.
The robbers had very little food, relying only on meat from the wilderness for survival.
As the wild game became scarce, the robbers were on the brink of starving.
The Nephites kept moving out day and night, attacking the robbers and cutting down thousands at a time.
Faced with such devastation, Zemnarihah’s people wanted to abandon their plan due to the continuous destruction they suffered.
Zemnarihah then ordered his troops to stop the siege and retreat to the far northern parts of the land.
Now, knowing their plan and their weakness from lack of food and heavy losses, Gidgiddoni sent his armies out at night to block their escape and positioned them along their retreat path.
They managed to move ahead of the robbers in the night, so when the robbers began to march, they were confronted by Nephite armies both in front and behind.
The robbers in the south also found their escape routes cut off. All of this was done under Gidgiddoni's orders.
Many thousands of robbers surrendered to the Nephites, while the rest were killed.
Their leader, Zemnarihah, was captured and hung from a tree until he died. After he was hanged, they cut down the tree and shouted loudly:
"May the Lord protect His people in righteousness and pure hearts, helping them to overcome all who seek to destroy them through power and secret plots, just as this man has fallen."
They rejoiced and cried out together, "May the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob protect this people in righteousness, as long as they call on His name for safety."
Then they all burst into song and praised their God for the incredible deliverance from their enemies.
They cried praises to the Most High God and blessed the name of the Lord Almighty.
Their hearts swelled with joy and tears flowed from their eyes because of God's great goodness in saving them from their enemies; they recognized that their deliverance came because they had repented and humbled themselves.
