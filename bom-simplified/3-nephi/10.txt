Everyone in the land heard these words and confirmed what they observed. After that, the land was silent for many hours.
The people were so amazed that they stopped grieving and wailing for their lost loved ones; thus, there was silence across the land for many hours.
Then a voice came again to the people, and they all heard it and testified about it, saying:
"O people of these great cities that have fallen, descendants of Jacob and part of the house of Israel, how often have I gathered you like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings and cared for you.
And again, how often would I have gathered you like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, O people of Israel who have fallen; O inhabitants of Jerusalem who have fallen; how often I would have gathered you like a hen gathers her chicks, but you didn't want it.
O house of Israel whom I have preserved, how often will I gather you like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings if you will repent and come back to me with a sincere heart?
But if not, O house of Israel, your homes will become deserted until the promises made to your ancestors are fulfilled.
After the people heard these words, they began to cry and mourn again for their lost family and friends.
Thus, three days passed. It was morning when the darkness lifted from the land, the earth stopped shaking, the rocks stopped breaking apart, the awful groans ceased, and all the loud noises disappeared.
The earth came back together as it was, and the mourning, weeping, and wailing of those who survived stopped; their sadness turned to joy, and their cries became praise and thanks to the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
So far, the scriptures spoken by the prophets were fulfilled.
It was the more righteous part of the people who were saved; they received the prophets and did not harm them. They had not shed the blood of the saints and were spared—
They were protected; they didn’t fall into the earth, drown in the sea, be burned by fire, crushed to death, swept away in a whirlwind, or overcome by smoke and darkness.
Now, anyone reading this should understand; if you have the scriptures, search them and see if all these deaths and destructions by fire, smoke, storms, whirlwinds, and the earth opening up to take them in are not fulfilling the prophecies of many holy prophets.
Look, I say unto you, many have witnessed these things at the coming of Christ and were killed because they testified about them.
Yes, the prophet Zenos testified about these things, as did Zenock, because their testimonies were specifically about us, who are the remnant of their descendants.
Behold, our father Jacob also testified of a remnant from the seed of Joseph. Aren’t we a remnant of Joseph's seed? And aren’t these testimonies about us written on the brass plates that our father Lehi brought from Jerusalem?
And it came to pass that at the end of the thirty-fourth year, I will show you that the spared people of Nephi and those called Lamanites, also spared, received great favors and abundant blessings, so much so that soon after Christ ascended into heaven, he truly showed himself to them—
Showing his body to them and serving them; a detailed account of his ministry will be provided later. Therefore, for now, I will conclude my words.
