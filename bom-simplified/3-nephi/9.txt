A voice was heard across all the land, calling to everyone living here:
Woe, woe, woe to this people; woe to everyone on the earth unless they repent; because the devil laughs, and his angels rejoice over the death of my good people; and it is their sins and wickedness that have led to their downfall!
Look, I have burned that great city Zarahemla with fire, along with its people.
And look, I have caused that great city Moroni to sink into the depths of the sea, drowning its people.
And see, I have covered that great city Moronihah with soil, and its people, so that their sins and wrongdoings are hidden from my sight, so that the blood of the prophets and saints won’t come before me anymore against them.
And behold, I caused the city of Gilgal to sink, along with its people buried deep in the earth;
Yes, and the city of Onihah and its people, and the city of Mocum and its people, and the city of Jerusalem and its people; and I made waters to rise in their place, to hide their wickedness from my sight, so the blood of the prophets and saints won’t come before me anymore against them.
And see, the cities of Gadiandi, Gadiomnah, Jacob, and Gimgimno, I have caused to sink, creating hills and valleys where they were, and their people have been buried in the depths of the earth to hide their wickedness and wrongdoings from my sight, so that the blood of the prophets and saints would not call out to me against them anymore.
And see, that great city Jacobugath, where King Jacob's people lived, I caused to be burned with fire for their sins, which were worse than all the wickedness in the world, because of their secret murders and conspiracies; for they destroyed the peace of my people and the governance of the land, so I made them burn, that the blood of the prophets and saints would not call out to me against them anymore.
And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, I caused to be burned with fire, along with the people there, due to their wickedness in throwing out the prophets and stoning those I sent to warn them about their sins and wrongdoings.
Because they cast out all the righteous, I sent down fire to destroy them, so that their wickedness and wrongdoings could be hidden from my sight, so that the blood of the prophets and saints I had sent among them wouldn’t call out to me from the ground against them.
And I have caused many great destructions to come upon this land and these people because of their sins and iniquities.
O all of you who have been spared because you were more righteous than them, will you not return to me, repent of your sins, and change your hearts, so that I may heal you?
Yes, I truly say to you, if you come to me, you will have eternal life. Look, my arm of mercy is extended toward you, and whoever will come, I will welcome; and blessed are those who come to me.
Look, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth and everything in them. I was with the Father from the very beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father is in me; and through me, the Father has glorified His name.
I came to my own people, but they did not accept me. The prophecies about my coming have been fulfilled.
And to all who have accepted me, I have given the power to become the children of God; and I will also do this for those who will believe in my name, for through me comes redemption, and in me, the law of Moses is fulfilled.
I am the light and the life of the world. I am the beginning and the end.
You will no longer need to offer me blood sacrifices; indeed, your sacrifices and burnt offerings will no longer be accepted, for I will not accept any of them.
Instead, you should offer me a broken heart and a humble spirit. Whoever comes to me with a broken heart and a humble spirit, I will baptize with fire and with the Holy Spirit, just as the Lamanites were baptized with fire and the Holy Spirit because of their faith in me at the time of their conversion, even though they did not realize it.
Look, I have come into the world to bring redemption to everyone and to save the world from sin.
Therefore, anyone who repents and comes to me as a little child, I will receive, for such is the kingdom of God. Look, for them, I laid down my life and took it back again; therefore, repent, and come to me, all you ends of the earth, and be saved.
