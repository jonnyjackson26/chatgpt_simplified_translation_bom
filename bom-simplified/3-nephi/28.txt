When Jesus finished speaking, he addressed each of his disciples individually, asking them what they wanted from him after he returned to the Father.
All the disciples spoke except for three, saying: We hope that after living a full life, our service, for which you have called us, may come to an end quickly so we can be with you in your kingdom.
He told them: You are blessed because you asked this of me; thus, after you reach the age of seventy-two, you will join me in my kingdom, where you will find rest.
After talking to the other disciples, he turned to the three and asked: What do you want from me when I go to the Father?
They felt sorrowful inside and didn't dare to ask him for what they desired.
He said to them: I know your thoughts, and you are wishing for the same thing that John, my beloved disciple who was with me before I was taken by the Jews, asked of me.
Therefore, you are even more blessed because you will never experience death; you will live to see all the works of the Father among mankind until everything is fulfilled as he wishes, when I return in my glory with heavenly powers.
You will not feel the pain of death; when I come in my glory, you will be transformed in an instant from mortality to immortality; then you will be blessed in my Father's kingdom.
Additionally, you will not suffer while you are in the flesh, except for the sins of the world; all this I will do because you wished to bring the souls of men to me while the world exists.
Because of this, you will experience complete joy; you will sit in my Father's kingdom, and your joy will be full, just as the Father has given me complete joy; you will be like I am, just as I am like the Father; we are one.
The Holy Spirit testifies of the Father and me; the Father gives the Holy Spirit to people because of me.
When Jesus finished speaking, he touched each disciple with his finger except for the three who were meant to stay on earth, and then he left.
Then the heavens were opened, and they were taken up into heaven, where they saw and heard things beyond words.
They were forbidden to share what they experienced or had the power to express what they saw and heard;
They couldn't tell if they were in their bodies or not; it seemed like they changed from their physical bodies to an immortal state so they could see the things of God.
But they returned to minister on earth; however, they did not share what they had witnessed or heard because of the command they received in heaven.
I can't say whether they were mortal or immortal after their transformation, 
But according to the record given, they ministered across the land, bringing many people to believe in their teachings, baptizing them, and those who were baptized received the Holy Ghost.
They were imprisoned by those outside the church, but the prisons could not contain them; they were torn apart.
They were thrown into the ground, but they struck the earth with God's word, and by his power, they were freed from the depths of the earth; hence, they could not be trapped.
They were thrown into a furnace three times and emerged unharmed.
They were thrown into a den of wild animals two times; they played with the beasts like a child with a lamb and suffered no harm.
So they preached the gospel of Christ to all the people of Nephi; many were converted to the Lord and united with the church of Christ, blessing the generation as Jesus promised.
And now I, Mormon, pause my account of these matters for a time.
I was going to write the names of those who would never die, but the Lord forbade me; therefore, I will not disclose them, for they are hidden from the world.
However, I have seen them, and they have served me.
They will appear among the Gentiles, but the Gentiles will not recognize them.
They will also be present among the Jews, but the Jews will likewise not know them.
When the Lord decides in his wisdom, they will serve all the scattered tribes of Israel and all nations, helping many souls come to Jesus, fulfilling their desire and demonstrating God's convincing power within them.
They are like God's angels, and if they pray to the Father in Jesus' name, they can reveal themselves to whomever they choose.
So, significant and extraordinary works will be done by them before the day comes when all people must stand before Christ's judgment seat;
Even among the Gentiles, great and marvelous works will be performed by them before that judgment day.
If you had all the scriptures documenting the marvelous works of Christ, you would understand, according to his words, that these things are certain to happen.
Woe will come to anyone who does not listen to the words of Jesus and those he has chosen to send among them; for whoever rejects the words of Jesus and his sent servants will not receive him; thus, they will not receive them on the last day;
It would be better for them never to have been born. Do you think you can escape the justice of a God who has been trampled by men just so that salvation could come?
Now, concerning those whom the Lord has chosen, particularly the three who were taken up into heaven, I was unsure if they were cleansed from mortality to immortalityâ€”
But since writing this, I have sought the Lord, and he has shown me that a change must occur in their bodies, or else they must experience death;
Thus, to prevent them from tasting death, a change was made in their bodies so that they would not suffer pain or sorrow, except for the sins of the world.
Now, this transformation was not the same as what will occur on the last day; but they were changed so that Satan could not overpower them or tempt them; they were made holy in the flesh, and the earthly powers could not hold them.
In this state, they were to remain until the judgment day of Christ; on that day, they will undergo a greater transformation and will be received into the Father's kingdom, where they will dwell with God forever in heaven.
