Many among the Nephites had complete faith in the words of the holy prophets; they were certain that these prophecies would come true.
They understood that it was necessary for Christ to come because of the many signs given by the prophets, and because the earlier events affirmed that everything would happen as foretold.
Because of this understanding, they gave up all their sins, immoral behaviors, and wrongful acts; they served God diligently, both day and night.
When they captured all the robbers, ensuring none escaped unless they were killed, they put their prisoners in jail and preached God's word to them; those who were willing to repent and promise not to kill again were released.
However, those who refused to make this promise and who still harbored thoughts of secret murders, as well as those who threatened their fellow citizens, were punished under the law.
This ended the wicked and secretive groups that had caused so much evil and committed many murders.
Thus, the years went by: the twenty-second, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth years passed, totaling twenty-five years.
Many significant events occurred during that time, some of which people might find remarkable, but this book cannot include all of them; it canâ€™t even contain one-hundredth of everything that took place among so many people during those twenty-five years.
However, there are other records that detail all the activities of these people, and Nephi provided a shorter, accurate account.
So, I have compiled my own record based on Nephi's writings, which were engraved on the plates known as the plates of Nephi.
And I am writing on plates I created with my own hands.
I am Mormon, named after the land of Mormon, where Alma first established the church among the people after their wrongdoing.
I follow Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and I have been chosen by Him to share His word with my people so they can have eternal life.
It has become important, according to God's will, for me to write down what has happened to fulfill the prayers of the holy ones who have passed away, based on their faith.
This will be a brief record of events from the time Lehi left Jerusalem to the present day.
I create my record from the accounts provided by those before me, leading up to my time.
Then, I will include my account of the things I have personally witnessed.
I know that what I am recording is accurate and truthful; however, there are many things that our language cannot adequately express.
Now, I will conclude my personal remarks and move on to recount the events that have occurred before me.
I am Mormon, a direct descendant of Lehi. I have great reason to thank my God and Savior, Jesus Christ, for bringing our ancestors out of Jerusalem, known only to Him and those who left with Him, and for giving me and my people so much knowledge for our salvation.
He has certainly blessed the house of Jacob and shown mercy to the descendants of Joseph.
As long as Lehi's children have followed His commandments, He has blessed and prospered them as promised.
Indeed, He will again lead a remnant of Joseph's descendants to the knowledge of the Lord their God.
Just as surely as the Lord lives, He will gather all of Jacob's scattered descendants from across the earth.
And as He has made promises to all of Jacob's descendants, He will fulfill those promises in His perfect timing, restoring all of Jacob's house to the knowledge of their covenant with Him.
Then they will know their Redeemer, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and they will be gathered from all corners of the earth back to their own lands whence they have been scattered; as the Lord lives, it will happen. Amen.
