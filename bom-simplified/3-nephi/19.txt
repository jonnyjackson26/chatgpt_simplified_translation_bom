After Jesus returned to heaven, the crowd scattered, and each person took their family back home.
News quickly spread among the people, even before nightfall, that the crowd had seen Jesus and that he had cared for them, and that he would reveal himself to them again the next day.
Throughout the night, the news about Jesus circulated widely, causing many people to work hard to ensure they would be present in the place where Jesus would return the following day.
The next day, when the crowd gathered, Nephi and his brother Timothy, whom he had raised from the dead, along with Nephi’s son Jonas, and Mathoni, Mathonihah, Kumen, Kumenonhi, Jeremiah, Shemnon, Jonas, Zedekiah, and Isaiah—all of whom were the disciples chosen by Jesus—came forward and stood among the crowd.
The crowd was so large that they needed to break into twelve groups.
The twelve disciples taught the crowd, and they urged everyone to kneel down on the ground and pray to the Father in the name of Jesus.
The disciples also prayed to the Father in Jesus' name. Afterward, they stood up and served the people.
When they prayed the exact words Jesus had spoken—without changing anything—they knelt again to pray to the Father in Jesus' name.
They prayed for what they deeply desired, asking for the Holy Ghost to be given to them.
After they prayed, they went to the water's edge, and the crowd followed them.
Nephi stepped into the water and was baptized.
He came out of the water and began baptizing others, including everyone whom Jesus had chosen.
When they had all been baptized and emerged from the water, the Holy Ghost descended upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
It seemed as if they were surrounded by fire that came down from heaven, and the crowd witnessed this and testified to it; angels came down from heaven and ministered to them.
While the angels were serving the disciples, Jesus appeared and stood among them to minister to them.
He spoke to the crowd, commanding them to kneel again on the ground, and he instructed his disciples to kneel as well.
When everyone had knelt down, Jesus instructed his disciples to pray.
They began to pray, addressing Jesus as their Lord and God.
After that, Jesus stepped away from them for a short distance, knelt down, and said:
Father, I thank you for giving the Holy Ghost to those whom I have chosen; it is their belief in me that has led me to choose them from the world.
Father, I ask you to give the Holy Ghost to everyone who believes in what they preach.
Father, you have given them the Holy Ghost because they have faith in me; you see their faith because they pray to me, and they pray to me because I am with them.
Now Father, I pray for them and for all those who will believe in their words, so that they may believe in me, and I may be in them just as you, Father, are in me, so that we may be one.
After Jesus prayed to the Father, he approached his disciples, who continued to pray to him without stopping, using only a few words as they were inspired about what to pray for, filled with a strong desire.
Jesus blessed them as they prayed, smiling upon them, and the light of his face shone on them, making them as white as Jesus himself; indeed, their whiteness was far beyond anything else on earth.
Jesus told them: Keep praying; however, they did not stop praying.
He turned away again, moved a little ways off, and prayed again to the Father, saying:
Father, I thank you for purifying those I have chosen because of their faith, and I pray for them and for those who will believe in their words so that they may also be purified in me through faith, just as they have been purified in me.
Father, I do not pray for the world, but for those you have given me from the world because of their faith, so that they may be purified in me, so that I may be in them as you, Father, are in me, so that we may be one and I may be glorified in them.
When Jesus finished speaking, he returned to his disciples, who were still praying steadfastly to him, and he smiled on them again, and they were white, just like Jesus.
He moved away a little distance and prayed to the Father;
And the words he prayed were beyond what any tongue could express or human could write.
The crowd heard him and testified to it; their hearts were open, and they understood the words he prayed.
However, the words he prayed were so wonderful and extraordinary that no one could write them down or express them.
When Jesus finished praying, he came back to his disciples and told them: I have never seen such great faith among all the Jews; therefore, I could not perform such great miracles among them because of their lack of faith.
Truly, I tell you, none of them have seen such wonderful things as you have seen, nor have they heard such impressive things as you have heard.
