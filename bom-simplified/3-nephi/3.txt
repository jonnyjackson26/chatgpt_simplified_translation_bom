In the sixteenth year after Christ came, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, got a letter from the leader of a group of robbers. This is what the letter said:
Lachoneus, the respected governor of the land, I'm writing to you to give you a lot of praise for your determination and that of your people in standing up for what you believe is your right and freedom. You seem to hold your ground as if you were backed by the strength of a god, defending your liberty, property, and country, or what you consider to be so.
It seems foolish to me, Lachoneus, that you think you can withstand so many brave men at my command, who are currently armed and anxiously waiting for the order to attack the Nephites and destroy them.
I know their unbeatable spirit, having faced them in battle, and I understand their enduring hatred for you because of the many wrongs you have done. If they come against you, they would bring complete destruction.
That’s why I wrote this letter with my own hand, concerned for your well-being due to your unwavering belief in what is right and your brave spirit in battle.
So, I urge you to surrender to my people, giving up your cities, lands, and possessions, rather than face the sword and destruction.
In other words, give yourselves to us, join us, learn our secret ways, and become like us—not our slaves, but our brothers and partners in everything we have.
I swear to you, if you do this, you will not be destroyed; but if you refuse, I swear that next month I will send my armies against you, and they will not hold back or spare you, but will kill you until you are completely wiped out.
I am Giddianhi, the governor of this secret society of Gadianton, which I believe to be good and is of ancient origin, passed down to us.
I hope that you will hand over your lands and possessions peacefully, so that my people can reclaim their rights and government, which they have left because of your wickedness in denying them their rights. If you don't do this, I will take revenge for their grievances. I am Giddianhi.
When Lachoneus received this letter, he was greatly shocked by Giddianhi's boldness in demanding the Nephites' land and threatening them while avenging wrongs done to those who had only harmed themselves by joining those wicked robbers.
Lachoneus was a fair man and wouldn't be intimidated by a robber's demands, so he ignored Giddianhi's letter. Instead, he urged his people to pray to the Lord for help when the robbers attacked.
He sent a proclamation for everyone to gather their women, children, flocks, herds, and all their possessions, except for their land, in one location.
He had strong fortifications built around their gathering place, with great strength. He also organized both Nephite and Lamanite armies, or anyone counted among the Nephites, to guard them against the robbers day and night.
He said to them: As the Lord lives, unless you repent of your sins and cry out to the Lord, you will not be saved from the hands of those Gadianton robbers.
Lachoneus's powerful words and prophecies instilled fear in all the people, motivating them to follow his advice with great effort.
He appointed chief captains over all Nephite armies to lead them when the robbers would come down from the wilderness to attack.
The highest-ranking of these captains, the main commander of all Nephite armies, was named Gidgiddoni.
It was common among the Nephites to choose their chief captains (except in times of wickedness) to be individuals with the spirit of prophecy and revelation; therefore, Gidgiddoni was a great prophet, just like the chief judge.
The people said to Gidgiddoni: Pray to the Lord, and let’s go into the mountains and wilderness to surprise the robbers and defeat them in their own land.
But Gidgiddoni replied: The Lord forbids it; if we go against them, the Lord would hand us over to them. So we will prepare ourselves in the center of our land, gathering all our armies together, and we won’t attack them; instead, we’ll wait for them to come against us. As the Lord lives, if we do this, He will deliver them into our hands.
In the seventeenth year, towards the end of the year, Lachoneus's proclamation spread across the land, and the people gathered everything: their horses, chariots, cattle, flocks, herds, grain, and possessions. They marched in large groups to the place designated to come together to defend against their enemies.
The appointed area was the land of Zarahemla and the space between Zarahemla and Bountiful, up to the border between Bountiful and Desolation.
Many thousands of people called Nephites gathered in this land. Lachoneus had them come together in the south because of the great curse upon the northern land.
They fortified themselves to defend against their enemies, living as one community, and were so moved by Lachoneus's words that they repented of their sins and prayed to the Lord to save them when their enemies came to battle.
They were very sorrowful because of their enemies. Gidgiddoni ensured they made all kinds of weapons for war, and that they equipped themselves with armor, shields, and bucklers according to his guidance.
