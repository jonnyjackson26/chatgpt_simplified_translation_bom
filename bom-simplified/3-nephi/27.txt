Jesus commands that the Church be named after Him—His mission and sacrifice make up His gospel—People are instructed to repent and be baptized so they can be made holy by the Holy Spirit—They should strive to be like Jesus.
As the followers of Jesus traveled, preaching what they had learned and baptized in His name, they came together for powerful prayer and fasting.
Jesus appeared to them again while they were praying to the Father in His name; He stood among them and asked: What do you want me to give you?
They replied: Lord, we want you to tell us the name we should use for this church, since there are disputes among the people about it.
The Lord said: Truly, I tell you, why should the people argue about this?
Haven’t they read the scriptures that say you must adopt the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name you will be called on the final day;
And anyone who takes my name upon themselves and remains faithful until the end will be saved on the last day.
So, whatever you do, do it in my name; therefore, you will call the church by my name; and you will pray to the Father in my name so that He will bless the church for my sake.
How can it be my church if it is not called by my name? If the church is named after Moses, then it belongs to Moses; if it is named after a man, then it belongs to that man; but if it is called in my name, then it is my church, provided that it is built upon my gospel.
I assure you, you are built on my gospel; therefore, anything you refer to must be in my name; thus, if you pray to the Father for the church, and it is in my name, the Father will listen to you;
And if the church is built on my gospel, then the Father will show His works in it.
But if it isn’t built on my gospel, and instead is based on human efforts or the works of the devil, I tell you that they may find temporary joy in their works, but eventually they will face destruction and be thrown into the fire, from which there is no escape.
Their deeds will follow them; it’s their actions that lead to their downfall; so remember what I’ve told you.
Look, I have given you my gospel, and this is the gospel I have shared with you—that I came into the world to fulfill my Father’s will, as my Father sent me.
And my Father sent me so that I could be lifted on the cross; and after I was lifted up on the cross, I would draw all people to me, that as I have been raised by men, so shall men be raised by the Father, to stand before me and be judged for their deeds, whether they are good or evil—
And for this reason I was lifted up; so, by the power of the Father, I will draw everyone to me for judgment based on their actions.
It will come to pass that whoever repents and is baptized in my name will be filled with the Spirit; and if they remain faithful until the end, I will declare them innocent before my Father at that time when I stand to judge the world.
But anyone who does not stay faithful until the end will also be cut down and thrown into the fire, from which they cannot return, due to the Father’s justice.
These are the words He has given to mankind. He fulfills what He has promised; He does not lie, but fulfills all His words.
Nothing impure can enter His kingdom; therefore, only those who have been cleansed by my blood, through their faith, repentance of all sins, and faithfulness until the end, can enter His rest.
Now this is the command: Repent, all you people, and come to me and be baptized in my name, so that you may be purified by receiving the Holy Spirit, and stand clean before me on the last day.
Truly, I say to you, this is my gospel; and you know what you must do in my church; for the actions you have seen me perform, you should also carry out; what you have seen me do, you will do;
Thus, if you do these things, you will be blessed, and you will be exalted on the last day.
Write the things you have seen and heard, except for what is forbidden.
Document the works of this people, which will match what has been written about the past.
Look, from the records that have been and will be made, this people will be judged, for through these, their actions will be made known to others.
And know that everything is recorded by the Father; therefore, from the books that will be created, the world will be judged.
You will be judges of this people based on the fair judgment I will give you. So, what kind of people should you be? I tell you, be like me.
And now I return to the Father. I assure you, anything you ask the Father in my name will be given to you.
So, ask, and you will receive; knock, and it will be opened to you; for whoever asks receives, and whoever knocks, it will be opened.
Look, I feel immense joy because of you and this generation; yes, the Father rejoices, and all the holy angels rejoice because of you and this generation; for none of them are lost.
I want you to understand; I refer to those who are living in this generation; and none of them are lost; in them, I find complete joy.
But, I feel sorrow for the fourth generation from this one, for they will be led away like the son of destruction; they will betray me for silver and gold, for things that decay and can be stolen. And on that day, I will repay them for their actions.
After Jesus spoke these things, he told his disciples: Enter through the narrow gate; for narrow is the gate, and difficult is the way that leads to life, and few find it; while the gate is wide, and the path is easy that leads to destruction, and many follow that path until the night arrives when no one can work.
