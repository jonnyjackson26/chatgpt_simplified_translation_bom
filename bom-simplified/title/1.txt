The Book of Mormon
A record written by Mormon on plates taken from Nephi's records.
This is a summary of the records of the Nephites and the Lamanites—It is written for the Lamanites, who are part of Israel; and also for Jews and Gentiles—It is written as commanded, inspired by prophecy and revelation—It was recorded, sealed, and hidden away by the Lord so it wouldn't be lost—It will be brought forth by God's power to be understood—It is sealed by Moroni and kept hidden until the right time when it will come forth through the Gentiles—Its understanding comes by God's gift.
This also includes a summary from the Book of Ether, which tells the story of the people of Jared, who were scattered when the Lord confused their language while they were trying to build a tower to heaven—This shows the remnant of Israel the great deeds the Lord did for their ancestors; and that they should understand the Lord's promises, that they are not abandoned forever—It's also meant to help both Jews and Gentiles believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, who reveals himself to all nations—And if there are any mistakes, they are human errors; so don’t blame the things of God, so that you may be seen as blameless at the judgment of Christ.
Translated by Joseph Smith, Jun.
