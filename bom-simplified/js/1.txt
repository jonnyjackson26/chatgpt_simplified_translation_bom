The Prophet Joseph Smith’s own words about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon are:
“On the evening of the twenty-first of September [1823], I went to pray and ask God for help. 
“While I was praying, I saw a bright light filling my room, lighting it up more than the brightest part of the day, and then a figure appeared at my bedside, floating in the air, not touching the ground.
“He wore a loose robe that was incredibly white—whiter than anything I had ever seen on earth, and I don't think anything on earth could ever be that white. His hands and arms were bare above the wrists, his feet were also bare, with legs showing above the ankles, and his head and neck were exposed too. His robe was open, allowing me to see his chest.
“Not only was his robe very white, but he himself looked glorious, and his face was as bright as lightning. The light in the room was great, but not as bright as around his figure. At first, I was scared when I saw him, but that fear quickly went away.
“He said my name and told me he was a messenger from God’s presence, named Moroni, and that God had an important task for me; my name would be spoken of positively and negatively among all nations and peoples.
“He mentioned that there was a book made of gold plates that contained the history of the ancient people of this continent and where they came from. He also said it included the full Gospel as taught by Jesus to the ancient inhabitants.
“He continued to explain that there were two stones set in silver frames—these were attached to a breastplate and were what was called the Urim and Thummim—kept with the plates, and these stones were used by 'seers' in ancient times. God had prepared them to help translate the book.
“He warned me that when I acquired the plates, which wasn’t yet the right time, I shouldn’t show them to anyone, including the breastplate and the Urim and Thummim, except to those I was instructed to show them to; doing otherwise would lead to my destruction. As we spoke about the plates, I vividly saw in my mind where they were hidden, and I recognized the place when I visited it.
“After this conversation, I saw the light started to gather around the figure speaking to me, until the room went dark, except for the area around him; then, suddenly, I saw him ascend into heaven until he completely vanished, returning the room to its previous darkness.
“I lay there, contemplating the unusual scene and amazed at what the messenger had told me, when suddenly, my room began to light up again, and in an instant, the heavenly messenger was back by my bedside.
“He started by repeating everything he had said during his first visit without changing a word; after that, he warned me about terrible disasters coming to the earth, like famine, war, and disease, which would happen in this generation. After sharing this, he ascended back into heaven as before.
“By this time, the experiences had such a strong impact on me that I couldn’t sleep, lying there in shock over what I had seen and heard. To my surprise, the same messenger appeared once more by my bedside and went over the same information again; he added a warning that Satan would tempt me to seek the plates for riches, given my family's poor situation. He told me to have no other purpose in obtaining the plates except to honor God, and I must only seek to build His kingdom; otherwise, I would fail to obtain them.
“After this third visit, he ascended again, leaving me to ponder the peculiarity of my experience; soon after, as the rooster crowed, I realized morning was near, meaning we must have spoken the whole night.
“I rose from my bed and went about my daily tasks, but I felt so weak that I could hardly carry on. My father, working beside me, noticed something was wrong and told me to go home. I intended to head home but, as I tried to cross a fence from the field, my strength gave out, and I collapsed, losing consciousness for a time.
“The first thing I remember was a voice calling my name. I looked up and saw the same messenger above me, surrounded by light as before. He then repeated everything he had told me the night before and instructed me to share the vision and divine instructions with my father.
“I followed his command and returned to my father in the field, telling him everything. He responded that it was from God and urged me to do as the messenger instructed. I left the field and went straight to where the messenger had indicated the plates were hidden; and thanks to the clarity of the vision I’d seen, I recognized the place the moment I arrived.
“Near the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, there is a large hill, the tallest in the area. On the west side of this hill, close to the top, I found a large stone, under which the plates were buried in a stone box. The stone was rounded in the middle and thicker there than at the edges, so part of it was visible above the ground, while the edges were covered with dirt.
“I cleared away the dirt and managed to get a lever beneath the stone and lifted it with some effort. I looked inside and saw the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, just as the messenger had said. The box was made from stones held together with some cement. Inside, there were two stones laid across the bottom of the box, and on these stones were the plates and other items.
“I tried to take them out, but the messenger forbade me, explaining that the time to bring them forth had not come yet, and it wouldn't be for another four years. He instructed me to return to that spot exactly one year later, where he would meet me again, and I would keep coming back until it was time to obtain the plates.
“As instructed, I went back at the end of each year, and each time I found the same messenger, who provided me with guidance on what the Lord intended to do, as well as how His kingdom would function in the last days.
“Finally, the time came for me to obtain the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On September 22, 1827, I returned to the appointed location and received the plates from the same heavenly messenger, who then instructed me that I was responsible for them, warning that if I lost them or was careless, I would be cut off. However, if I did my best to protect them until he called for them, they would be safe.
“I quickly understood why the messenger had stressed the importance of keeping them safe and why he mentioned that when I fulfilled my part, he would call for them. As soon as it became known that I had them, many people tried everything possible to take them from me. Persecutions intensified, and countless individuals were constantly trying to seize them. But, through God’s wisdom, they remained with me until I achieved what was required of me. When the time came for me to return them as arranged, I gave them back to the messenger, who has kept them safe until now, May 2, 1838.”

The ancient record that was recovered from the earth speaks for a people long gone and has been translated into modern language through the divine power of God, first published to the world as The Book of Mormon.
