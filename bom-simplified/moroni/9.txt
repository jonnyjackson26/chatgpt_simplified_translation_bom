The second letter from Mormon to his son Moroni.
This chapter covers various sad events.
Both the Nephites and the Lamanites have become morally corrupt—They harm and kill each other—Mormon hopes that mercy and goodness will always be with Moroni. Around A.D. 401.
My dear son, I am writing to you again to let you know that I am still alive, though I must talk about some very painful things.
I have faced a terrible battle with the Lamanites, and we did not win; Archeantus has been killed, along with Luram and Emron; indeed, we have lost many of our best men.
Now I worry, my son, that the Lamanites will wipe out our people because they refuse to change, and evil keeps stoking their anger towards one another.
I am working hard to help them, but when I speak God's word strongly, they become furious with me; and when I speak gently, they harden their hearts against it; so I fear that the Lord’s Spirit is no longer trying to reach them.
They are so filled with anger that it seems they don’t fear death anymore; they have lost their love for each other, and they constantly crave blood and revenge.
Now, my dear son, despite their stubbornness, we must work hard; for if we stop working, we will face punishment; we have a task to do while we are in this mortal body, so we can defeat the enemy of all righteousness and find peace in God’s kingdom.
Now I want to mention a bit about how much this people is suffering. From what I learned from Amoron, the Lamanites have taken many prisoners from the tower of Sherrizah, including men, women, and children.
They have killed the husbands and fathers of those women and children; they feed the women the flesh of their husbands and the children the flesh of their fathers; they provide them with only a small amount of water.
Despite the horrific acts of the Lamanites, what our people in Moriantum have done is just as bad. Many Lamanite daughters have been taken as captives; after taking away what is most precious to them— their purity and virtue—
They too have been brutally murdered, tortured to death; and after that, their bodies are eaten like those of wild animals, hardened by their hearts; they do this to show their bravery.
Oh, my beloved son, how can a people like this, who are so uncivilized—
(And just a few years ago, they were a civilized and joyful people)
But oh my son, how can a people like this, who relish in such wickedness—
How can we think that God will not judge us?
Look, my heart cries out: Woe to this people. Come forth in your judgment, O God, and hide their sins and evil actions from your sight!
And again, my son, many widows and their daughters are left in Sherrizah; whatever supplies the Lamanites didn’t take, the army of Zenephi has taken, leaving them to wander wherever they can find food; many old women have collapsed and died along the way.
The army with me is weak; the Lamanite armies are positioned between Sherrizah and me; and many who fled to Aaron's army fell victim to their horrible cruelty.
Oh, the depravity of my people! They are chaotic and merciless. Look, I am just a man, and I have only human strength, and I can’t enforce my orders anymore.
They are growing strong in their corruption; they are equally ruthless, sparing neither old nor young; they find pleasure in everything except what is good; the suffering of our women and children across this land is beyond words; it cannot be fully expressed.
Now, my son, I won’t dwell on this terrible scene any longer. You know how wicked these people are; you know they have no principles and are past feeling; their evil exceeds that of the Lamanites.
Look, my son, I cannot recommend them to God, or I would be struck down.
But, my son, I recommend you to God, and I have faith in Christ that you will be saved; I pray to God that He will spare your life so you can see either the return of His people to Him or their complete destruction; I know they will perish unless they repent and come back to Him.
If they perish, it will be just like the Jaredites did, because of their stubborn hearts, seeking blood and revenge.
If they do perish, we know many of our brothers have gone over to the Lamanites, and many more will follow; so please write down some things, in case I don’t live to see you again; but I hope to see you soon, because I have sacred records I want to give you.
My son, stay faithful in Christ; and may the things I have written not distress you or weigh you down to despair; but may Christ lift you up, and may His suffering and death, and the appearance of His body to our ancestors, along with His mercy, patience, and the hope of His glory and eternal life, remain in your thoughts forever.
And may the grace of God the Father, who reigns high in the heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sits in power at His side until all things are subject to Him, be with you and stay with you always. Amen.
