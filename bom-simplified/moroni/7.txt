An invitation is extended to find peace in the Lord—Pray sincerely—The Spirit of Christ helps people distinguish between good and evil—Satan tries to lead people away from Christ and toward wrongdoing—Prophets testify about Christ's arrival—Through faith, miracles happen and angels serve—People should aspire for eternal life and embrace love.
Now, I, Moroni, will share some teachings of my father Mormon, who spoke about faith, hope, and love while instructing the people in the place of worship they had built.
At this moment, I, Mormon, speak to you, my dear brothers; I am able to address you now due to the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, which is part of His divine plan for me.
So, I want to talk to you who are members of the church, peaceful followers of Christ, who have hope strong enough to find rest in the Lord from now until you rest with Him in heaven.
I come to this conclusion about you based on how peacefully you interact with others.
I remember the words of God that say you can recognize people by what they do; if their actions are good, then they are good too.
Because, truly, God has said an evil person cannot do good things; if they give a gift or pray to God, it’s worthless unless it’s done sincerely.
For, truly, it won't count as righteousness for them.
If an evil person gives a gift, they do so with reluctance, so it’s as if they never gave it; thus, they are seen as evil in God’s eyes.
The same goes for praying without sincere intent; it brings no benefit because God does not accept such prayers.
So, an evil person cannot do good things; they won't offer good gifts, either.
One cannot bring forth good from a bad source; likewise, someone who serves the devil cannot follow Christ, and if they do follow Christ, they cannot be a servant of the devil.
All good things come from God, while evil comes from the devil, who is against God and constantly fights Him, tempting and encouraging people to sin and do bad things.
However, everything from God invites and encourages doing good constantly; therefore, anything that urges you to do good, love God, and serve Him is inspired by God.
So, be careful, my dear brothers, that you do not mistake evil for good or misjudge what is good as something from the devil.
For, my brothers, you have the ability to tell good from evil; and the way to judge it is clear, like daylight is from the darkest night.
Every person receives the Spirit of Christ to discern good from evil; that's how I show you how to judge—everything that invites you to do good and believe in Christ is sent by His power and gift, allowing you to know for sure it is from God.
But anything that encourages doing evil and denies Christ and does not serve God is definitely from the devil; that's how the devil works—he never leads anyone to do good, not even one person; neither do his angels, nor those who follow him.
Now, my brothers, since you recognize the light that allows you to judge, which is the light of Christ, make sure you don’t judge incorrectly; because with the same judgment you use, you will also be judged.
So, I ask you, brothers, to search diligently with the light of Christ to identify good from evil; and if you embrace every good thing without dismissing it, you will indeed be a child of Christ.
And now, my brothers, how can you grasp every good thing?
I now address that faith I mentioned; I will explain how you can seize every good thing.
God, who knows everything and has existed forever, sent angels to guide humanity, revealing the coming of Christ; and in Christ, every good thing will be realized.
God has also spoken directly to prophets, declaring that Christ would come.
He revealed many ways to teach humanity about good things, and all goodness comes from Christ; otherwise, people would have fallen and received no good.
Through the sending of angels and every word from God, people began to believe in Christ; in this way, through faith, they laid hold on every good thing until Christ arrived.
After His arrival, people were also saved by faith in His name; they became children of God through faith. And as surely as Christ lives, He told our ancestors: Whatever you ask the Father in my name, believing you will receive, it shall be granted to you.
So, my beloved brothers, have miracles stopped because Christ has ascended to heaven and sits at God’s right hand, claiming His rights of mercy for humanity?
For He has fulfilled the law’s requirements, claiming all who have faith in Him; those with faith will hold fast to every good thing; thus, He advocates for humanity, and He eternally resides in the heavens.
And because of this, my beloved brothers, have miracles ceased? I tell you, no; angels still minister to humanity.
For, behold, they follow His commands, appearing to those with strong faith and a sincere heart in every form of goodness.
Their role is to call people to repentance and fulfill the covenants God made with humanity, preparing the way among people by proclaiming Christ’s word to His chosen vessels so they can testify of Him.
In this way, God prepares for the rest of humanity to have faith in Christ so the Holy Ghost may enter their hearts, thus fulfilling the Father’s promises to humanity.
And Christ has said: If you have faith in me, you will have the power to achieve whatever is right in my name.
He also says: Repent, all ends of the earth, and come to me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me so you can be saved.
And now, my beloved brothers, if these things I speak are true, God will show you in power and glory on the last day that they are true; and if they are true, do miracles still happen?
Or have angels stopped appearing to people? Or has He kept the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will He withhold it as long as the earth stands or until someone is saved?
I say to you, no; because miracles are performed through faith, and angels appear and serve through faith; so, if these things have stopped, woe to humanity, for it is due to unbelief, and everything is meaningless.
No one can be saved unless they have faith in His name, according to Christ’s words; therefore, if these things have ceased, then faith has ceased too; and how terrible is humanity’s condition, as if redemption never existed.
But I say, my beloved brothers, I see better things in you; I believe you have faith in Christ because of your humility; if you did not have faith, you wouldn't belong among His church.
Moreover, my dear brothers, I want to discuss hope. How can you achieve faith if you lack hope?
And what should you hope for? I tell you that you can have hope through Christ's Atonement and the power of His resurrection, for eternal life, based on your faith in Him through His promise.
So, if a person has faith, they must have hope because without faith, hope cannot exist.
Furthermore, I say to you that one cannot have faith and hope unless they are humble and gentle in spirit.
If that is not the case, their faith and hope are meaningless, for God only accepts the humble and gentle; and if someone is humble and recognizes through the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, they must also have love; for without love, they are nothing; they must have love.
Love is patient, kind, does not envy, is not proud, does not seek its own interests, is not easily angered, does not hold onto wrongs, and rejoices in the truth, bearing all things, believing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things.
Therefore, my beloved brothers, if you do not have love, you are nothing; love never fails. So, hold tight to love, which is the greatest of all things, for everything else must eventually fail—
But love is the pure love of Christ, and it lasts forever; whoever possesses it on the last day will be in a good place.
So, my beloved brothers, pray to the Father with all your heart's energy that you may be filled with this love, which He gives to everyone who truly follows His Son, Jesus Christ; that you may become God’s children; that when He appears, we will be like Him, for we will see Him as He is; so we may have this hope; so we may be purified just as He is pure. Amen.
