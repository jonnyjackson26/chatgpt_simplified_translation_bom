This chapter explains how elders and priests serve the sacramental bread. About A.D. 401–21.
The way the elders and priests serve the body and blood of Christ to the church is described, and they did it following Christ's instructions; therefore, we know their method is correct; and the elder or priest served it—
They knelt down with the congregation and prayed to the Father in the name of Christ, saying:
O God, our Eternal Father, we ask you in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and make this bread holy for all who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of the body of your Son, and witness to you, O God, our Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon themselves the name of your Son, always remember him, and follow the commandments he has given them, so they may always have his Spirit with them. Amen.
