How to serve the wine—Look, they took the cup and said:
O God, our Eternal Father, we ask You, in the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and make this wine holy for everyone who drinks it, so they may remember the blood of Your Son that was given for them; that they may testify to You, O God, the Eternal Father, that they always remember Him, so that they can have His Spirit with them. Amen.
