A testimony of the Book of Mormon is given through the Holy Ghost—The gifts of the Spirit are given to those who are faithful—Spiritual gifts always come with faith—Moroni’s words will be heard even from the grave—Come to Christ, be perfected in Him, and purify your souls. About A.D. 421.
I, Moroni, am writing what I believe is important; I’m addressing my brothers, the Lamanites; I want them to understand that over four hundred and twenty years have passed since the sign of Christ’s coming was given.
I am sealing these records after sharing some encouraging words with you.
Please remember, as you read these words, if it’s God’s will that you should read them, to think about how merciful the Lord has been to humankind, from the time of Adam until now, and reflect on this in your hearts.
When you receive these teachings, I encourage you to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, whether they are true; if you ask sincerely and with real intent, having faith in Christ, He will reveal the truth to you through the Holy Ghost.
Through the Holy Ghost, you can discover the truth of everything.
Anything that is good is just and true; therefore, nothing good denies Christ, but rather acknowledges Him.
You can come to know Him through the power of the Holy Ghost; so I urge you not to reject God’s power because He acts according to the faith of His children, now and always.
Again, I urge you, my brothers, not to reject God's gifts, for there are many, all given by the same God. These gifts are shared in various ways, but it is the same God who works in all; they are provided by the Spirit of God for the benefit of everyone.
To one person, the Spirit of God gives the ability to teach wisdom;
To another, the ability to teach knowledge through that same Spirit;
To another, great faith; and to another, the ability to heal through that Spirit;
To another, the power to perform great miracles;
To another, the ability to prophesy about all things;
To another, the ability to see angels and ministering spirits;
To another, the ability to speak in different languages;
And to another, the ability to interpret languages and understand various tongues.
All these gifts come through the Spirit of Christ; and each person receives what they are allowed.
I urge you, my cherished brothers, to remember that every good gift comes from Christ.
I also urge you, my beloved brothers, to remember that He is unchanging—yesterday, today, and forever—and that all these spiritual gifts I spoke of will never cease as long as the world exists, except due to the disbelief of mankind.
For that reason, faith is essential; and where there is faith, there must also be hope; and if there is hope, there will be charity.
If you do not have charity, you cannot be saved in God’s kingdom; you cannot be saved there without faith, and likewise without hope.
If you lack hope, you must be in despair; and despair arises from wrongdoing.
Christ truly told our ancestors: If you have faith, you can accomplish all things that are necessary for me.
Now I address everyone across the earth—that if the day comes when God’s power and gifts are no longer among you, it will be due to disbelief.
Woe unto humanity if that happens; for there will be no one doing good among you, not a single person. Because if even one person among you does good, they will be able to do so through God’s power and gifts.
Woe to those who turn away from these things and then die, for they perish in their sins and cannot be saved in God’s kingdom; I declare this based on Christ's teachings, and I am not lying.
I urge you to remember these things; a time is coming swiftly when you will see that I am telling the truth, for you will stand before God, and He will ask you: Did I not declare my messages to you, as if crying from the grave, yes, as if speaking from the dust?
I state these things to fulfill the prophecies. And behold, they will come from the mouth of the everlasting God; His words will be passed down from generation to generation.
God will show you that what I have written is true.
Again, I urge you to come to Christ, embrace every good gift, and avoid evil and unclean things.
Wake up, rise from the dust, O Jerusalem; put on your beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; strengthen your foundations and expand your borders forever, so you will no longer be confused, and so the everlasting covenants made with you, O house of Israel, might be fulfilled.
Yes, come to Christ, be perfected in Him, and turn away from all ungodliness; if you turn from all ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind, and strength, then His grace will be enough for you, and through His grace, you may be perfect in Christ; if you are perfect in Christ through God’s grace, you cannot deny God’s power.
And again, if you are perfect in Christ through God’s grace and do not deny His power, you will be made holy in Christ by God’s grace, through the blood of Christ, as part of the Father’s covenant for the forgiveness of your sins, so that you become pure, without blemish.
Now I say goodbye to all. I will soon rest in God’s paradise until my spirit and body reunite, and I am brought forth in triumph through the air to meet you before the kind judgment of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both the living and the dead. Amen.
The End
