Elders appoint priests and teachers by placing their hands on them. This occurred around A.D. 401–21.  
This is how the disciples, known as the elders of the church, appointed priests and teachers—  
Once they had prayed to the Father in Jesus Christ's name, they placed their hands on them and declared:  
"In the name of Jesus Christ, I appoint you to be a priest (or if you are a teacher, I appoint you to be a teacher) to share the message of repentance and forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ, with faith in His name until the end. Amen."  
In this way, they appointed priests and teachers, based on the gifts and callings that God gives to people; they appointed them through the power of the Holy Ghost that was present in them.
