JESUS GAVE THE TWELVE NEPHITE DISCIPLES POWER TO CONFER THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. ABOUT A.D. 401–21.





THE WORDS OF CHRIST, WHICH HE SPAKE UNTO HIS DISCIPLES, THE TWELVE WHOM HE HAD CHOSEN, AS HE LAID HIS HANDS UPON THEM—

AND HE CALLED THEM BY NAME, SAYING: YE SHALL CALL ON THE FATHER IN MY NAME, IN MIGHTY PRAYER; AND AFTER YE HAVE DONE THIS YE SHALL HAVE POWER THAT TO HIM UPON WHOM YE SHALL LAY YOUR HANDS, YE SHALL GIVE THE HOLY GHOST; AND IN MY NAME SHALL YE GIVE IT, FOR THUS DO MINE APOSTLES.

NOW CHRIST SPAKE THESE WORDS UNTO THEM AT THE TIME OF HIS FIRST APPEARING; AND THE MULTITUDE HEARD IT NOT, BUT THE DISCIPLES HEARD IT; AND ON AS MANY AS THEY LAID THEIR HANDS, FELL THE HOLY GHOST.
