Jesus empowered the twelve Nephite disciples to give others the gift of the Holy Spirit. This happened around A.D. 401–21.
These are the words of Christ that he spoke to his chosen twelve disciples as he placed his hands on them—
He called them by name, saying: You should pray to the Father in my name with great faith; and after you do this, you will have the power to give the Holy Spirit to anyone upon whom you lay your hands. You will give it in my name, just like my apostles do.
At the time of his first appearance, Christ spoke these words to them; the crowd did not hear, but the disciples did, and the Holy Spirit came upon everyone they laid their hands on.
