I want to discuss baptism. Look, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized, but they were only baptized if they demonstrated good deeds that showed they were worthy. 
They were not accepted for baptism unless they approached with a humble and remorseful heart, and testified to the church that they truly repented for all their wrongdoings. 
No one was accepted for baptism unless they took upon themselves the name of Christ, showing a commitment to serve Him for the rest of their lives. 
After they were baptized and received the cleansing power of the Holy Spirit, they were recognized as part of the church of Christ; their names were recorded so they could be remembered and guided by the teachings of God, helping them stay on the right path and remain vigilant in prayer, relying solely on the grace of Christ, who is the source and end of their faith. 
The church met frequently to fast, pray, and discuss the well-being of their souls. 
They gathered often to share bread and wine as a reminder of the Lord Jesus. 
They were careful to ensure that no wrongdoing took place among them; if someone was found guilty of wrongdoing, and three witnesses from the church condemned them before the elders, and if they did not repent or confess, their names were removed, and they were no longer counted among the people of Christ. 
Whenever they repented and sought forgiveness sincerely, they were forgiven. 
Their meetings were led by the church following the guidance of the Spirit and the power of the Holy Ghost; as the Holy Ghost directed them on whether to preach, encourage, pray, plead, or sing, they acted accordingly.
