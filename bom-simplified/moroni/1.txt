I, Moroni, after finishing the summary of the story of the people of Jared, thought I wouldn’t write anything more, but since I’m still alive, I’m not telling the Lamanites who I am because they might kill me.
Look, their battles are really intense among themselves, and because they hate us, they execute every Nephite who refuses to reject Christ.
And I, Moroni, refuse to reject Christ, so I do whatever I can to stay safe and protect my life.
Therefore, I am writing a few more things, even though I initially thought I wouldn’t write again; I’m doing this hoping it might be helpful to my relatives, the Lamanites, in the future, based on what the Lord wants.
