THE BOOK OF MORONI



MORONI WRITES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LAMANITES—THE NEPHITES WHO WILL NOT DENY CHRIST ARE PUT TO DEATH. ABOUT A.D. 401–21.





NOW I, MORONI, AFTER HAVING MADE AN END OF ABRIDGING THE ACCOUNT OF THE PEOPLE OF JARED, I HAD SUPPOSED NOT TO HAVE WRITTEN MORE, BUT I HAVE NOT AS YET PERISHED; AND I MAKE NOT MYSELF KNOWN TO THE LAMANITES LEST THEY SHOULD DESTROY ME.

FOR BEHOLD, THEIR WARS ARE EXCEEDINGLY FIERCE AMONG THEMSELVES; AND BECAUSE OF THEIR HATRED THEY PUT TO DEATH EVERY NEPHITE THAT WILL NOT DENY THE CHRIST.

AND I, MORONI, WILL NOT DENY THE CHRIST; WHEREFORE, I WANDER WHITHERSOEVER I CAN FOR THE SAFETY OF MINE OWN LIFE.

WHEREFORE, I WRITE A FEW MORE THINGS, CONTRARY TO THAT WHICH I HAD SUPPOSED; FOR I HAD SUPPOSED NOT TO HAVE WRITTEN ANY MORE; BUT I WRITE A FEW MORE THINGS, THAT PERHAPS THEY MAY BE OF WORTH UNTO MY BRETHREN, THE LAMANITES, IN SOME FUTURE DAY, ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF THE LORD.
