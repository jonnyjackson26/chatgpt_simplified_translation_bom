The practice of baptizing little children is utterly wrong—Little children are innocent and safe in Christ because of his Atonement—Having faith, repenting, being humble, receiving the Holy Ghost, and persevering in faith will lead to salvation. Around A.D. 401–21.
This is a letter from my father Mormon, addressed to me, Moroni, and it was written soon after I began my ministry. He wrote to me like this:
My dear son, Moroni, I am incredibly glad that the Lord Jesus Christ has thought of you and has called you to serve in his ministry and his sacred work.
I always remember you in my prayers, constantly praying to God the Father, in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that, because of his amazing goodness and grace, he will help you stay strong in faith until the end.
Now, my son, I want to talk to you about something that greatly troubles me; it hurts me that there are arguments among you.
Because, if I have understood correctly, there have been disagreements among you about whether you should baptize your little children.
So, my son, I urge you to work hard to correct this serious mistake; I have written this letter for that purpose.
As soon as I learned about these things from you, I asked the Lord about the matter. The Lord answered me through the Holy Ghost, saying:
Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord, and God. I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repent; those who are well do not need a doctor, but those who are sick; so, little children are innocent, and they do not sin; thus, they are free from the curse of Adam through me, and the law of circumcision is no longer needed because of me.
This is how the Holy Ghost revealed God's word to me; therefore, my beloved son, I know that it is a grave insult to God that you should baptize little children.
I say to you that this is what you should teach—repentance and baptism for those who are accountable and capable of sin; yes, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and become humble like their little children, and then they will all be saved along with their little children.
And little children do not need to repent or be baptized. Remember, baptism is for those who are repenting and fulfilling commandments for forgiveness of sins.
But little children are alive in Christ, even from the very beginning; if not, God would be unfair, changeable, and show favoritism; for how many little children have died without baptism!
Therefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, they would have gone to an everlasting hell.
I say to you that anyone who thinks little children need baptism is deeply mistaken and is in a state of sin; they lack faith, hope, and charity; if they die while holding such beliefs, they will face hell.
It is incredibly wrong to believe that God saves one child because they are baptized, while another must suffer because they are not.
Woe to those who distort the ways of the Lord in this manner; they will perish unless they repent. I speak boldly under authority from God; I am not afraid of what people can do, for perfect love drives away all fear.
I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; hence, all children are the same to me; therefore, I love little children perfectly, and they all share in salvation.
For I know that God is not unfair; he does not change; he is constant from eternity to eternity.
Little children cannot repent; thus, it is terribly wrong to deny the pure mercies of God to them, as they are all alive in him due to his mercy.
Anyone who claims that little children need baptism denies Christ’s mercies and disregards his atonement and the power of his redemption.
Woe to them, for they risk death, hell, and endless torment. I speak this confidently; God has instructed me. Listen to them and pay attention, or you will stand against them when judged by Christ.
For all little children are alive in Christ, and so are all those who live without the law. The power of redemption is available to all who are not bound by the law; therefore, those who aren't condemned cannot repent; and for them, baptism means nothing—
Instead, it's mockery before God, denying Christ's mercies, the power of his Holy Spirit, and relying on meaningless actions.
Behold, my son, this should not be; for repentance is for those under condemnation and the consequences of breaking the law.
The first step of repentance is baptism; baptism comes through faith to fulfill commandments; fulfilling commandments brings forgiveness of sins;
And forgiveness of sins brings humility and a lowly heart; because of humility and a lowly heart comes the outpouring of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter who fills us with hope and perfect love, and that love continues with diligence in prayer until the end comes, when all the faithful will live with God.
My son, I will write to you again if I do not have to confront the Lamanites soon. The pride of our people, the Nephites, has led them toward destruction unless they repent.
Pray for them, my son, that they may find repentance. But I fear that the Spirit has stopped urging them; in this part of the land, they are also trying to eliminate all power and authority from God; they are rejecting the Holy Ghost.
After rejecting such great knowledge, my son, they will soon face destruction, fulfilling the prophecies spoken by the prophets and the words of our Savior himself.
Farewell, my son, until I write to you again or meet you once more. Amen.
