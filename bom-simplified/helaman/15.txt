The Lord corrected the Nephites because He cared for them—Converted Lamanites are strong and unwavering in their faith—In the last days, the Lord will show mercy to the Lamanites. About 6 B.C. 
And now, my dear brothers, I want to emphasize that if you do not change your ways, your homes will be left in ruins.
Yes, unless you repent, your women will have great reasons to mourn when they give birth; for when you try to escape, there will be no safe place to go; and woe to those who are pregnant, for they will be burdened and unable to flee; therefore, they will be trampled and left to die.
Yes, woe to the people called the Nephites unless they repent, especially when they witness all the signs and miracles that will be shown to them; for they have been a chosen people of the Lord; indeed, the Nephites have been loved by Him, and He has corrected them; yes, He has chastened them in times of their wickedness because of His love for them.
But you see, my brothers, the Lord has not loved the Lamanites due to their continual evil actions, stemming from the wrong traditions of their ancestors. Yet, salvation has reached them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this reason, the Lord has allowed them to continue living.
I want you to know that most of them are following the right path, living carefully before God, and trying to keep His commandments and laws based on Moses’s teachings.
Yes, I tell you that most of them are doing this, and they are working tirelessly to help the rest of their people learn the truth; therefore, many are joining their ranks daily.
And you know this to be true, for you have seen it: as many of them as come to know the truth and learn about the evil traditions of their fathers, and are led to trust in the holy scriptures and the prophecies of the holy prophets, which guide them to faith in the Lord and to repentance, which then brings about a change of heart—
Therefore, those who reach this understanding are known to be firm and steadfast in their faith and in the freedoms they have gained.
And you also know that they have laid down their weapons of war, fearing to pick them up lest they sin; indeed, you can see that they fear to sin—for they would rather be trampled and killed by their enemies than raise their swords against them, all because of their faith in Christ.
And now, because of their steadfastness in what they believe, the Lord will bless them and extend their lives, in spite of their wrongdoing—
Yes, even if they face moments of disbelief, the Lord will keep them living until the time spoken of by our ancestors, as well as by the prophet Zenos and many others, about the restoration of our brethren, the Lamanites, back to the knowledge of the truth—
Yes, I tell you that in the last days, the Lord’s promises have been given to our brethren, the Lamanites; and despite the many troubles they will endure, and although they will be tossed around the earth, hunted, and scattered without a place to find safety, the Lord will show them mercy.
This aligns with the prophecy that they will again come to the true knowledge, which is the understanding of their Redeemer, their great and true shepherd, and be counted among His flock.
Therefore, I tell you, it will be better for them than for you unless you repent.
For consider this: if the mighty works shown to you had been shown to them, those who have strayed in disbelief due to their fathers’ traditions would never have strayed again.
Therefore, the Lord declares: I will not completely destroy them, but I will bring them back to me in my chosen time.
And now, listen to what the Lord says concerning the Nephites: If they do not repent and do my will, I will completely destroy them, says the Lord, because of their disbelief, despite all the miracles I have performed among them; and as surely as the Lord lives, these things will come to pass, says the Lord.
