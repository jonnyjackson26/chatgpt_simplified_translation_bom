People can be unreliable, foolish, and quick to do wrong—The Lord corrects His people—The insignificance of humans is compared to God's power—On judgment day, people will either receive eternal life or eternal damnation. About 6 B.C.
We can see how false and unstable the hearts of people are; truly, we observe that the Lord, in His immense goodness, blesses and succeeds with those who trust in Him.
Indeed, we can see that at the very moment He blesses His people, in the increase of their farms, animals, wealth, and treasures; saving their lives and freeing them from their enemies; softening the hearts of their foes so they don’t wage war against them; ultimately, doing all things for the well-being and happiness of His people; yet, during this time, they harden their hearts, forget the Lord their God, and disrespect the Holy One—this happens because of their comfort and great prosperity.
Therefore, we see that unless the Lord puts His people through various difficulties, including death, fear, famine, and all kinds of diseases, they will not remember Him.
Oh how foolish, vain, evil, and quick to do wrong the children of men are; they are quick to listen to the words of evil and focus on the worthless things of the world!
Yes, they are quick to become prideful; quick to boast and engage in all sorts of wrongdoing; yet they are slow to remember the Lord their God and to listen to His guidance, very slow to follow the path of wisdom!
Look, they do not want their Creator, the Lord their God, to rule over them; despite His immense goodness and mercy toward them, they ignore His counsel and refuse to let Him be their guide.
Oh how insignificant the children of men are; they are even less than the dust on the earth.
For the dust of the earth moves back and forth, breaking apart, at the command of our great and everlasting God.
Yes, at His voice, the hills and mountains shake and tremble.
By the power of His voice, they break apart and become smooth, like a valley.
Yes, by His voice, the entire earth shakes;
Yes, by His voice, the foundations of the earth rock, even to its very core.
And if He tells the earth—Move—it moves.
If He tells the earth—Return, and stretch out the day for many hours—it happens;
Thus, according to His word, the earth moves back, making it seem to us that the sun stands still; indeed, this is true; for it is the earth that moves, not the sun.
Also, if He tells the waters of the deep—Be dry—it happens.
If He tells a mountain—Be raised up, come over, and fall on that city to bury it—it is done.
And if a person hides a treasure in the earth, and the Lord says—Let it be cursed because of the wrong done by the one who hid it—it will be cursed.
And if the Lord says—Be cursed, so that no one will find you from this time on and forever—no one will find it from that time onward.
And if the Lord says to a man—Because of your wrongs, you will be cursed forever—it will be so.
And if the Lord says—Because of your wrongs, you will be cut off from my presence—it will be done.
Woe to anyone to whom He says this, for it will be for those who commit wrong and cannot be saved; therefore, repentance has been declared so that people might be saved.
Blessed are those who repent and listen to the voice of the Lord their God; for these are the ones who will be saved.
May God, in His generosity, help people turn to repentance and good deeds, so they may be restored to grace for grace based on their actions.
I wish for all people to be saved. But we read that on the final day, some will be cast out, those who will be separated from the presence of the Lord;
They will be sent to a state of endless misery, fulfilling the words that say: Those who do good will receive everlasting life; and those who do evil will face everlasting damnation. And that is how it is. Amen.
