In the sixty-ninth year of the judges' reign over the Nephites, Nephi, Helaman's son, returned to Zarahemla from the northern lands.
He had been teaching the people in the north and delivering many prophecies to them;
But they rejected everything he said, so he could not remain there and went back to his homeland.
Seeing the people in such terrible wickedness and the Gadianton robbers taking control of the courts—taking power illegally and ignoring God's commandments, they were far from him; they were not administering justice to the people;
They condemned the righteous for their goodness; let the guilty go free because of their wealth; and kept positions of power in the government, ruling according to their desires to gain and achieve worldly glory, allowing them to commit adultery, steal, kill, and act according to their own wishes—
This great wickedness had arisen among the Nephites in just a few years; when Nephi witnessed it, he felt deep sorrow in his heart and cried out in anguish:
Oh, if only I could have lived in the days when my father Nephi first left Jerusalem, so I could have rejoiced with him in the promised land; back then, his people were easy to persuade, obedient to God's commandments, and slow to commit sin; they were quick to listen to the Lord's words—
If I had lived in those days, my soul would have rejoiced in the righteousness of my brothers.
But alas, I must accept that these are my days, and my soul will be filled with sorrow because of my brothers' wickedness.
Now it happened that Nephi was on a tower in his garden by the main road that led to the market in Zarahemla; he had bowed down on this tower, near the garden gate by the highway.
Some men passing by saw Nephi pouring out his heart to God on the tower; they ran and informed the people about what they had seen, and together they came in large numbers to understand the reason for such mourning over the people's wickedness.
When Nephi got up, he saw the huge crowd that had gathered.
He then opened his mouth and asked them: Why have you gathered here? Is it so I can tell you about your wrongdoings?
Yes, I've climbed this tower to pour out my soul to God, overwhelmed with sorrow for your sins!
You came together because of my mourning and lamentation, and you are amazed; yes, you have good reason to marvel; you should be shocked that the devil has gained such control over your hearts.
Yes, how could you allow yourselves to be tempted by the one who seeks to drag your souls into eternal suffering?
O repent, please! Why do you choose to die? Turn back to the Lord your God. Why has he turned away from you?
It's because you have closed your hearts; you will not listen to the voice of the good shepherd; you have angered him against you.
And instead of gathering you, unless you repent, he will scatter you, and you will become prey for dogs and wild animals.
O how could you forget your God on the very day he saved you?
But it is in your pursuit of gain, in seeking praise from others, and in striving for gold and silver. You have set your hearts on the riches and trivialities of this world, leading you to murder, plunder, steal, bear false witness, and commit all sorts of sins.
Because of this, woe will come to you unless you repent. If you refuse to change, this great city, along with all the other major cities in our land, will be removed, and you will have nowhere left; the Lord will no longer give you strength as he has before to resist your enemies.
For the Lord says: I will not reveal my power to the wicked more than to others, except to those who sincerely repent of their sins and listen to my words. Therefore, my brothers, know that it will be better for the Lamanites than for you if you do not repent.
For indeed, they are more righteous than you because they have not sinned against the great knowledge given to you; thus, the Lord will show mercy to them; he will prolong their days and increase their descendants, even when you face destruction unless you repent.
Yes, woe be unto you because of the great corruption in your midst; you have chosen to join that secret group established by Gadianton!
Yes, woe will come upon you because of the pride you have allowed to fill your hearts, raising you above what is good because of your immense wealth!
Yes, woe be unto you because of your wickedness and sins!
Unless you repent, you will perish; yes, your lands will be taken from you, and you will be wiped off the face of the earth.
Now, I do not declare these things by my own authority, for I know these truths not by my own strength; I know them because the Lord God has revealed them to me, and therefore I testify that they are true.
