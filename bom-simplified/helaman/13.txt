The message of Samuel, the Lamanite, to the Nephites.
This message consists of chapters through 15.
Samuel the Lamanite warns the Nephites of their destruction if they do not change their ways—Their wealth is cursed—They reject the prophets, are surrounded by evil spirits, and mistakenly look for happiness in sinful behavior. This was around 6 B.C.
In the eighty-sixth year, the Nephites continued in their wickedness, even to a great extent, while the Lamanites strictly followed God’s commandments as outlined in the law of Moses.
In that year, a man named Samuel, who was a Lamanite, came to Zarahemla and started preaching to the people. He spent many days calling for the people to repent, but they threw him out, and he was about to return home.
But the Lord spoke to him, giving him the command to go back and proclaim whatever He placed in his heart.
Since the people would not allow him to enter the city, he climbed onto the wall, raised his hand and shouted loudly, sharing the messages that God had inspired in him.
He told them: "I, Samuel, a Lamanite, speak the words the Lord has placed in my heart; He has instructed me to inform you that the sword of justice hangs over you, and in less than four hundred years, that sword will strike you down."
Indeed, severe destruction is coming for this people, and nothing can save them except they turn back to God and have faith in Jesus Christ, who will come into the world, experience great suffering, and be killed for His people.
An angel of the Lord has shown this to me, bringing joy to my soul. I was sent to share this news with you, so you too could have glad tidings; but you chose not to accept me.
Therefore, the Lord declares: Due to the stubbornness of the Nephites, unless they repent, I will take away my word from them, withdraw my Spirit, and allow them to suffer, while turning their brethren against them.
In less than four hundred years, I will ensure they face devastation; I will come among them in fierce anger, and your enemies will witness your complete destruction, unless you repent, says the Lord. Your enemies will witness your downfall.
But if you repent and return to the Lord your God, I will turn away my anger, says the Lord. Thus, the Lord says, blessed are those who repent and turn to me, but woe unto those who do not.
Woe unto the city of Zarahemla; it is saved only because of the righteous living among you. Indeed, woe to this city, as I perceive that most of its people are hard-hearted against me, says the Lord.
But blessed are those who repent; for their sake, I will spare the city. If it weren't for the righteous, I would send fire down from heaven to destroy it.
But it is for the righteous that the city is spared. The time will come, says the Lord, when you cast out the righteous among you; then you will be ready for destruction. Woe unto this great city for the wickedness and the sins dwelling within it.
Woe unto the city of Gideon for the wickedness and abominations present there.
Woe unto all cities surrounding the Nephites, for the wickedness and abominations that stain them.
The Lord of Hosts has decreed that a curse will come upon the land because of the wickedness and sins of its people.
The Lord of Hosts, our great God, promises that anyone who hides treasures in the earth will find them lost forever due to the grave curse on the land, unless they are righteous and dedicate them to the Lord.
The Lord desires that treasures be dedicated to Him; cursed is anyone who does not do this. Only the righteous bury their treasures with God, and those who do not, along with their treasures, will be cursed. None will redeem them because of the land’s curse.
There will come a day when they will hide their treasures due to their love of wealth; when they flee from their enemies, they will try to hide them but will not succeed; those who keep treasures from me will be cursed, along with their treasures; that day they will suffer, says the Lord.
Listen, people of this great city, and pay attention to my words; the Lord says you are cursed because of your wealth, and your wealth is also cursed because you value it more than your relationship with Him.
You forget the Lord your God and fail to thank Him for your blessings; your hearts do not reach out to Him, but swell with pride, leading to boasting, envy, conflict, malice, persecution, murder, and all kinds of sins.
This is why the Lord has brought a curse upon the land and on your wealth, all due to your sins.
Woe to this people for the time has come when you push away the prophets, mock them, throw stones at them, kill them, and commit all sorts of wickedness against them, just like they did in earlier times.
When you speak, you often say: If we had lived back in the days of our ancestors, we wouldn't have killed the prophets; we wouldn’t have cast them out or stoned them.
But you are worse than they were; for as the Lord lives, when a prophet comes to you bringing a word from God that reveals your sins, you get angry and throw him out, seeking to destroy him. You label him a false prophet, a sinner, and of the devil because he tells you the truth about your actions.
Yet, if someone comes and tells you to do whatever you want and that there’s no wrongdoing, you will gladly accept him and call him a prophet.
You will praise him, give him your wealth, your gold, your silver, and clothe him in fine clothes. Because he speaks flattering words and claims that all is well, you won’t criticize him.
Oh, wicked and perverse generation; how long do you think the Lord will tolerate you? How long will you allow yourselves to be guided by foolish and blind leaders? How long will you choose darkness instead of light?
Behold, the Lord is already angry with you; He has cursed the land because of your sins.
The time is coming when He will curse your riches making them unusable, and in times of need, you won't be able to keep hold of them.
During your poverty, you will cry out to the Lord; but your cries will be futile, for destruction has already come upon you, and your downfall is certain. Then you will weep and wail, says the Lord of Hosts. You will lament, saying:
"Oh, if only I had repented and not harmed the prophets, stoned them, or cast them out! In that day you will say: If only we had remembered the Lord our God when He blessed us with riches; then our wealth wouldn't have slipped from us."
Behold, every tool we place here today is gone tomorrow; our swords get taken from us just when we need them for battle.
We have stored our treasures, and they have slipped away from us because of the land's curse.
Oh, if only we had repented when the Lord's word came to us! Now the land is cursed, everything is slipping away, and we can’t grip it.
We are surrounded by evil spirits, encircled by the angels of the one who seeks to destroy our souls. Our sins are great. Oh Lord, can’t you turn your anger away from us? These will be your words in those days.
But your time for trial is over; you have put off your salvation until it’s too late, and your destruction is guaranteed; you have spent your lives chasing what you cannot have and seeking happiness in wrongdoing, which is the opposite of true righteousness.
Oh, people of this land, if only you would hear my words! I pray that the Lord's anger might turn away from you, and that you would repent and be saved.
