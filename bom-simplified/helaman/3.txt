In the forty-third year of the judges' reign, there was little conflict among the Nephites except for some pride within the church, which caused minor disagreements among the people; these issues were resolved by the end of that year.
During the forty-fourth year, there was no conflict among the people; there was also not much contention in the forty-fifth year.
However, in the forty-sixth year, there was much disagreement and many conflicts, causing a significant number of people to leave the land of Zarahemla and move to the north to settle there.
They traveled a great distance, reaching large bodies of water and many rivers.
They spread out all over the land, into any areas that had not been left barren and treeless by the many inhabitants who had previously lived there.
At that time, no part of the land was barren, except for the lack of trees; the destruction of the people who had once lived there was so great that it was known as desolate.
There was very little timber in the land, but the people who moved north became very skilled at working with cement, so they built cement houses to live in.
They multiplied and expanded, moving from the south to the north, and began to cover the entire earth, from the southern sea to the northern sea, and from the western sea to the eastern sea.
In the land northward, the people lived in tents and cement houses, allowing whatever trees grew to flourish so they could eventually use them as timber for building their cities, temples, synagogues, and all kinds of structures.
Due to the lack of timber in the north, they sent a lot of shipments by boat.
This allowed the people in the north to build many cities, both made of wood and cement.
Some of the Lamanites, descendants of Ammon, also moved into this land.
Many records were kept about the activities of this people by various individuals, which were detailed and extensive.
However, only a small portion of their records, including the accounts of the Lamanites and Nephites, their wars, disputes, preaching, prophecies, shipbuilding, cities, temples, synagogues, righteousness, wickedness, murders, thefts, plundering, and all kinds of evils and immoral acts, could fit in this work.
But there are many books and various types of records, mostly kept by the Nephites.
These records were passed down through generations by the Nephites until they fell into sin, were murdered, robbed, hunted down, driven away, killed, and scattered over the earth, mixing with the Lamanites until they were no longer called Nephites but became wicked, wild, and fierce, even turning into Lamanites.
Now I return to my account; what I have described occurred after there were significant conflicts, disturbances, wars, and disagreements among the Nephites.
The forty-sixth year of the judges ended;
And in the forty-seventh year, there was still significant conflict in the land, and this continued into the forty-eighth year.
Nevertheless, Helaman maintained the judgment seat with fairness and integrity; he made sure to uphold God's laws, statutes, and commandments, continually doing what was right in God's eyes, following the ways of his father, and prospering in the land.
He had two sons, naming the older Nephi and the younger Lehi, and they grew up serving the Lord.
As the wars and conflicts among the Nephites began to lessen towards the end of the forty-eighth year of the judges' reign.
In the forty-ninth year, continual peace was established in the land, except for the secret groups led by Gadianton the robber in the more settled areas, which were unknown to the leaders of the government at the time and therefore not eradicated from the land.
That same year, the church experienced remarkable growth, with thousands joining it and being baptized in repentance.
The church's prosperity and the blessings given to the people were so great that even the high priests and teachers were amazed.
The Lord's work flourished, leading many, even tens of thousands, to baptism and joining the church of God.
Thus, we see that the Lord is kind to all who genuinely call upon His holy name.
Indeed, the gate of heaven is open to all who believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
Anyone can grasp the word of God, which is living and powerful, cutting through all the schemes of the devil, guiding the followers of Christ along a straight and narrow path across the eternal chasm meant for the wicked—
And land their souls, their immortal souls, on the right side of God in heaven, where they will sit with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all our holy ancestors, never to leave.
In that year, there was continuous rejoicing in Zarahemla and all the surrounding areas, even throughout all the lands owned by the Nephites.
Peace and immense joy continued in the remainder of the forty-ninth year, as well as in the fiftieth year of the judges' reign.
During the fifty-first year of the judges' reign, there was also peace, except for the pride that began to seep into the church—not God's church, but into the hearts of those who claimed to belong to God’s church—
They became proud, even to the point of persecuting many of their fellow members. This was a great evil that caused the more humble members to suffer greatly and endure much hardship.
Despite this, they often fasted and prayed, becoming stronger in their humility and faith in Christ, filling their souls with joy and comfort, and purifying their hearts through surrendering to God.
The fifty-second year also ended in peace, except for the significant pride that had entered the people's hearts; it grew because of their great wealth and prosperity, increasing day by day.
In the fifty-third year of the judges' reign, Helaman died, and his oldest son Nephi took over. He filled the judgment seat with fairness and integrity, keeping God's commandments and walking in his father's ways.
