The Book of Helaman
This is a record about the Nephites. It tells of their wars, conflicts, and divisions, as well as the prophecies of many holy prophets before Christ came, based on the writings of Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, and including the accounts of his sons, reaching all the way to the time of Christ. It also details how many Lamanites were converted, describing their transformation and the righteousness they embraced, contrasted with the wickedness and sins of the Nephites, as recorded by Helaman and his sons, extending to Christ's coming, which is known as the book of Helaman, and so forth.
Pahoran the second becomes chief judge and is murdered by Kishkumen—Pacumeni takes over the judgment seat—Coriantumr leads the Lamanite armies, takes Zarahemla, and kills Pacumeni—Moronihah defeats the Lamanites and retakes Zarahemla, and Coriantumr is killed. About 52–50 B.C.
At the beginning of the fortieth year of the judges ruling over the Nephites, serious conflicts arose among them.
This happened because Pahoran had died and, like all mortals, had passed away. Consequently, a major dispute began about who should take over the leadership role from Pahoran’s brothers.
The names of those competing for the leadership were Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.
These three were not all of Pahoran's sons (for he had many), but they were the ones fighting for the leadership, causing divisions among the people.
Despite this, the people chose Pahoran to be the chief judge and governor of the Nephites.
Pacumeni, seeing that he couldn’t get the leadership role, decided to align himself with the people's choice.
However, Paanchi and his followers, who wanted him as their governor, were extremely angry; he planned to manipulate them into rebelling against their fellow Nephites.
As he was about to act on this plan, he was caught, put on trial by the people, and sentenced to death for instigating rebellion and trying to take away the people’s freedom.
When Paanchi’s supporters learned of his death sentence, they were furious. They sent a man named Kishkumen to the judgment seat of Pahoran, and he killed Pahoran while he was sitting there.
Kishkumen was chased by Pahoran’s servants, but he escaped so quickly that no one was able to catch him.
He returned to those who sent him, and they all made a pact, promising before God that they would keep quiet about how Kishkumen had killed Pahoran.
As a result, Kishkumen was unknown among the Nephites because he was disguised at the time of the murder. Kishkumen and his group mixed in with the people, making it hard for anyone to find them, although those who were discovered were sentenced to death.
Pacumeni was then appointed, by popular vote, to be the chief judge and governor, taking over for his brother Pahoran. This was his rightful place, and all of this took place in the fortieth year of the judges' reign, which concluded.
In the forty-first year of the judges' reign, the Lamanites assembled an overwhelming army of men, equipped with swords, daggers, bows, arrows, helmets, breastplates, and various types of shields.
They came down, intending to battle the Nephites, led by a man named Coriantumr, a descendant of Zarahemla and a former Nephite who had turned against his own people. He was a tall and strong man.
Therefore, the Lamanite king, Tubaloth, son of Ammoron, thought Coriantumr, being strong, could lead them to defeat the Nephites through his might and wisdom, believing that by sending him into battle he would gain control over the Nephites.
So, he incited his people to anger, gathered his armies, appointed Coriantumr as their leader, and commanded them to march down to Zarahemla to confront the Nephites.
Due to the internal strife and difficulties within their government, the Nephites did not have enough guards in Zarahemla, mistakenly believing that the Lamanites would not dare attack the heart of their territory.
However, Coriantumr led his vast army directly to the city, advancing with such speed that the Nephites had no time to rally their forces.
Coriantumr took down the guards at the city entrance, marched into the city with his entire army, and killed everyone who resisted, ultimately taking total control of the city.
Pacumeni, who was the chief judge, fled before Coriantumr to the city walls. Coriantumr struck him against the wall, resulting in his death, and thus ended Pacumeni's life.
When Coriantumr realized he had captured Zarahemla and that the Nephites were fleeing, being killed or taken prisoner, and that he now held the strongest position in the land, he became bold and planned to conquer the entire region.
Instead of staying in Zarahemla, he set out with a large army toward the city of Bountiful, determined to fight his way northward.
Assuming the Nephites' strongest warriors were in the central region, he marched straight into their land without giving them time to gather, attacking them in smaller groups as they came.
Coriantumr's march through the center of the land initially gave Moronihah an advantage, despite the significant number of Nephite casualties.
Moronihah had thought the Lamanites would not invade the center but would attack the border cities as they had done before, so he stationed Nephite forces at the borders to defend them.
But the Lamanites were bold and moved into the center, capturing Zarahemla and systematically slaughtering residents, including men, women, and children, taking over various cities and strongholds.
As soon as Moronihah learned of this, he immediately sent Lehi with an army to intercept the Lamanites before they reached Bountiful.
Lehi managed to cut off the Lamanites before they reached Bountiful and engaged them in battle, forcing them to retreat toward Zarahemla.
Moronihah similarly attacked them as they retreated, resulting in a very bloody battle with many fatalities, including Coriantumr himself.
The Lamanites found themselves unable to retreat in any direction, as they were surrounded by the Nephites from all sides.
Thus, Coriantumr led the Lamanites right into the Nephite forces, which resulted in their defeat, with Coriantumr killed, and the Lamanites surrendering to the Nephites.
Eventually, Moronihah regained control of Zarahemla and allowed the captured Lamanites to leave the land peacefully.
And this concluded the forty-first year of the judges' reign.
