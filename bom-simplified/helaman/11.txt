In the seventy-second year of the judges’ rule, conflicts grew so intense that wars broke out among all the people of Nephi.
This secret group of robbers was responsible for the ongoing destruction and evil actions. The war persisted throughout that year and continued into the seventy-third year.
During that year, Nephi cried out to the Lord, saying:
"O Lord, please don’t let this people be destroyed by fighting; instead, let there be a famine in the land to help them remember You, their God, so that they might repent and return to You."
And it happened just as Nephi asked. A severe famine plagued the land among all the people of Nephi. Thus, in the seventy-fourth year, the famine continued, and while the destruction by sword stopped, people suffered greatly from hunger.
The destruction continued into the seventy-fifth year. The earth was struck so that it became dry and produced no grain during the regular harvest season; this happened to all the land, affecting both the Lamanites and the Nephites, leading to the deaths of thousands in the more sinful regions.
As the people realized they were on the brink of dying from hunger, they began to remember the Lord their God and recalled Nephi's words.
The people pleaded with their chief judges and leaders to ask Nephi to pray to the Lord, saying, "We know you are a man of God, so please ask Him to take away this famine, or else what you have said about our destruction will come true."
The judges spoke to Nephi as the people desired. When Nephi noticed that the people had repented and humbled themselves in sackcloth, he called out to the Lord again, saying:
"O Lord, look, this people is repenting; they have driven out the Gadianton robbers to the point of their extinction and buried their secret schemes in the ground."
"Now, O Lord, please turn away Your anger and let it be calmed concerning the destruction of those wicked men who have already faced judgment."
"O Lord, will You please remove Your anger and stop this famine in the land?"
"O Lord, please listen to me and allow it to happen as I have asked, sending rain so that the earth can produce its fruits and grains in their harvest season."
"O Lord, You listened to me when I asked for a famine to stop the violence; and I trust that now, just as You promised, You will listen to me again, since You said that if this people repents, You will save them."
"Yes, O Lord, You see they have repented because of the hunger and destruction they have faced."
"And now, O Lord, will You turn away Your anger and see if they will serve You again? If they do, O Lord, You can bless them just as You have promised."
Then, in the seventy-sixth year, the Lord turned His anger away from the people and sent rain upon the earth, bringing forth its fruits in the proper seasons for harvest. The crops grew abundantly.
The people rejoiced and praised God, filling the land with happiness; and they no longer sought to harm Nephi but instead honored him as a great prophet and man of God, endowed with power and authority from God.
And Lehi, Nephi's brother, was equally righteous and respected.
Consequently, the people of Nephi began to thrive again in the land, rebuilding their destroyed places and multiplying, spreading until they covered the entire land, both north and south, from coast to coast.
The seventy-sixth year ended in peace, and the seventy-seventh year began peacefully; the church expanded across the land, with most people, both Nephites and Lamanites, joining the church, experiencing great peace in the land, thus concluding the seventy-seventh year.
They enjoyed peace in the seventy-eighth year, except for a few disputes regarding the doctrines put forth by the prophets.
In the seventy-ninth year, strife broke out again. However, Nephi and Lehi, along with many others who understood the true doctrines and received daily revelations, preached to the people and ended the conflicts in that same year.
In the eightieth year of the judges' rule, a group of dissenters from the Nephites, who had earlier joined the Lamanites and taken their name, began a war against their former people, inciting anger among the true Lamanites.
They committed murder and robbery, retreating into the mountains and wilderness to hide themselves, continuously growing in numbers from other dissenters who joined them.
Over time, not many years later, this group became a large band of robbers, uncovering the secret plans of Gadianton, thus becoming known as Gadianton robbers.
These robbers caused significant destruction among the Nephites and Lamanites.
Seeing the need to stop the violence, an army of strong men was sent into the wilderness and mountains to find and defeat this group of robbers.
However, that year, they were pushed back into their own territories, concluding the eightieth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites.
At the start of the eighty-first year, they once more went after the robbers, killing many, yet they suffered heavy losses themselves.
They had to retreat again from the wilderness and mountains back to their lands because the robbers had grown too powerful.
Thus, this year came to an end. The robbers continued to grow stronger, challenging all the armies of the Nephites and Lamanites, creating great fear among the people across the land.
They wreaked havoc in various regions, killing many and taking others captive into the wilderness, especially targeting women and children.
This great evil, a result of the people's sins, reminded them once again of the Lord their God.
And so the eighty-first year of the judges ended.
In the eighty-second year, the people began to forget the Lord again. In the eighty-third year, they grew stronger in their sins. By the eighty-fourth year, they didn’t change their bad ways.
In the eighty-fifth year, they became increasingly proud and wicked, leading them toward destruction once more.
Thus ended the eighty-fifth year.
