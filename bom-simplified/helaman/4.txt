In the fifty-fourth year, there was a lot of disagreement within the church, and the people were fighting so much that it led to much bloodshed.
The rebellious ones were killed and forced out of the land, and they went to the king of the Lamanites.
Then they tried to incite the Lamanites to go to war against the Nephites, but the Lamanites were very afraid and didn’t listen to these dissenters.
However, in the fifty-sixth year of the judges, some dissenters traveled from the Nephites to the Lamanites and managed to provoke them to anger against the Nephites, and they spent that entire year preparing for war.
In the fifty-seventh year, they came down to battle against the Nephites, starting a campaign of destruction; by the fifty-eighth year of the judges, they succeeded in taking control of the land of Zarahemla and all the surrounding territories, up to the area near land Bountiful.
The Nephites, along with Moronihah's armies, were pushed back into the land of Bountiful;
And there, they built defenses against the Lamanites, from the west sea to the east, which was considered a day’s journey for a Nephite, along the defensive line they set up to protect their northern territory.
Thus, these dissenters from the Nephites, with the considerable help of the Lamanites, managed to take over all the Nephite lands in the south. This happened during the fifty-eighth and fifty-ninth years of the judges’ reign.
Then, in the sixtieth year, Moronihah and his armies had some success in reclaiming various parts of the land, regaining several cities that the Lamanites had taken.
In the sixty-first year, they were able to reclaim about half of their total possessions.
The Nephites suffered great losses and bloodshed, which could have been avoided if it weren't for their wickedness and the evil present among them, including among those who claimed to be part of the Church of God.
Their downfall was due to their pride, their wealth, their oppression of the poor, their refusal to help the hungry and naked, hitting their humble brothers, mocking what was sacred, rejecting prophecy and revelation, and engaging in murder, theft, lying, adultery, and violent conflicts, leading many to abandon their faith and join the Lamanites in the land of Nephi.
Because of their great wickedness and their bragging about their strength, they were left to rely on their own power, resulting in failure; they were beaten and forced back by the Lamanites, and they nearly lost all their lands.
Moronihah preached many things to the people because of their wrongdoings, as did Nephi and Lehi, sons of Helaman, warning them about their sins and the consequences if they didn’t repent.
Eventually, they did repent, and as they turned from their sins, they began to thrive again.
Moronihah noticed their repentance and took them from one place to another, regaining about half of their properties and lands.
Thus, the sixty-first year of the judges came to an end.
In the sixty-second year of the judges, Moronihah was unable to reclaim any more land from the Lamanites.
So, they gave up on trying to take back the rest of their lands, since the Lamanites were too numerous, making it impossible for the Nephites to gain more control; instead, Moronihah focused all his forces on holding the territories he had captured.
Due to the large number of Lamanites, the Nephites were filled with fear, worried they would be overpowered, trampled, killed, or destroyed.
They began to recall the prophecies of Alma and the words of Mosiah; they realized they had been stubborn people who had ignored God's commandments.
They recognized that they had changed and disrespected the laws given to them through Mosiah, and that their laws had become corrupt, making them as wicked as the Lamanites.
Their wickedness led to a decline in the church; they started to doubt the spirit of prophecy and revelation, and God's judgments were clear before them.
They saw that they had grown weak, just like their Lamanite brothers, and that the Lord's Spirit no longer protected them; it had withdrawn because the Spirit of the Lord does not dwell in unholy places.
As a result, the Lord stopped preserving them with His miraculous power because they had fallen into disbelief and great wickedness; they realized the Lamanites were far more numerous, and unless they turned to the Lord, they would inevitably be lost.
They recognized that the strength of the Lamanites was equal to their own, man for man. Thus, they found themselves in this grave sin and had weakened due to transgression over a short period.
