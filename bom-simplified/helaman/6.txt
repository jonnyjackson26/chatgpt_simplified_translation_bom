When the sixty-second year of the judges ended, all these events had transpired, and most of the Lamanites had become a righteous people, surpassing the Nephites in their faithfulness and consistency in belief.
Many of the Nephites had become stubborn, unrepentant, and extremely wicked, rejecting God’s word and disregarding the preaching and prophecies among them.
Despite this, those in the church felt great joy due to the Lamanites’ conversion and the establishment of God’s church among them. They enjoyed fellowship and celebrated together, experiencing immense happiness.
Many Lamanites came to Zarahemla to share how they had converted and encouraged the Nephites to have faith and repent.
They preached powerfully, leading many to humble themselves and become devoted followers of God and His Son.
Many Lamanites also traveled north, along with Nephi and Lehi, to preach to the people there. And so the sixty-third year came to a close.
Peace prevailed throughout the land, allowing the Nephites to travel freely wherever they wanted, among both Nephites and Lamanites.
Likewise, the Lamanites could go wherever they wished, interacting freely with the Nephites for trade and profit.
As a result, both the Lamanites and Nephites became very wealthy, accumulating a great abundance of gold, silver, and all types of precious metals in both the southern and northern lands.
The southern land was named Lehi, and the northern land was called Mulek, after Zedekiah’s son; for the Lord brought Mulek into the northern territory and Lehi into the southern.
Both lands possessed various kinds of gold, silver, and precious ores, with skilled workers refining these materials, leading to their wealth.
They grew plenty of grain in both regions, flourishing greatly, increasing in strength and multiplying significantly. They also raised many livestock, including sizable herds.
Their women worked hard making all kinds of cloth, including fine linen, to cover their nakedness. Thus, the sixty-fourth year passed peacefully.
In the sixty-fifth year, they continued to experience great joy and peace, with much preaching and many prophecies about what was yet to come. The sixty-fifth year ended in this way.
In the sixty-sixth year of the judges, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown assailant while sitting in judgment. His son, whom the people had appointed to replace him, was also killed that same year. Thus, the sixty-sixth year concluded.
At the start of the sixty-seventh year, the people once again began to become very wicked.
The Lord had blessed them with so many worldly riches that they had not been incited to anger, wars, or violence; instead, they became focused on their wealth, seeking to elevate themselves above one another. Consequently, they began to commit secret murders, robberies, and looting to gain more.
These murderers and thieves were part of a group formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. Many, including some Nephites, aligned themselves with Gadianton’s band; however, they were more prevalent among the more wicked Lamanites. They were known as Gadianton’s robbers and murderers.
This group was responsible for the murders of Chief Judge Cezoram and his son while they were in office, and they were never caught.
When the Lamanites discovered that there were robbers among them, they were deeply saddened and tried everything in their power to eliminate them.
However, Satan stirred up most of the Nephites, leading them to unite with these robber bands and take oaths to protect and support one another in any difficulties they faced, ensuring they would not be punished for their murders, thefts, and other wrongdoings.
They established secret signs and words to recognize one another, ensuring a brother could act wickedly without fear of retaliation from fellow members of their band who had taken this covenant.
This allowed them to commit murder, theft, sexual immorality, and all kinds of wickedness, contrary to both their laws and the laws of God.
Anyone within their band who disclosed their wicked deeds would be judged not by the laws of the land but by the corrupt laws established by Gadianton and Kishkumen.
Alma commanded his son not to disclose these secret oaths and covenants to the world, fearing it would lead to the people's destruction.
These secret oaths and covenants didn’t come from the records given to Helaman but were instilled in Gadianton by the same being who enticed Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit—
Yes, this same being who convinced Cain to kill his brother Abel while keeping it hidden from the world, and he continued to plot with Cain and his descendants thereafter.
This being also influenced people to construct a tower high enough to reach heaven and led those who came from that tower to this land, promoting wickedness and abominations until the whole population faced destruction and eternal damnation.
Yes, it is this same being who inspired Gadianton to persist in his dark deeds and secret murders, a legacy that has lasted from the dawn of humanity to this day.
He is the source of all sin, perpetuating dark deeds, secret killings, and spreading plots, oaths, covenants, and plans of horrendous wickedness from generation to generation, as long as he can gain influence over the hearts of humans.
At that time, he held significant sway over the Nephites’ hearts; consequently, they became exceedingly wicked. Most turned away from the path of righteousness, disregarding God's commandments in favor of their selfish desires and crafted idols made of gold and silver.
All these immoral actions accumulated swiftly within just a few years, so much so that a significant portion had occurred by the sixty-seventh year of the judges.
Their sins increased further in the sixty-eighth year, causing great sorrow and lament from the righteous.
Thus, the Nephites began to decline in their belief and became more entrenched in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites were growing significantly in their understanding of God; they started to observe His laws and commandments, living truthfully and righteously before Him.
As a result, the Lord’s Spirit began to withdraw from the Nephites due to their wickedness and hardened hearts.
Conversely, the Lord began to pour out His Spirit on the Lamanites because of their openness and readiness to accept His words.
The Lamanites actively sought out Gadianton's band of robbers and preached God’s word among the more corrupt individuals, completely vanquishing this group from among the Lamanites.
On the other hand, the Nephites supported and nurtured the band of robbers, especially among the most wicked of their own, allowing the group to spread throughout Nephite territory and seducing many righteous individuals into believing in their ways, participating in their spoils, and joining them in their secret murders and plots.
As a result, the band gained complete control over the government, trampling the poor, meek, and faithful followers of God underfoot and abusing them.
Consequently, they were in a terrible state, ready for everlasting destruction.
Thus ended the sixty-eighth year of the judges over the people of Nephi.
