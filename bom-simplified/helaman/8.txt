As Nephi spoke these words, some judges who were part of the secret Gadianton group became furious and shouted to the crowd: Why aren't you arresting this man and bringing him forward to be punished for his actions?
Why do you allow this man to insult us and speak against our people and our laws?
Nephi had talked to them about how corrupt their laws were; he spoke many things that couldn't be written down, and nothing he said was contrary to God's commandments.
The judges were angry because he spoke openly about their secret evil deeds; still, they didn’t dare to harm him because they feared the people might turn against them.
So, they shouted to the crowd: Why do you let this man insult us? He condemns everyone to destruction and claims we will lose our great cities, leaving us with no place to call home.
But we know that this cannot happen, because we are strong and our cities are powerful, so our enemies cannot defeat us.
Thus, they stirred up the people against Nephi and caused arguments among them; some shouted: Leave this man alone, for he is a good man, and his words will certainly come true unless we repent.
Yes, all the judgments he warned us about will happen because he has rightly testified about our sins. He knows everything that will happen to us, just as he knows our wrongdoings.
And truly, if he were not a prophet, he wouldn't be able to speak about those future events.
The people who wanted to harm Nephi were afraid, so they didn't attack him; seeing that he had some supporters, he started speaking to them once more, knowing that the rest now feared him.
So he felt compelled to say: Brothers, haven’t you read that God gave one man, Moses, the power to strike the waters of the Red Sea, causing them to part so that the Israelites, our ancestors, could walk through on dry ground? The waters then closed over the Egyptian armies and destroyed them.
Now, if God gave such power to Moses, why are you arguing and claiming he hasn’t given me the ability to know the judgments that will come upon you unless you repent?
But you not only deny what I say, you deny the words of our ancestors and the words of Moses, who was given great power, and the visions he had about the coming of the Messiah.
Did he not testify that the Son of God would come? And just as he lifted up the copper snake in the wilderness, so too will the one who is to come be lifted up.
And just as those who looked at the snake lived, so everyone who looks upon the Son of God with faith and a humble spirit can have eternal life.
And remember, Moses did not just testify of these things; all the holy prophets from his time to Abraham also did.
Yes, and Abraham knew of his coming and was filled with joy.
And I tell you, Abraham was aware of these matters, but there were many others before him chosen by God, even those after the order of his Son, to show the people thousands of years ahead of time that redemption would come.
And I want you to know that since the days of Abraham, many prophets have testified about these things; the prophet Zenos boldly declared them and was killed for it.
Also Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, who warned of Jerusalem's destruction, and we see that Jerusalem was indeed destroyed as Jeremiah foretold. So why wouldn’t the Son of God come as prophesied?
Will you argue that Jerusalem was not destroyed? Will you say that Zedekiah's sons were not killed, except for Mulek? And don’t you see that Zedekiah’s descendants are among us, driven away from Jerusalem? But that’s not all—
Our father Lehi was forced out of Jerusalem because he spoke about these things. Nephi also testified, as did almost all our ancestors down to this day; they have looked forward to Christ's coming and rejoiced at the thought of it.
And he is God, and he was with them, showing them that they were redeemed by him; they glorified him for what was to come.
Now that you know these truths and can’t deny them unless you lie, you have sinned by rejecting them, even with the many signs you've received; you’ve witnessed so much in heaven and on earth that is true.
But you have turned away from the truth and rebelled against your holy God; instead of building up treasures in heaven, which cannot spoil or be touched by impurity, you are gathering your own punishment for the day of judgment.
Yes, right now you are becoming ripe for everlasting destruction because of your murders, sexual immorality, and wickedness; unless you repent, it will soon come upon you.
Yes, it is right at your doorstep; go to the judgment seat and see for yourself; your judge has been killed and lies in his blood; his brother, who wants to take the judgment seat, murdered him.
And they are both part of your secret society, whose leader is Gadianton, the evil one who seeks to destroy the souls of men.
