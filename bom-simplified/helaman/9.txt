After Nephi spoke these words, some men among the crowd hurried to the judgment seat; there were five of them, and they whispered to one another as they ran:
Now we will finally know for sure if this man is a prophet and if God has really told him to speak such amazing things to us. We don’t believe he is a prophet; however, if what he said about the chief judge being dead is true, then we will trust that the other things he said are also true.
They rushed to the judgment seat, and when they arrived, they found the chief judge lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood.
When they saw this, they were extremely shocked, so much so that they fell to the ground; they hadn't believed Nephi's words about the chief judge.
But once they saw the truth, they believed, and fear took hold of them because they worried that all the judgments Nephi had warned about would come upon them. As a result, they trembled and fell to the ground.
Right after the judge was murdered—the victim being stabbed by his brother in secret—he fled, and the servants ran to tell everyone, shouting that there had been a murder;
The people gathered at the judgment seat, and to their surprise, they saw the five men lying on the ground.
The people were unaware of the large crowd that had assembled in the garden of Nephi, so they whispered to one another: These men are the ones who murdered the judge, and God has struck them down so they could not escape.
They seized the five men, tied them up, and threw them into prison. An announcement was made to everyone that the judge was dead and that the murderers had been captured and jailed.
The next day, the people gathered to mourn and fast for the burial of the great chief judge who had been killed.
Those judges who had been in the garden of Nephi and had heard his words were also gathered for the burial.
They asked the crowd: Where are the five men who were sent to check if the chief judge was dead? The people replied: About the five you mention, we don’t know where they are; but we do have five murderers locked up in prison.
The judges wanted the five men to be brought to them; and they were brought forth, only to discover that they were indeed the same five who had been sent. The judges asked them what happened, and they explained:
We rushed to the judgment seat, and when we found everything just as Nephi had said, we were so astonished that we fell to the ground. When we regained our composure, we were thrown into prison.
As for the murder, we don’t know who did it, but we did come as you requested, and it is true that he was dead, just as Nephi said.
The judges then explained to the people what had happened and yelled out against Nephi, saying: Look, we know that this Nephi must have conspired with someone to kill the judge, so he could tell us about it to convert us to his beliefs and elevate himself as a chosen prophet of God.
We will expose this man, and he will confess and reveal the real murderer of the judge.
On the day of the burial, the five men were set free. However, they scolded the judges for their accusations against Nephi, challenging them one by one to the point of confusion.
Despite this, they ordered Nephi to be captured and tied up to stand before the crowd, where they began questioning him in various ways to catch him in a lie and to ultimately accuse him of murder—
They demanded: You must have worked with someone; who did this murder? Now confess your wrongdoing; look, here’s money; we’ll spare your life if you admit what you did!
Nephi responded: You foolish people with uncircumcised hearts, you blind and stubborn folks, do you not understand how long the Lord will tolerate you continuing in your sinful ways?
You should start crying out in grief because of the imminent destruction that awaits you unless you repent.
You claim I conspired with a man to murder Seezoram, our chief judge. But I say this is only because I warned you about the wrongdoings that exist among you, as a witness of the wickedness you possess.
And since I have done this, you accuse me of colluding to commit this act; yes, you are angry with me for revealing this sign, and you want to take my life.
Now I will give you another sign to see if you will still try to destroy me.
I tell you: Go to the house of Seantum, the brother of Seezoram, and ask him—
Did Nephi, the false prophet who speaks so much evil about this people, conspire with you in the murder of Seezoram, your brother?
And he will say to you, No.
You will then ask: Did you kill your brother?
He will stand there in fear and won’t know what to say. He will deny it and seem shocked; however, he will claim he is innocent.
But you will investigate him and find blood on the hem of his cloak.
When you see this, you will ask: Where did this blood come from? Don’t you realize it is the blood of your brother?
Then he will tremble and turn pale, as if death has struck him.
You will then declare: Because this fear and paleness have come upon you, we know you are guilty.
And even greater fear will come upon him; he will then confess and no longer deny that he committed the murder.
He will say that he knows nothing about it except what has been revealed to him through the power of God. Then you will recognize that I am an honest man sent to you from God.
They followed Nephi’s instructions, and what he said came to pass; he denied and later confessed just as Nephi had foretold.
He was proven to be the actual murderer, resulting in the five men being set free, as well as Nephi.
Some Nephites believed Nephi's words, while others believed because of the testimony of the five, as they had been converted during their time in prison.
Some among the people said Nephi was a prophet.
Others claimed: Look, he must be divine, for no one could know all this unless they were a god. He has revealed our innermost thoughts and has informed us of the true killer of our chief judge.
