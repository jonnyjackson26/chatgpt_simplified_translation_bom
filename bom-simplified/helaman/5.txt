In the same year, Nephi handed over the leadership position to a man named Cezoram.
Since their laws and government were shaped by the people's voice, and those who chose evil were more numerous than those who chose good, they were heading toward destruction due to the corruption of their laws.
Indeed, they were such a stubborn people that they could not be governed by law or justice without leading to their own ruin.
Nephi grew tired of their wickedness, so he stepped down from his leadership role and committed himself to preaching God’s word for the rest of his life, as did his brother Lehi.
They recalled the advice given to them by their father Helaman, which was:
“Listen, my sons, I hope you remember to keep God’s commandments, and I want you to share these words with the people. I’ve given you the names of our first parents who came from Jerusalem so that when you think of your names, you may remember those good ancestors and their good deeds.”
Therefore, my sons, I hope you do good things so that it can be said of you, just like it has been said of them.
And now, my sons, I want to ask something more of you. Don’t do good just to boast, but do good to build a treasure in heaven that lasts forever. I want you to receive the precious gift of eternal life, which we believe has been given to our ancestors.
Oh, remember the words that King Benjamin spoke to his people. Remember, there is no other way to be saved except through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who will come to redeem the world.
Also, remember what Amulek said to Zeezrom in the city of Ammonihah—that the Lord will come to save His people, but not to redeem them in their sins, but to save them from their sins.
He has been given power from the Father to remove their sins through repentance. That’s why He sent angels to share the message of repentance, which leads to the Redeemer’s power and the salvation of their souls.
And now, my sons, remember that you must build your foundation on the rock of our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, the Son of God. When temptations come like strong winds and storms, they will not overpower you if you are built upon this solid foundation, which ensures that if you build upon it, you cannot fall.
These are the teachings Helaman shared with his sons, and he taught them many things, both written and unwritten.
They remembered his words and went out to keep the commandments of God and share His word among all the people of Nephi, starting in the city of Bountiful.
From there, they traveled to the city of Gid; and then from Gid to the city of Mulek;
They moved from one city to another until they reached all the people of Nephi in the southern land, including Zarahemla among the Lamanites.
They preached with such great power that they astonished many dissenters who had joined the Lamanites, leading them to confess their sins and be baptized in repentance, seeking to make amends with the Nephites for their past wrongs.
Nephi and Lehi preached to the Lamanites with great authority and power, which had been given to them, and they were told what to say.
So they spoke with such amazement that about eight thousand Lamanites in and around Zarahemla were baptized unto repentance and recognized the wickedness of their ancestors' traditions.
Then, Nephi and Lehi went on to the land of Nephi.
However, they were captured by a Lamanite army and thrown into the same prison where Ammon and his brothers had been held by King Limhi's servants.
After being in prison for many days without food, their captors came to take them out to kill them.
But Nephi and Lehi were surrounded by fire as if they were in flames, and their captors were too afraid to touch them for fear of burning. Yet, Nephi and Lehi were unharmed, standing there as if in fire without being hurt.
When the Lamanites saw this miraculous sight, their courage was restored.
They realized they couldn't approach Nephi and Lehi, standing there in awe and amazement.
Nephi and Lehi spoke to them, saying: "Don’t be afraid. God has shown you this amazing miracle to prove you cannot harm us."
Just then, as they spoke, the earth shook, and the walls of the prison trembled as though they might fall, but they did not collapse. Among those present were Lamanites and Nephites who had turned away from their faith.
They were covered by a cloud of darkness that filled them with fear.
Then, a voice came from above the darkness, saying: "Repent, repent, and do not seek to destroy my servants whom I have sent to share good news with you.”
When they heard this voice, they realized it was not a thunderous noise, but a gentle voice, quiet like a whisper, which pierced straight through to their souls.
Despite the gentleness of the voice, the earth shook violently, and the prison walls trembled yet again, surrounded by the persistent cloud of darkness that remained with them.
Then the voice spoke again: "Repent, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is close; stop trying to destroy my servants." The earth shook again, and the walls trembled.
The third time, the voice offered incredible words beyond what any human could express; once again, the walls trembled, and the earth shook as if it might split apart.
The Lamanites couldn’t escape because of the enveloping darkness, and they were rooted in place by the fear that overtook them.
Among them was a Nephite man who had once been part of the church but had since turned away.
He turned around and, through the darkness, saw the glowing faces of Nephi and Lehi, shining like angels. They were looking up, appearing to speak or lift their voices to someone above them.
This man shouted to the crowd, urging them to look. They were miraculously able to turn and see the radiant faces of Nephi and Lehi.
They asked him: "What do all these wonders mean, and who are these men talking to?"
The man’s name was Aminadab. He replied: "They are speaking with the angels of God."
The Lamanites then asked Aminadab: "What must we do to remove this darkness holding us captive?"
Aminadab told them: "You need to repent and call on the voice until you have faith in Christ, taught to you by Alma, Amulek, and Zeezrom. If you do this, the darkness will be lifted."
And so, they all began to cry out to the voice that had shaken the earth, pleading until the darkness was removed.
When they looked around and saw that the cloud of darkness had lifted, they discovered they were surrounded by a pillar of fire.
Nephi and Lehi stood among them, encircled in flames, yet they remained unharmed, nor did the fire affect the walls of the prison; they experienced indescribable joy and glory.
Then, the Holy Spirit descended from heaven and filled their hearts as if with fire, allowing them to speak in marvelous ways.
Then a gentle voice, like a whisper, said to them:
"Peace, peace be unto you because of your faith in my Beloved Son, who has been from the very beginning of the world."
When they heard this, they looked up to see where the voice was coming from; the heavens opened, and angels descended to minister to them.
Around three hundred people witnessed and heard these events, and they were encouraged to go forth without fear or doubt.
They went out ministering to the people, sharing everything they had seen and heard, which led many Lamanites to believe, because of the overwhelming evidence they had experienced.
Those who were convinced laid down their weapons of war, their hatred, and the traditions of their ancestors.
In turn, they surrendered their lands to the Nephites.
