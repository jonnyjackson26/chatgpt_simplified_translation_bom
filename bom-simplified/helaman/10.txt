There was a disagreement among the people, causing them to scatter in different directions and leave Nephi standing alone in their midst.
Nephi then went home, reflecting on the things the Lord had shown him.
While he was deep in thought, feeling troubled by the wickedness of the Nephites—their secret sins, murders, thefts, and all kinds of wrongdoing—a voice spoke to him.
The voice said: You are blessed, Nephi, for what you have done; I have seen how tirelessly you have shared the word I gave you to this people. You have not been afraid of them, you have not sought to protect your own life, but you have sought my will and followed my commandments.
Since you have done this with such diligence, I will bless you forever; I will make you strong in your words and actions, in faith and deeds; indeed, whatever you say will be done according to your word, as long as you do not ask for things against my will.
Listen, you are Nephi, and I am God. I proclaim to you in front of my angels that you will have power over this people, and you will strike the earth with famine, plagues, and destruction according to their wickedness.
I give you the power that whatever you seal on earth will also be sealed in heaven, and whatever you loosen on earth will also be loosened in heaven; thus you will have authority among this people.
If you say to this temple that it should be torn apart, it will happen.
If you command this mountain to be thrown down and made smooth, it will happen.
And if you say that God will punish this people, it will occur.
Now, I command you to go and tell this people that the Lord God, the Almighty, says: Unless you repent, you will face destruction.
After the Lord spoke these words to Nephi, he paused and chose not to go home; instead, he returned to the crowd scattered across the land and started delivering the message from the Lord, warning them of destruction if they did not repent.
Despite the great miracle Nephi performed by revealing the death of the chief judge, the people hardened their hearts and refused to listen to the Lord's words.
So Nephi continued to tell them what the Lord said: Unless you repent, the Lord declares, you will face destruction.
After Nephi delivered this message, the people still hardened their hearts and ignored him; they began to insult him and sought to imprison him.
However, God's power was with him, and they couldn't capture him to imprison him, for he was taken by the Spirit and removed from their midst.
Nephi then moved from group to group, in the Spirit, sharing the word of God until he had communicated it to all people.
Yet, the people refused to listen to his words; soon there was fighting among them, causing divisions and leading to them killing one another with swords.
And so ended the seventy-first year of the judges' rule over the Nephites.
