The Book of Jacob the Brother of Nephi
These are the words he preached to his brothers. He silences someone trying to argue against the teachings of Christ. A brief recounting of the history of the Nephites follows.
Jacob and Joseph strive to convince people to believe in Christ and follow His commandments—Nephi passes away—Wickedness increases among the Nephites. About 544–421 B.C.
Fifty-five years had passed since Lehi left Jerusalem; thus, Nephi instructed me, Jacob, to write on these small plates, which contain these accounts.
He commanded me to write a few of the most valuable things on these plates; I should only lightly touch on the history of the Nephite people.
He explained that the history of his people should be recorded on other plates and that I should take care of these plates and pass them down to my descendants for generations.
If there were sacred preachings, significant revelations, or prophecies, I was to record their main ideas on these plates, mentioning them as much as possible for the sake of Christ and our people.
Because of our faith and deep concern, it was shown to us what would happen to our people.
We received many revelations and experienced the spirit of prophecy; thus, we knew about Christ and His coming kingdom.
Because of this, we worked hard among our people to persuade them to come to Christ and experience God's goodness so they could find peace, lest they face God's wrath and be denied entry as the Israelites were in the wilderness.
Therefore, we wished for everyone to choose not to rebel against God, to avoid provoking His anger, but instead to believe in Christ, witness His death, endure His suffering, and bear the scorn of the world; so, I, Jacob, take on the task given to me by my brother Nephi.
As Nephi aged and realized his death was near, he appointed a man to be king and ruler over his people following the tradition of kings.
The people loved Nephi greatly because he had been a strong protector for them, using the sword of Laban in their defense, and working tirelessly for their well-being—
Consequently, the people wanted to remember his name. Those who succeeded him as king were referred to by the people as second Nephi, third Nephi, and so on, based on the lines of kings; thus, they were called according to what the people chose, regardless of their actual names.
Then Nephi passed away.
The people who were not Lamanites were Nephites; however, they were also known as Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.
But from now on, I, Jacob, will not use these names to categorize them; I will call those who seek to harm the Nephites "Lamanites," and those who are supportive of Nephi will simply be known as Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the royal line.
Now it happened that during the reign of the second king, the Nephites grew stubborn and began to engage in wicked behaviors, similar to those of David and his son Solomon, like wanting many wives and concubines.
Indeed, they started to seek after gold and silver and became somewhat prideful.
Therefore, I, Jacob, spoke these words to them as I taught them in the temple, having first received my instructions from the Lord.
For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph were appointed as priests and teachers of this people by Nephi.
We took our responsibilities seriously before the Lord, understanding that if we didn’t teach them the word of God diligently, we would be accountable for their sins; therefore, through our efforts, we aimed to ensure that their blood would not be on our hands; otherwise, we would not be found clean on the final day.
