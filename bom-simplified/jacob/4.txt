All the prophets honored God the Father by recognizing Christ—Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac was a symbol of God and His Only Begotten Son—People should make peace with God through Christ's Atonement—The Jews will turn away from the cornerstone, about 544–421 B.C.
Look, I, Jacob, have spoken a lot to my people with my words, (and I can only write a little because it’s difficult to engrave them onto metal plates) and we understand that what we write on these plates must remain;
But anything else we write, except on these plates, will disappear and be lost; yet we can engrave a few words on plates to provide our children, and also our dear brothers, with some knowledge about us or their ancestors—
We take joy in this effort; we work hard to engrave these words onto the plates, hoping that our dear brothers and children will accept them with gratitude and look upon them to learn with happiness, not sadness or contempt, about their first parents.
We write these things so they may understand that we knew about Christ, and we hoped for His glory many centuries before He came; and not just we ourselves hoped for His glory, but all the holy prophets before us did as well.
Look, they believed in Christ and honored the Father in His name, and we do the same. This is why we observe the law of Moses; it guides our souls toward Him; and for this reason, it is regarded as righteous for us, just as it was for Abraham in the wilderness when he obediently offered his son Isaac, symbolizing God and His Only Begotten Son.
This is why we study the prophets, receive many revelations, and have the spirit of prophecy; and with all these witnesses, we gain hope, and our faith becomes strong enough that we can truly command in the name of Jesus, and even the trees obey us, along with the mountains and the waves of the sea.
Still, the Lord shows us our weaknesses so we know that it is through His grace and His immense kindness to us that we have the power to do these things.
Look, the Lord’s works are great and amazing. How unfathomable are His mysteries, and it’s impossible for man to fully understand His ways. No one can know His ways unless He reveals them; therefore, my brothers, don’t disregard the revelations of God.
For look, by the power of His word, man was placed on the earth, which was created by His word. So if God can simply speak and the world exists, or speak and create man, why would He not be able to command the earth and its creations as He wishes?
Therefore, my brothers, do not try to advise the Lord; instead, take guidance from Him. For you know well that He counsels with wisdom, justice, and great mercy over all His creations.
So, dear brothers, reconcile yourselves to Him through the Atonement of Christ, His Only Begotten Son, so you may gain resurrection through His power and be presented before God as the first fruits of Christ, having faith in Him and a good hope of glory before He reveals Himself in the flesh.
Now, beloved, do not be surprised that I share these things; why not discuss Christ’s Atonement and gain a complete understanding of Him, just as we can learn about resurrection and the world to come?
Listen, my brothers, if someone prophesies, they should do so clearly so people can understand; for the Spirit conveys truth and doesn’t lie. It speaks of things as they truly are and will be; thus, these truths are revealed to us plainly for the salvation of our souls. But we are not the only witnesses to these truths; God spoke them to the prophets of old as well.
But behold, the Jews were stubborn people; they rejected clear messages, killed the prophets, and sought after things they couldn’t comprehend. Because of their blindness, which came from looking too far and missing the point, they must inevitably fall; for God has removed clarity from them, giving them many things they cannot grasp because that is what they wanted. And since they desired this understanding, God allowed it, so they may stumble.
And now I, Jacob, feel inspired to prophesy; I sense from the Spirit within me that through the Jewish stumbling, they will reject the rock on which they could build a secure foundation.
But look, according to the scriptures, this rock will become the great, final, and only assured foundation upon which the Jews can build.
And now, dear ones, how can they possibly build upon this foundation after having rejected it, so it can become the cornerstone for them?
Listen, my beloved brothers, I will reveal this mystery to you; as long as I do not lose my resolve in the Spirit or become overly anxious for you.
