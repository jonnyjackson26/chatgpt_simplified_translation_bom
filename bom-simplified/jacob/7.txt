After some time had passed, a man named Sherem came among the people of Nephi.
He started preaching to the people, claiming that there would be no Christ. He taught many flattering things to the people in order to undermine the teachings of Christ.
He worked hard to lead the people's hearts away from their faith, successfully leading many away. Knowing that I, Jacob, believed in Christ who would come, he sought many chances to speak with me.
Sherem was very educated and knew the people's language perfectly, allowing him to use flattery and persuasive speech, influenced by the power of the devil.
He hoped to weaken my faith, despite all the revelations and experiences I had regarding these matters. I had truly seen angels who had helped me, and I had heard the Lord speak to me directly at different times, so I remained firm in my beliefs.
Then he approached me and spoke, saying: Brother Jacob, I have been looking for a chance to talk to you because I’ve heard that you travel around preaching what you call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.
And you have convinced many people to stray from the true path of God and ignore the law of Moses, which is the correct way. You turn the law of Moses into the worship of a being that you say will come many hundreds of years from now. Now, I, Sherem, tell you that this is blasphemy; because no one knows such things. No one can predict the future. And this is how Sherem argued against me.
But then, the Lord filled me with His Spirit, and I was able to refute everything he said.
So I asked him: Do you deny the Christ who will come? He replied: If there were a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know there is no Christ, nor has there ever been or will be.
I asked him: Do you believe in the scriptures? He answered, Yes.
I said: Then you must not understand them; because they truly testify about Christ. None of the prophets have written about anything that doesn’t relate to this Christ.
And that's not all — I have received revelation and insights; I know through the power of the Holy Spirit that without an atonement, all of mankind is doomed.
He then challenged me: Show me a sign through the power of the Holy Spirit that you claim to know so much about.
I said to him: Why should I put God to the test to show you a sign of something you already know is true? Even so, you would reject it because you are influenced by the devil. Nevertheless, let it not be my will but if God chooses to strike you down, let that serve as a sign to you of His power in heaven and on earth, and also that Christ will come. May Your will be done, O Lord.
When I, Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon him, and he fell to the ground. For several days, he remained weakened.
He then instructed the people to gather the next day, saying that he would die and wanted to speak to them before he passed away.
The next day, the crowd assembled, and he spoke plainly to them, rejecting the teachings he had spread and confessing the truth about Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the ministry of angels.
He made it clear to them that he had been misled by the devil's influence. He spoke about hell, eternity, and eternal punishment.
He said: I fear I may have committed the unforgivable sin because I have lied to God; I denied Christ while claiming to believe in the scriptures, which truly testify of Him. Now I am greatly afraid of the consequences for my actions, but I confess my wrongdoing to God.
After saying these words, he could say nothing more and died.
When the crowd saw him speak this way as he was passing away, they were extremely astonished, and the power of God came upon them, causing many to fall to the ground.
This pleased me, Jacob, because I had asked my Father in heaven for this, and He had heard my prayer.
Then, peace and the love of God returned to the people; they began to study the scriptures again and no longer listened to the words of this wicked man.
Many efforts were made to bring the Lamanites back to the truth; however, all proved fruitless because they thrived on violence and maintained a deep-seated hatred towards us, their own brethren. They continually tried to destroy us through force.
Therefore, the Nephite people armed themselves and prepared to defend against them, trusting in God as their foundation, and thus, they became victors over their enemies.
As I, Jacob, started to grow old and knowing that the records of our people were kept on other plates, I conclude this record. I assert that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, reflecting on how quickly time has passed, and how our lives slipped away like a dream. We have been a lonely and serious people, cast out from Jerusalem, born into hardship, rejected by our own brethren which led to warfare and disputes; hence, we mourned throughout our days.
I, Jacob, recognized that I would soon die; therefore, I said to my son Enos: Take these plates. I shared with him the commands of my brother Nephi, and he agreed to obey these commands. I finish my writing on these plates, which has been brief, and I wish the reader farewell, hoping many of my brothers will read my words. Farewell, my brethren.
