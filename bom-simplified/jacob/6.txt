The Lord will bring back Israel in the last days—The world will be destroyed by fire—People must follow Christ to escape the lake of fire and sulfur. About 544–421 B.C.
And now, listen, my brothers, as I mentioned that I would share a prophecy, here it is: that the things spoken by the prophet Zenos about the house of Israel, which he compared to a cultivated olive tree, will definitely happen.
And the day when He will raise His hand again for the second time to save His people will be the very last time that the Lord’s servants will go out with His power to care for and prune His vineyard; and after that, the end will come quickly.
How fortunate are those who have worked hard in His vineyard; how unfortunate are those who will be cast out into their own place! And the world will be consumed by fire.
How loving is our God towards us; He remembers the house of Israel, both roots and branches; He extends His hands to them all day long; yet, they are stubborn and rebellious; but those who do not harden their hearts will be saved in the kingdom of God.
Therefore, my dear brothers, I urgently ask you to repent and come with sincere hearts, and stick close to God as He does to you. And while His mercy is reaching out to you during the daylight, do not harden your hearts.
Yes, today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts; for why would you choose to die?
For look, after you have been nourished by the good word of God throughout the day, will you still produce bad fruit, so that you must be cut down and thrown into the fire?
Look, will you ignore these words? Will you reject the words of the prophets; will you dismiss everything that has been said about Christ, after so many have testified about Him; deny the good message of Christ, the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, suppress the Holy Spirit, and mock the great plan of salvation that has been prepared for you?
Do you not understand that if you choose to do these things, the power of redemption and resurrection found in Christ will lead you to stand in shame and terrible guilt before God’s judgment?
And based on the power of justice, as justice cannot be overlooked, you must be cast into that lake of fire and sulfur, whose flames cannot be put out, and whose smoke rises forever and ever; that lake of fire and sulfur is endless suffering.
Oh then, my dear brothers, repent, and enter through the narrow gate, and stay on the narrow path until you achieve eternal life.
Oh, be wise; what more can I say?
Finally, I say goodbye, until we meet before the righteous judgment of God, which judgment terrifies the wicked with fear and dread. Amen.
