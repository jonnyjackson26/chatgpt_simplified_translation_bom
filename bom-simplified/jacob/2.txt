The message that Jacob, the brother of Nephi, delivered to the people of Nephi after Nephi had passed away:
Now, dear brothers, I, Jacob, feel a deep sense of responsibility to God to fulfill my duties with seriousness, and to cleanse myself of your sins. Today, I have come to the temple to share God's message with you.
You know that I have been committed to my calling, but today I am weighed down with even greater concern and anxiety for your spiritual well-being than ever before.
Look, to this point, you have followed the Lord’s teachings that I have shared with you.
But listen to me; I need you to understand that with the help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth, I can see that you are starting to fall into sin, which is very detestable to me, and even more so to God.
Truly, it pains my soul and fills me with shame before my Creator that I must speak to you about the wickedness in your hearts.
It also saddens me that I must boldly address these issues in front of your wives and children, many of whom are sensitive, pure, and precious in God’s eyes, which pleases Him.
I believe they have come here to hear uplifting words from God, words that heal the broken-hearted.
Therefore, I feel burdened that I must, due to a strict command from God, point out your wrongdoings, which may further wound those already hurt, and for those who are not hurt, instead of enjoying the comforting words of God, they have their souls pierced and minds troubled.
Despite how difficult this is, I must follow God’s commands and speak about your sins and evils in front of the pure-hearted and broken-hearted, under the watchful eye of Almighty God.
Thus, I will speak the truth plainly as dictated by God. For when I asked the Lord, He instructed me to go to the temple tomorrow and declare the message He would give me to this people.
Now, listen carefully, my brothers, as I share this with you: many of you have begun to pursue gold, silver, and various precious metals, which this land—blessed to you and your descendants—has in abundance.
God has favored you greatly, allowing you to gain many riches. Yet, some of you possess more than others and have become prideful, looking down on your brothers because of your expensive clothing and mistreating them, thinking you are superior.
Now, do you think God approves of this behavior? I tell you, He does not. Instead, He condemns you, and if you continue down this path, His judgments will soon come upon you.
Oh, how I wish He would show you how He can strike you down with just a glance!
Oh, I wish He would free you from this wickedness and evil. Oh, if only you would heed His commands and let the pride within you not ruin your souls!
Think of your brothers as equals, and share your wealth freely, so that they may also prosper.
But before you chase after riches, seek the kingdom of God first.
And once you place your hope in Christ, you will gain wealth if you seek it with the intent to do good—such as clothing the needy, feeding the hungry, freeing the captive, and helping the sick and troubled.
Now, my brothers, I’ve spoken to you about pride; what do you have to say about your actions if you have harmed and persecuted your neighbor out of pride for what God has granted you?
Do you not think such behavior is detestable to the Creator of all? Everyone is equally precious in His view. All people come from dust, and He created them for the same purpose: to follow His commands and glorify Him forever.
Now, I will conclude my thoughts on pride. If it weren’t for the need to address a more serious issue, my heart would be filled with joy for you.
However, God’s message weighs heavily on me because of your more serious sins. For the Lord has said: This people has begun to grow more wicked; they do not understand the scriptures, as they try to justify their immoral actions by referencing the lives of David and Solomon.
Indeed, David and Solomon had many wives and concubines, which the Lord found detestable.
Therefore, the Lord has led you out of the land of Jerusalem by His power, so I could raise up a righteous branch from the descendants of Joseph.
Thus, I, the Lord God, will not allow this people to emulate those of old.
So, my brothers, hear me and pay attention to the Lord’s words: No man among you should have more than one wife—no concubines shall he possess;
For I, the Lord God, take pleasure in the purity of women. Immorality is abominable to me, declares the Lord of Hosts.
Therefore, this people must follow my commandments, says the Lord of Hosts, or the land will suffer because of them.
For if I choose, says the Lord of Hosts, to raise a righteous generation, I will command my people; otherwise, they will ignore these commands.
I have witnessed the pain and heard the cries of the daughters of my people in Jerusalem and all the lands because of the wicked actions of their husbands.
And I will not allow the cries of the virtuous daughters whom I have brought from Jerusalem to rise up against the men of my people, says the Lord of Hosts.
They shall not take captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, unless I send upon them a severe curse leading to their destruction; they shall not commit immorality like those of old, says the Lord of Hosts.
Now, my brothers, you know these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; therefore, you have long known them. You have brought great condemnation upon yourselves for doing what you should not have.
You have committed greater sins than the Lamanites, our brothers. You have broken the hearts of your gentle wives and lost your children’s trust due to your poor example; the grief of their hearts ascends to God against you. Because of the strictness of God’s word against you, many hearts have been broken, pierced by deep wounds.
