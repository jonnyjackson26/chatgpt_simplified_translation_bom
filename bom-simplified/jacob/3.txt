I want to address those of you who are pure in heart. Focus your thoughts on God with determination, and pray to Him with great faith. He will comfort you during your struggles, advocate for you, and bring justice upon those who want to harm you.
All of you who are pure in heart, lift your heads and embrace the encouraging word of God; enjoy His love, for if you stay strong in your minds, you can experience this forever.
But woe to you who are not pure in heart and who are filthy in God’s eyes today; unless you repent, the land will suffer for your actions. The Lamanites, who are not as corrupt as you, are also cursed, yet they will be the ones who will drive you to destruction.
The time is coming quickly when, unless you change your ways, they will inherit the land that belongs to you, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous from among you.
Look, the Lamanites, your brothers whom you disdain because of their perceived impurities and the curses upon them, are actually more righteous than you. They have not forgotten the commandment from the Lord given to our forefather—that they should have only one wife, should not have concubines, and should not engage in sexual immorality.
And they faithfully follow this commandment; therefore, because they are obedient, the Lord God will not destroy them but will show them mercy, and one day they will be a blessed people.
See how their husbands cherish their wives, and their wives love their husbands; they care for their children. Their disbelief and animosity towards you come from the wrongdoings of their ancestors. So how can you think you are better than they are in the eyes of your great Creator?
Oh, my friends, I worry that unless you repent of your sins, their skin may appear whiter than yours when you stand with them before God’s throne.
So, I give you this commandment, which is God’s word: do not speak against them because of the darkness of their skin, nor despise them for their perceived evil; instead, remember your own wrongdoings and recognize that their situation is a result of their ancestors' actions.
Therefore, remember your children and how much you have hurt them by your example. Also, recognize that your own impurities may lead them to ruin, and their sins will fall upon you when the final day comes.
Oh, my friends, listen to my words; wake up your spirits; shake off the slumber of spiritual death, and free yourselves from the agony of hell so that you do not become instruments for the devil, destined for that lake of fire and sulfur, which signifies the second death.
Now, I, Jacob, shared many more teachings with the Nephites, urging them to avoid fornication, immorality, and all forms of sin, detailing the terrible consequences of such actions.
There are countless events involving this ever-growing group of people that cannot be recorded on these plates; however, many of their actions are documented on larger plates, including their wars, disputes, and the reigns of their kings.
These plates are known as the plates of Jacob, created by Nephi’s hand. And I conclude my speaking with these words.
