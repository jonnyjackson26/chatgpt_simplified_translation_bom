The commandments of Alma to his son Shiblon.
Comprising chapter 38.
My son, listen carefully to what I say, just like I told Helaman. If you follow God's commandments, you will thrive in the land; but if you do not obey, you will be separated from His presence.
Now, my son, I hope to find great happiness in you because of your steadfastness and loyalty to God; since you have started to seek the Lord since your youth, I hope you keep following His commandments, for those who endure to the end are blessed.
I want you to know, my son, I have already found great joy in you because of your faithfulness, hard work, patience, and endurance among the Zoramite people.
I know you were imprisoned; yes, I know you were stoned for your beliefs, and you faced all those challenges with patience because the Lord was with you. Now you know that the Lord did rescue you.
Now, my son Shiblon, remember that if you trust in God, He will deliver you from your trials, troubles, and afflictions, and you will be raised up at the last day.
I don’t want you to think I know these things on my own; it’s the Spirit of God within me that reveals them. If I hadn’t been born of God, I wouldn’t understand these truths.
But look, the Lord, in His great mercy, sent an angel to tell me that I had to stop the destructive work among His people; yes, I saw an angel face to face, and he spoke to me with a voice like thunder that shook the earth.
I experienced three days and three nights of intense pain and suffering; and until I cried out to the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, I didn’t find forgiveness for my sins. But when I called to Him, I found peace for my soul.
Now, my son, I’ve shared this with you so you can gain wisdom. Learn from me that there is no other way for man to be saved, except through Christ. He is the life and light of the world. He embodies truth and righteousness.
Now that you’ve started teaching the word, I want you to keep teaching; be devoted and disciplined in all things.
Make sure you don’t become proud; don’t boast about your wisdom or strength.
Be bold, but don’t be overbearing. Also, control your passions, so you can be filled with love; avoid being idle.
Don’t pray like the Zoramites do, trying to be seen by others or gain praise for your wisdom.
Instead of saying: "O God, thank you that we are better than others," say: "O Lord, forgive me for my unworthiness, and remember my brothers with mercy"—always acknowledge your shortcomings before God.
May the Lord bless your soul and welcome you into His kingdom at the last day, where you can find peace. Now go, my son, and share this message with the people. Stay serious. Farewell, my son.
