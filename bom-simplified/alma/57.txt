I received a letter from King Ammoron saying that if I handed over the prisoners of war we had captured, he would give us the city of Antiparah.
I wrote back to the king, insisting that we were confident in our ability to take Antiparah with our own strength, and that giving up the prisoners for the city seemed foolish to us. We would only give up our prisoners in exchange.
Ammoron rejected my letter because he did not want to exchange prisoners. So, we started getting ready to attack the city of Antiparah.
The people of Antiparah abandoned the city and fled to their other fortified cities, which allowed us to take control of Antiparah.
Thus, the twenty-eighth year of the judges’ reign came to an end.
At the beginning of the twenty-ninth year, we received a shipment of food and reinforcements from Zarahemla and the surrounding areas, adding about six thousand men to our ranks, in addition to sixty sons of the Ammonites who joined my band of two thousand. We were now strong and had plenty of supplies.
We decided to engage in battle with the army protecting the city of Cumeni.
I want to show you that we quickly got what we wanted; with part of our strong force, we surrounded the city of Cumeni at night just before they were to receive their food supply.
We camped around the city for many nights, sleeping with our swords ready and keeping watch, so the Lamanites could not attack us at night, which they tried to do many times, but each time they attempted it, they were met with death.
Eventually, their supplies did arrive, and they intended to enter the city at night. Instead of being the Lamanites, we were the Nephites; so we seized both the supplies and the Lamanites.
Even though the Lamanites were cut off from their supplies like this, they still intended to hold the city. Therefore, it made sense for us to take the provisions and send them to Judea, while our prisoners would go to Zarahemla.
Shortly thereafter, the Lamanites began to lose all hope of help and eventually surrendered the city to us; thus, we achieved our goal of obtaining the city of Cumeni.
However, the number of prisoners we had was so large that we had to use all our strength to contain them or kill them.
You see, they tried to break free in large numbers, attacking us with stones, clubs, or anything they could grab, leading to over two thousand of them being killed after they surrendered.
So, we had to decide whether to end their lives or keep them under close guard all the way to Zarahemla. Additionally, our supplies were only enough for our own men, despite what we took from the Lamanites.
In such critical circumstances, it was difficult to decide what to do with these prisoners; nevertheless, we resolved to send them to Zarahemla. We chose some of our men to take charge of them on the way there.
But the next day, they returned instead. We didn't ask about the prisoners because the Lamanites were attacking us, and they arrived just in time to save us from being overrun. Ammoron had sent additional provisions and a large army to support them.
Those men we sent with the prisoners arrived just in time to stop the Lamanites, who were about to defeat us.
My small group of two thousand and sixty fought with incredible determination; they stood strong against the Lamanites and dealt death to all who challenged them.
While the rest of our army was starting to give in to the Lamanites, those two thousand and sixty remained resolute and fearless.
They obeyed every order perfectly; their faith led them to succeed because I remembered what their mothers had taught them.
It was this group of my sons, along with the men chosen to escort the prisoners, who made this great victory possible; they drove the Lamanites back to the city of Manti.
We managed to keep the city of Cumeni and were not entirely wiped out; still, we suffered significant losses.
After the Lamanites fled, I quickly ordered that my wounded men be pulled from among the dead, and I made sure their wounds were treated.
Out of my two thousand and sixty men, two hundred had fainted from blood loss; however, thanks to God's goodness and to our astonishment and joy, not one of them died. None of them perished, and all had multiple wounds.
Their survival amazed our entire army, especially since a thousand of our fellow soldiers had been killed. We attribute this miracle to God's power, due to their great faith in what they believed—that there is a just God who preserves those who do not doubt.
This was the faith of those I've mentioned; they were young, strong-minded, and continually trusted in God.
After ensuring our wounded men were cared for and burying our dead along with the many dead Lamanites, we asked Gid about the prisoners that were supposed to go to Zarahemla.
Gid was the lead captain responsible for guarding them on their way.
These are the words Gid shared with me: We started to go down to Zarahemla with our prisoners when we encountered some of our army's spies who were watching the Lamanite camp.
They warned us that the Lamanite armies were marching toward Cumeni and were planning to attack our people.
When our prisoners heard this, it gave them courage, and they rebelled against us.
Because of their rebellion, we had to defend ourselves. They charged at us, most of them running onto our swords, resulting in many of them being killed, while the few who survived broke free and escaped.
When they fled and we couldn't catch up, we hurried back to the city of Cumeni to assist our comrades in defending it.
Once more, we were saved from our enemies. Blessed be the name of God; for it is He who has delivered us and accomplished this great thing for us.
When I, Helaman, heard Gid's words, I was overwhelmed with joy because of God's goodness in keeping us safe from destruction; I trust that the souls of those who died have found peace with their God.
