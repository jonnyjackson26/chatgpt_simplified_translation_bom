The message that Alma, the High Priest following God's holy order, shared with the people in their towns and villages across the land.
To attain salvation, people must turn away from their sins and follow God’s commandments, experience a spiritual rebirth, purify themselves through the sacrifice of Christ, be humble, set aside pride and jealousy, and perform good deeds—The Good Shepherd calls His followers—Those who do wicked things belong to the devil—Alma testifies about the truth he teaches and urges people to repent—The names of the righteous will be included in the book of life.
So Alma started to share God's message with the people, starting in the land of Zarahemla and then throughout the entire region.
Here are the words he spoke to the church in Zarahemla, as recorded by himself:
I, Alma, was appointed by my father, Alma, to be a high priest of God’s church, having received divine authority to do this. I tell you that he started a church in the area of Nephi, specifically in the land known as Mormon, and he baptized his friends in the waters of Mormon.
God, in His mercy and power, saved them from king Noah's people.
Then they were made captive by the Lamanites while in the wilderness; I tell you they were imprisoned, but the Lord freed them again through His word, and we settled in this land, where we began to spread God’s church.
Now I ask you, my friends in this church, do you remember your ancestors' captivity? Yes, and do you recall God's mercy and patience towards them? Moreover, do you remember how He saved their souls from hell?
He changed their hearts; He awakened them from a deep slumber, and they turned to God. They were lost in darkness, yet their souls were brightened by the eternal gospel; they were surrounded by death and hell, facing certain destruction.
And now I ask you, my friends, were they destroyed? I say to you, No, they were not.
Again I ask, were the bonds of death broken, and were the chains of hell that surrounded them removed? Yes, they were freed, their spirits soared, and they sang of redeeming love. I tell you that they are saved.
Now I ask you, under what conditions were they saved? What hope did they have for salvation? What caused them to be freed from death and hell?
Listen, I can tell you—didn’t my father Alma believe the words spoken by prophet Abinadi? And wasn’t he a true prophet of God? Did he not speak God’s words, and did my father not believe them?
Because of his faith, a profound change took place in his heart. I assure you that this is true.
He preached to your ancestors, and they also experienced a great change in their hearts; they humbled themselves and trusted the true and living God. They remained faithful until the end, so they were saved.
Now I ask you, my church family, have you been spiritually reborn? Do you reflect God's image in your face? Have you felt this powerful change in your hearts?
Do you have faith in the Savior who created you? Do you look forward with hope, envisioning your mortal body raised to immortality, and this corruption transformed into incorruption, to stand before God and be judged for your actions in this life?
I ask you, can you imagine hearing the Lord’s voice on that day, saying: Come to me, you blessed ones, for your deeds have been righteous on the earth?
Or do you think you can lie to the Lord then, saying, “Lord, our actions have been good on the earth,” and He will save you?
Can you picture yourselves standing before God, troubled and regretful, fully aware of your sins, remembering all your wrongdoings, and realizing you've defied God's commandments?
Can you look up to God that day with a pure heart and clean hands? Can you look up, having God’s image reflected in your face?
Can you truly think you'll be saved after submitting yourselves to the devil?
You will know then that you cannot be saved; no one can be saved unless their garments are made white, purified from all sins, through the blood of Him who was prophesied to come and redeem His people from their sins.
Now I ask you, my friends, how will any of you feel if you stand before God stained with blood and filth? What will these sins reveal about you?
Won’t they confirm that you are murderers, guilty of all kinds of wickedness?
Do you believe someone like that can sit in God’s kingdom alongside Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the holy prophets, whose garments are clean and pure?
I tell you, No; unless you make God a liar from the beginning, or think He is lying, you cannot believe such a person can belong in heaven. Instead, they will be cast out; they are children of the devil’s kingdom.
Now I say to you, my friends, if you have experienced a change of heart and if you feel the joy of redeeming love, can you still feel that way now?
Have you lived your lives blameless before God? Could you say, if you were to die today, that you were humble enough? That your garments have been purified through the blood of Christ, who comes to redeem His people from their sins?
Are you free from pride? I tell you, if you are not, then you are not prepared to meet God. You need to prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is drawing near, and such a person does not have eternal life.
Are you among those who are not free from envy? I tell you, you are not ready; and I hope you prepare quickly, for the time is close, and you don’t know when it will come; such a one cannot be found guiltless.
Again, is there anyone who mocks his brother or persecutes him?
Woe to that person, for he is not prepared, and the time is come that he must repent or he cannot be saved!
Woe also to all you who do evil; repent, repent, for the Lord God has declared it!
Look, He offers an invitation to everyone, for His mercy reaches out to them, saying: Repent, and I will accept you.
Yes, He says: Come to me, and you will partake of the tree of life; you will freely eat and drink of the bread and waters of life;
Yes, come to me and do good works, and you will not be destroyed and cast into the fire—
For look, the time is near that anyone who does not produce good fruit, or who does not perform righteous deeds, has cause to weep and mourn.
O you who do evil; you who are caught up in the empty things of this world; you who claim to know righteousness yet wander off, like sheep without a shepherd, even though a shepherd has called for you and continues to call for you, but you refuse to listen to His voice!
I tell you, the good shepherd is calling you; indeed, he calls you by His name, which is Christ; if you refuse to listen to the good shepherd's voice, the name by which you are called, you are not His sheep.
And now if you are not the sheep of the good shepherd, whose flock are you? I tell you that the devil is your shepherd, and you are part of his fold; who can deny this? I say to you, whoever denies this is a liar and a child of the devil.
For I tell you that all that is good comes from God, and all evil comes from the devil.
Therefore, if someone produces good works, he listens to the good shepherd's voice and follows Him; but whoever produces evil works becomes a child of the devil, as he listens to his voice and follows him.
Whoever does this must receive his reward; thus, for his reward, he receives death concerning righteousness because he is dead to all good deeds.
Now, my friends, I want you to listen to me because I speak with all my heart; indeed, I have spoken clearly so you cannot err or have spoken according to God's commandments.
I am called to speak like this, under God's holy order, which is in Christ Jesus; yes, I am commanded to stand and testify to this people about what our ancestors have said regarding what is to come.
This is not all. Do you think I don’t know these things myself? I tell you that I do know, and I know they are true. How do you think I know for sure?
I tell you they are revealed to me through the Holy Spirit of God. I have fasted and prayed for many days to know these things for myself. And now I know for myself that they are true; for the Lord God has shown them to me through His Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation that is with me.
Additionally, I tell you that it has been revealed to me that what our fathers spoke is true, likewise according to the spirit of prophecy within me, which is also by the revelation of God’s Spirit.
I assure you that I know for myself that whatever I tell you about what’s to come is true; and I tell you, I know that Jesus Christ will come, yes, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, mercy, and truth. And it is He who will take away the sins of the world, yes, the sins of every man who faithfully believes in His name.
And now I say to you that this is the duty assigned to me, yes, to preach to my beloved brothers and sisters, and to everyone living in the land; yes, to preach to all, old and young, both free and enslaved; yes, I say to you, the elderly, the middle-aged, and the young people; yes, to urge them to repent and be spiritually reborn.
Yes, thus says the Spirit: Repent, all you ends of the earth, for the kingdom of heaven is near; yes, the Son of God is coming in His glory, might, majesty, strength, and dominion. Yes, my dear friends, I tell you that the Spirit says: Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; soon the King of heaven will shine forth among all humanity.
And the Spirit also tells me, yes, cries out to me with a mighty voice, saying: Go forth and tell these people—Repent, for unless you repent, you have no chance to inherit the kingdom of heaven.
Again, I tell you, the Spirit says: Behold, the axe is laid at the base of the tree; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire, a fire that cannot be quenched. Remember, the Holy One has declared it.
Now, my beloved friends, I ask you, can you withstand these words; can you ignore these messages and trampling on the Holy One? Will you continue in pride, thinking highly of yourselves? Will you persist in wearing fancy clothes and focusing on material things in this world?
Will you keep pretending you are better than others? Will you continue to persecute your brothers and sisters who humbly follow God’s will, those who have been brought into this church by the Holy Spirit, and who do good works fitting for repentance—
And will you keep turning your back on the poor and needy, withholding help from them?
Finally, all you who continue in your wickedness, I tell you that these are the ones who will be cut down and cast into the fire unless they quickly repent.
Now I tell you, all of you who desire to follow the good shepherd's voice, separate yourselves from the wicked and do not touch their unclean things; their names will be erased, ensuring the wicked do not mix with the righteous, fulfilling God’s word, which says: The names of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;
For the names of the righteous will be written in the book of life, and to them, I will grant a place at my right hand. Now, my friends, what do you say against this? I tell you, if you speak against it, it doesn’t matter because God's word must be fulfilled.
For what shepherd among you, with many sheep, does not watch over them to prevent wolves from entering and devouring his flock? If a wolf enters, does he not drive it out? Yes, and if possible, he will destroy it.
Now I tell you that the good shepherd is calling you; if you heed His voice, He will bring you into His fold, and you will be His sheep; He commands you to allow no harmful wolves among you so that you will not be destroyed.
And now I, Alma, command you in the words of the one who has commanded me to follow the teachings I’ve given you.
I speak with authority to those of you in the church; for those who are not part of the church, I invite you: Come and be baptized in repentance so you can also partake of the tree of life.
