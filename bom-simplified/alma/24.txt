The Amalekites, Amulonites, and Lamanites living in various regions, including Amulon, Helam, and Jerusalem, who had not converted and did not follow the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were incited to anger by the Amalekites and Amulonites against their own people.
Their anger against their brethren grew very intense, leading them to rebel against their king, insisting he could no longer rule them; as a result, they armed themselves against the Anti-Nephi-Lehis.
The king passed down the throne to his son, naming him Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
The king died in the same year the Lamanites began preparing to attack the people of God.
When Ammon, his brothers, and their companions saw the Lamanites getting ready to destroy their brethren, they traveled to the land of Midian, where Ammon met up with all his brothers; from there, they went to the land of Ishmael to discuss with Lamoni and his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi how to defend themselves against the Lamanites.
However, none of the people who had turned to the Lord were willing to take up arms against their brethren; in fact, they wouldn't even prepare for war, and their king told them not to.
He then addressed the people about the situation, expressing gratitude to God for sending their brethren, the Nephites, to teach them and show them the error of their forefathers' ways.
He thanked God for giving them a part of His Spirit to soften their hearts, allowing them to connect with the Nephites.
He also expressed gratitude for the understanding they gained through this connection, realizing their sins and the many wrongful acts they had committed.
He continued, thanking God that they had the opportunity to repent and that He had forgiven their numerous sins and crimes, removing their guilt through the grace of His Son.
Now, dear brethren, since all we could do was repent for our terrible sins and seek God's forgiveness, it was an immense task to truly turn our hearts back to Him.
Since God has cleansed us and our swords are no longer stained, let us not further tarnish them with the blood of our brethren.
Instead, I say we should keep our swords unstained; for if we stain them again, they cannot be made bright again by the blood of Jesus, which brings us atonement.
God has shown us mercy and revealed these truths for our salvation; He wants us and our children to know about His plan, so He sends His angels to guide us.
O how merciful God is! Now that our stains are removed and our swords shine, let us store them away to keep them bright as evidence before Him on Judgment Day, showing we have not shed our brethren's blood since receiving His word and being made clean.
If our brethren come to destroy us, we will bury our swords deep in the earth, keeping them bright as proof that we have never used them; if they destroy us, we shall go to our God and be saved.
Once the king finished speaking, all the people gathered together, took their swords and any weapons meant for killing, and buried them deep in the ground.
They did this as a testimony to God and to others, vowing never to use weapons again to kill; they would rather give their lives than harm their brethren, and instead of remaining idle, they would work hard with their hands.
From this, we see that when the Lamanites turned to the truth, they were steadfast and willing to die rather than sin; thus, they buried their weapons of war to maintain peace.
Meanwhile, the Lamanites prepared for war and marched to Nephi to kill the king, replace him, and exterminate the Anti-Nephi-Lehi people.
When the people noticed the Lamanites approaching, they went out to meet them, humbling themselves and calling upon God; they were in this position when the Lamanites attacked, striking them down with swords.
Without facing any resistance, they killed a thousand and five of them; we know these slain are blessed, as they have returned to dwell with God.
Seeing that their brethren would not flee, nor turn away, but lay down and die while praising God, the Lamanites were moved to spare them.
Many Lamanites felt sorrow for their brethren who fell and regretted their actions.
They discarded their weapons of war, refusing to take them up again due to their remorse for the killings they committed, and they came down as their brethren did, relying on the mercy of those whose hands were raised to kill them.
On that day, the people of God were joined by more than the number who had been slain, who were righteous and therefore surely saved.
Not one wicked person was killed among them; over a thousand emerged into the knowledge of the truth, showing how the Lord can work in various ways for the salvation of His people.
The vast majority of those Lamanites killing their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, mostly aligned with the order of Nehor.
Among those who joined Godâ€™s people, there were none from the Amalekites, Amulonites, or the order of Nehor; they were the actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.
Thus, we can clearly see that once a people have been enlightened by the Spirit of God and gained significant understanding of righteousness, if they fall away into sin, they can become even more hardened, making their state worse than if they had never known the truth at all.
