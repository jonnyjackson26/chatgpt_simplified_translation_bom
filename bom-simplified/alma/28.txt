After the people of Ammon settled in the land of Jershon, and a church was also formed there, the Nephite armies surrounded the land of Jershon, as well as the borders around Zarahemla; however, the Lamanite armies followed their brothers into the wilderness.
As a result, a huge battle took place; it was unprecedented among all the people in the land since Lehi left Jerusalem, and tens of thousands of Lamanites were killed and scattered.
There was also a significant loss of life among the Nephites; however, the Lamanites were pushed back and dispersed, allowing the Nephites to return to their land.
During this time, there was widespread mourning and sorrow felt throughout the entire land among the Nephite people—
The cries of widows grieving for their husbands, fathers lamenting their sons, daughters mourning for their brothers, and brothers weeping for their fathers; thus the sounds of mourning echoed throughout, as they grieved for their slain family members.
Certainly, this was a sorrowful day; a time of solemnity and much fasting and prayer.
Thus concludes the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges over the Nephite people;
This is the account of Ammon and his brothers, detailing their journeys in the land of Nephi, their struggles and suffering, their sorrows and trials, and their unimaginable joy, along with the safety and welcome of their brothers in the land of Jershon. May the Lord, the Redeemer of all, bless their souls forever.
This narrates the wars and disputes among the Nephites, and also the battles between the Nephites and Lamanites; and now the fifteenth year of the judges' reign has come to an end.
From the first year to the fifteenth, many thousands of lives have been lost; it has resulted in a terribly bloody scene.
The bodies of many thousands lie in the ground, while the bodies of many others decay in piles on the surface of the earth; many thousands are grieving for their loved ones, fearing, thanks to the promises of the Lord, that those lost are condemned to eternal misery.
While many thousands grieve for their family members, they also rejoice and find hope, knowing, according to the Lord's promises, that their loved ones are raised to dwell at God’s side, in a state of endless happiness.
Thus, we observe how great the disparity among people is due to sin and wrongdoing, and the power of the devil, who uses devious schemes to trap men's hearts.
This illustrates the urgent call for people to work in the Lord's vineyards; we see reasons for both sorrow and joy—sorrow because of death and devastation among humanity, and joy because of the light of Christ that brings life.
