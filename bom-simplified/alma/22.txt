As Ammon continued to teach the people of Lamoni, let's switch back to Aaron and his brothers. After leaving the land of Middoni, Aaron was guided by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, specifically to the king's house, who ruled over all the land except for the land of Ishmael; this king was Lamoni's father.
When Aaron entered the king's palace with his brothers, he bowed and addressed the king, saying: "King, we are the brothers of Ammon, whom you set free from prison."
Aaron continued: "If you will spare our lives, we will serve you." The king replied: "Get up; I will let you live, and I will not make you my servants. Instead, I want you to serve me, because your brother Ammon's generous words have troubled my mind. I want to know why he hasn’t come back from Middoni with you."
Aaron explained to the king: "The Spirit of the Lord has sent him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael to teach the people of Lamoni."
Then the king asked: "What do you mean by the Spirit of the Lord? This troubles me deeply."
He also asked: "What did Ammon mean when he said that if we repent, we will be saved, but if not, we will be lost on the last day?"
Aaron responded: "Do you believe that there is a God?" The king replied, "I know the Amalekites talk about a God, and I allowed them to build places to worship him. If you say there is a God, then I will believe."
When Aaron heard this, he was filled with joy and said: "As surely as you live, O king, there is a God."
The king then asked: "Is God that Great Spirit who brought our ancestors out of Jerusalem?"
Aaron confirmed: "Yes, he is that Great Spirit, and he created everything in heaven and on earth. Do you believe this?"
The king replied: "Yes, I believe the Great Spirit created all things. Please tell me more, and I will believe your words."
Seeing the king's willingness to believe, Aaron began telling him the creation story, explaining how God made man in His own image, gave him commandments, and how man fell due to disobedience.
Aaron taught the king from the creation of Adam, explaining the fall of mankind, their sinful state, and God’s plan of redemption through Christ, established before the world began, for everyone who believes in Him.
He emphasized that since man had fallen, we cannot earn anything on our own; it is through Christ’s suffering and death that our sins can be forgiven through faith and repentance, and that He conquers death, ensuring that the grave cannot defeat us. Aaron shared all these truths with the king.
After hearing this, the king asked: "What must I do to have this eternal life you speak of? How can I be born of God, rid myself of this wicked spirit, and receive His Spirit so that I may be filled with joy and not be rejected on the last day? I’ll give up everything I have, even my kingdom, to know this joy."
Aaron replied: "If you truly desire this, you must kneel before God, repent of all your sins, and call on His name in faith, believing that you will receive. Then you will find the hope you seek."
After Aaron spoke these words, the king knelt before the Lord, even lying flat on the ground, crying out in desperation:
"O God, Aaron has told me there is a God; if you are God, please reveal yourself to me. I will give up all my sins to know you, so that I may be raised from the dead and saved in the end." After saying this, the king fell to the ground as if he were dead.
His servants hurried to tell the queen what had happened to the king. When she entered and saw him lying there as if dead, and Aaron and his brothers standing nearby, she became angry with them and ordered her servants to kill them.
However, the servants recognized the cause of the king's condition and were afraid to harm Aaron and his brothers. They pleaded with the queen, saying: "Why do you want to kill these men when one of them is more powerful than us? We would be overpowered by them."
Seeing her servants’ fear, the queen also became very worried that some harm might come to her. She instructed her servants to gather the people so they could kill Aaron and his brothers.
Fearing that a crowd might cause a disturbance, Aaron, aware of the people's hard hearts, took action. He lifted the king from the ground and said: "Stand." The king arose, renewed in strength.
This miracle was witnessed by the queen and many servants, and when they saw it, they were astonished and filled with fear. The king then began to serve and minister to them, and as a result, all his household came to believe in the Lord.
A crowd gathered due to the queen's orders, and murmurs began against Aaron and his brethren.
But the king stepped forward and preached to the people, calming their anger towards Aaron and his companions.
Seeing that the crowd was settled, the king ordered Aaron and his brothers to stand in front of everyone and share their message.
The king then sent a proclamation throughout his entire land, to all his people across all regions, including those by the sea on the east and west, and the narrow wilderness strip separating the land of Zarahemla.
Most of the idle Lamanites lived in the wilderness and were nomadic; they scattered across the wilderness in the land of Nephi and around the borders of the seashore, where their ancestors first settled.
Many Lamanites also lived on the east by the sea, which the Nephites had pushed them to. Thus, the Nephites found themselves nearly surrounded by Lamanites; however, they occupied all the northern areas of the land bordering the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west.
This northern territory was called Desolation, extending into a land that had once been inhabited and destroyed, discovered by the people of Zarahemla, marking the spot of their initial landing.
They moved further into the southern wilderness. Consequently, the land to the north was termed Desolation, while the southern land was referred to as Bountiful, which contained various wild animals, some having migrated from the land to the north.
For the Nephites, the distance from Bountiful to the land of Desolation was a day and a half’s journey, and the lands of Nephi and Zarahemla were almost entirely encircled by water, with only a small neck of land connecting the north and the south.
The Nephites occupied the land of Bountiful from the east to the west sea. They, in their wisdom, with their soldiers and defenses, restricted the Lamanites to the south, preventing them from expanding into the northern territories.
As a result, the Lamanites were confined to the land of Nephi and the surrounding wilderness. This strategy was wise for the Nephites, who saw the Lamanites as adversaries, ensuring that their own territory remained secure.
And now, having shared this, I will return to the account of Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and their companions.
