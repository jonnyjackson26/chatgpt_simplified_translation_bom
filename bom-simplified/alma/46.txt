People who refused to listen to Helaman and his companions gathered together against their fellow believers.
They were extremely angry and determined to kill them.
Their leader, a strong and big man, was named Amalickiah.
Amalickiah wanted to be king, and the angry group wanted him as their leader. Most of them were lower judges in the land, and they sought power.
They were influenced by Amalickiah’s flattering words, believing that if they supported him, he would make them rulers over the people.
Despite Helaman and his companions' teachings and their care for the church, Amalickiah led them to conflict and division.
Many in the church were swayed by his flattering speeches, causing them to break away from the church, which put the Nephite people in a very dangerous position, despite their recent victory over the Lamanites and their joyful celebrations of being delivered by God.
This shows how quickly people forget the Lord, how easily they do wrong, and how easily they are led astray by the devil.
One wicked individual can cause great harm among people.
Amalickiah was clever and skilled at flattery, leading many people to commit wrongdoing and threatening to destroy the church of God and the liberty He had given them in the land.
When Moroni, the chief commander of the Nephite armies, learned about the conflicts, he was furious with Amalickiah.
He tore his coat, took a piece of it, and wrote on it—In remembrance of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and attached it to a pole.
He put on his helmet, armor, and shields, strapped on his weapons, and lifted the pole with the torn coat (calling it the title of liberty). He humbly prayed to God for blessings of freedom for his people, as long as there were faithful Christians in the land.
Those who were true followers of Christ were called Christians by those outside the church.
The faithful in the church willingly took the name of Christ as Christians because they believed in the coming of Christ.
At that time, Moroni prayed for the cause of the Christians and for the freedom of the land to be blessed.
After pouring out his heart to God, he named all the land south of Desolation, and all the land north and south, as a chosen land, a land of liberty.
He boldly declared that God would not allow those who are despised for following Christ to be crushed and destroyed unless they brought it upon themselves through their own sins.
After saying this, Moroni went among the people, holding up the torn piece of his garment so everyone could see the writing and shouted loudly:
"Whoever will stand for this title in the land, come forward with the strength of the Lord and make a promise to uphold their rights and their religion, so that God may bless them."
When Moroni proclaimed these words, the people rushed together, ready for battle, tearing their garments as a sign of their commitment to God, promising that if they ever disobeyed God's commandments and were ashamed to take the name of Christ, they would suffer just as they had ripped their clothes.
This was their promise: they threw their garments at Moroni's feet, pledging that they deserved to be destroyed like their brethren in the north if they fell into sin; just as they had cast their garments before him to be stepped on.
Moroni told them: "We are a remnant of Jacob's descendants, a remnant of Joseph, whose coat his brothers tore to pieces. Let’s remember to obey God's commandments, or we might be torn apart by our own people and suffer imprisonment, enslavement, or death."
"Let’s safeguard our freedom as a remnant of Joseph; let’s recall Jacob's words before he died. He saw that part of Joseph’s coat was preserved and had not decayed. He said—'Just as this part of my son’s coat has been saved, so shall a remnant of my son’s descendants be saved by God's hand while the rest of Joseph's descendants perish, just like the remnant of his coat.'"
"Now, this brings me sorrow; yet, I have joy in my son because of the part of his descendants that will be taken to God."
This was Jacob’s message.
Now, who knows if the descendants of Joseph who shall perish like his coat are those who have turned away from us? And it could be us if we do not hold strong in our faith in Christ.
After Moroni said these words, he went out and sent messengers throughout the land to gather everyone who wanted to defend their freedom against Amalickiah and his supporters, called Amalickiahites.
When Amalickiah realized that Moroni's followers outnumbered his own, and that his group was uncertain about the righteousness of their cause, he feared losing and fled with some of his men to the land of Nephi.
Moroni believed it was unwise to let the Lamanites gain any more power, so he planned to confront Amalickiah and eliminate him, knowing he would incite the Lamanites against them to achieve his goals.
Therefore, Moroni took his assembled and armed forces, who had agreed to keep peace, and marched into the wilderness to cut off Amalickiah's path.
He effectively executed his plan, moving into the wilderness to intercept Amalickiah’s armies.
As a result, Amalickiah fled with a small group of men, while most were captured by Moroni and returned to the land of Zarahemla.
Moroni was appointed by the chief judges and the people, giving him authority over the Nephite armies to establish control.
Anyone among the Amalickiahites who refused to agree to support freedom and maintain a free government was put to death; only a handful rejected the freedom covenant.
Moroni also made sure the title of liberty was raised on every tower across the Nephite lands, symbolizing freedom among the Nephites.
Peace was restored in the land, and they maintained this peace up until nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the judges' reign.
Helaman and the high priests also kept order in the church, enjoying four years of significant peace and joy within it.
Many died, fully believing that the Lord Jesus Christ had redeemed their souls, leaving the world rejoicing.
Some died from fevers that were common during certain seasons, but not as many because of the many beneficial plants and roots God had prepared to cure ailments caused by the climate.
Others died of old age; those who died in faith of Christ are surely happy in Him, as we can assume.
