After Alma finished speaking to the members of the church in Zarahemla, he appointed priests and leaders by placing his hands on them, following God’s instructions, to lead and oversee the church.
Anyone who did not belong to the church but repented of their sins was baptized as a sign of their change and was welcomed into the church.
However, those who were members of the church but refused to repent of their wrongdoings and did not humble themselves before God—specifically, those who were proud—were cast out, and their names were removed, so they would not be counted among the righteous.
In this way, they began to organize the church in the city of Zarahemla.
I want you to know that the message from God was available to everyone, and no one was excluded from the opportunity to gather and hear God’s word.
Still, God commanded His followers to meet frequently, and to fast and pray earnestly for the well-being of those who did not know Him.
After establishing these guidelines, Alma left the church in Zarahemla and went east across the river Sidon to the valley of Gideon, where a city had been built, named Gideon, after a man who was killed by Nehor.
Alma then went to teach the message of God to the church established in the valley of Gideon, following the truth revealed by his ancestors and the inspiration of prophecy within him, as well as the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who would come to save His people from their sins, and by the divine authority he had received. And this is how it is recorded. Amen.
