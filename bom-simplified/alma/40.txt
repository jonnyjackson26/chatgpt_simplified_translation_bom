Now my son, I want to share a bit more with you because I can see you are worried about what happens after death regarding the resurrection.
Listen carefully, I want to clarify that there is no resurrection, or in simpler terms, this physical body does not turn into an immortal one, and this decaying body does not become incorruptible, until after Christ comes.
Indeed, He is the one who will bring the dead back to life. However, my son, the resurrection is not happening just yet. Now, I’m revealing to you a mystery. Although there are many mysteries that only God knows, I want to explain one that I have diligently asked God about—specifically about the resurrection.
There is an appointed time for everyone to emerge from the dead. No one knows when that time will be, but God knows when it is.
Whether there will be one, two, or multiple times when people rise from the dead doesn’t matter; God knows all of this, and it is enough for me to know that there is a designated time for everyone to be resurrected.
Now, there must be a period between death and resurrection.
And now I want to ask what happens to the souls of people from when they die until the time set for them to rise again?
It doesn't really matter if there will be more than one resurrection time; people do not die all at once, and that doesn’t matter to God—all time is like one day to Him, and we only measure time regarding mankind.
So, there is a specific time when people will rise again from the dead; and there is a gap between death and resurrection. Regarding this time gap, what happens to the souls of people is what I have deeply sought to learn from the Lord, and this is what I do know.
When the time comes for everyone to rise, they will understand that God knows all timings set for man.
Now, talking about the condition of the soul between death and resurrection—an angel shared with me that as soon as people leave their physical bodies, all spirits, whether good or bad, return to God who gave them life.
Then, the spirits of the righteous will enter a state of happiness known as paradise, a place of rest and peace, where they will no longer be troubled or burdened by sorrow.
On the other hand, the spirits of the wicked, those who have chosen to do evil and have no part of God's Spirit, will find themselves cast into outer darkness. They will experience weeping, wailing, and grinding of teeth due to their own wrongdoing, as they are held captive by the devil’s influence.
This is the state of the wicked—lost in darkness, facing fear and expecting God's wrath. They remain in this condition, just as the righteous dwell in paradise, until the time for resurrection comes.
Some believe this state of happiness and misery before resurrection might be considered a first resurrection. Yes, it can be described as a form of resurrection, as it involves the spirit or soul being placed in either happiness or misery according to previous teachings.
Furthermore, there has been talk of a first resurrection, which refers to all those from Adam’s time until Christ’s resurrection.
However, we should not think this first resurrection only means the souls being assigned to happiness or misery. That’s not what it means.
I tell you, it refers to the reunion of the soul with the body from the time of Adam through to Christ’s resurrection.
Now, I can’t say whether the souls and bodies of those mentioned will all be reunited at once, both the wicked and the righteous; what I will say is that they will all rise, or their resurrection will occur before the resurrection of those who die after Christ.
My son, I don’t claim that their resurrection happens at Christ’s resurrection; but I believe that the souls and bodies of the righteous are reunited at His resurrection and ascension into heaven.
But whether that happens at His resurrection or afterward, I can’t specify; what I do say is that there is a period between death and the body’s resurrection, during which the soul is in either happiness or misery until the time appointed by God for the dead to rise and reunite, and stand before Him to be judged for their actions.
Indeed, this brings about the restoration of everything that has been prophesied.
The soul will be restored to the body, and the body will return to the soul; yes, every limb and joint will be restored; even every hair on the head will be restored; everything will return to its proper and perfect state.
Now, my son, this is the restoration that the prophets have spoken about—
And then the righteous will shine brightly in God’s kingdom.
But behold, a terrible fate awaits the wicked; they die in a state of disconnection from goodness; they are impure, and nothing impure can enter God’s kingdom; they will be cast out and will face the consequences of their evil actions, and they will drink from a bitter cup.
