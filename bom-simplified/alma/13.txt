People are chosen as high priests due to their great faith and good actions. They are meant to teach the commandments. Through living righteously, they are purified and find peace with the Lord. Melchizedek was one of those high priests. Angels are spreading joyful news everywhere, announcing the actual arrival of Christ.
Again, my friends, I want you to think about the time when the Lord gave these commandments to His children. Remember, the Lord appointed priests according to His sacred order, which follows the order of His Son, to teach these important truths to the people.
These priests were appointed in a way that helped the people know how to look to His Son for salvation.
This is how they were appointed: chosen and prepared since the beginning of time, according to God's knowledge in advance. They were chosen because of their deep faith and good deeds. Initially, they were free to choose good or evil; since they chose good and showed great faith, they were called with a special calling, prepared with a form of redemption.
Thus, they were called to this sacred role because of their faith, while others rejected the Spirit of God because of their stubborn hearts and unseeing minds. If this had not been the case, they could have enjoyed the same blessings as their peers.
In essence, they started on equal footing with their peers; this sacred calling was prepared from the beginning of time for those who would not harden their hearts, all through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared in this way.
And so, being called to this sacred role and set apart for the high priesthood of God's holy order, they are to teach His commandments to mankind so that they, too, can find rest in Him.
This high priesthood follows the order of His Son, which has existed since the foundation of the world; it is eternal, with no beginning or end, prepared for all time according to God's foresight.
Now, they were set apart in this way—called to a holy role and established through a holy ordinance, taking on the high priesthood of the sacred order, which is eternal.
Thus, they become high priests forever after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who has no beginning or end, and who embodies grace, fairness, and truth. And that is the truth. Amen.
As I mentioned regarding this sacred order, many were appointed and became high priests of God because of their extraordinary faith, repentance, and righteousness, as they chose to repent and do good instead of perishing.
So, they were called to this sacred order, made holy, and their garments were cleaned through the blood of the Lamb.
After being purified by the Holy Spirit and having their garments made clean, standing pure and without blemish before God, they could not stand to look at sin except with disgust; and numerous, many individuals were made pure and found rest in the Lord, their God.
Now, my friends, I urge you to humble yourselves before God and produce evidence suitable for repentance, so that you can also find that rest.
Yes, humble yourselves like the people in Melchizedek's time, who was also a high priest following this same order, and who took on the high priesthood forever.
It was this same Melchizedek who received tithes from Abraham; indeed, our ancestor Abraham gave him one-tenth of everything he had.
These ordinances were given so that people could look forward to the Son of God, representing His order. This way, they might seek His forgiveness for their sins and find rest in the Lord.
Melchizedek was a king in Salem; his people had become strong in sin and wrongdoing; they had all gone astray, filled with all kinds of evil.
However, Melchizedek had great faith and received the high priesthood according to God's holy order. He preached repentance to his people, and behold, they repented. In his days, Melchizedek established peace in the land, therefore he was known as the prince of peace, as he ruled in Salem under his father.
Now, there had been many before him and many after him, but none were greater; thus, they specifically mention him more than others.
I don’t need to go into detail; what I have shared should be enough. Look, the scriptures are before you; if you twist them, it will lead to your own ruin.
Now, after Alma told them these things, he reached out his hand to them and proclaimed loudly: Now is the time to repent because the day of salvation is approaching.
Indeed, the voice of the Lord, through angels, is declaring this to all nations, sharing joyful news so that they may rejoice greatly. This good news is proclaimed among all His people, even to those scattered across the earth, and that is how it has reached us.
It has been clearly revealed to us, so we can understand without error because we are wanderers in a foreign land; thus, we are very fortunate to have this good news declared to us in all areas of our community.
For behold, angels are proclaiming it to many right now in our land; this is to prepare the hearts of humanity to receive His word when He comes in glory.
And now we are only waiting to hear the joyful announcement of His coming from the angels; for the time is coming, and we do not know how soon. I wish it could happen in my lifetime; however, whether it comes sooner or later, I will rejoice in it.
And it will be announced to righteous and holy men by angels at the time of His arrival, fulfilling the words of our ancestors about Him, which aligns with the spirit of prophecy that was in them.
Now, my friends, I sincerely wish, with deep concern even to the point of pain, that you would listen to my words, turn from your sins, and not delay your repentance;
Instead, I hope you would humble yourselves before the Lord, call upon His holy name, and keep watch and pray constantly, so you can resist temptations you can handle, being guided by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, gentle, submissive, patient, loving, and enduring.
Have faith in the Lord; hold on to the hope of receiving eternal life; keep the love of God in your hearts so that you may be lifted up at the end and find rest with Him.
May the Lord help you repent, so you don’t invoke His anger upon yourselves, so you aren't trapped by the chains of hell and do not face the second death.
And Alma spoke many more things to the people that are not recorded in this book.
