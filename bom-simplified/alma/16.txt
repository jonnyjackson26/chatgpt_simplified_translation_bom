In the eleventh year of the judges' rule over the Nephite people, on the fifth day of the second month, there had been a lot of peace in the land of Zarahemla, with no wars or disputes for several years. However, on that day, a cry for war was heard throughout the land.
The armies of the Lamanites had approached from the wilderness and entered the borders of the land, reaching the city of Ammonihah, where they began killing the people and destroying the city.
Before the Nephites could gather enough soldiers to fight back, the Lamanites had already killed the people in Ammonihah and some in the surrounding area, taking others captive and leading them into the wilderness.
The Nephites were eager to rescue their captured friends from the wilderness.
The chief captain of the Nephite armies, Zoram (who had two sons named Lehi and Aha), went to Alma, the high priest of the church, after hearing about his prophetic abilities. They asked him where they should go in the wilderness to find their fellow citizens taken captive by the Lamanites.
Alma sought guidance from the Lord regarding their request. He returned and told them that the Lamanites would cross the river Sidon in the southern wilderness, beyond the borders of the land of Manti. He instructed them to meet the Lamanites east of the river Sidon, where the Lord would help them rescue their captured brethren.
Zoram and his sons then crossed the river Sidon with their armies, continuing into the southern wilderness east of the river.
They encountered the Lamanite armies, who were scattered and forced back into the wilderness. They rescued their captured brethren; none were lost during this encounter. The rescued individuals were returned to their own lands.
Thus, the eleventh year of the judges concluded, with the Lamanites driven out and the city of Ammonihah completely destroyed, leaving every single Ammonihahite dead, despite their belief that their city could never be destroyed.
In just one day, it became desolate; the remains were devoured by dogs and wild animals from the wilderness.
Eventually, the bodies were piled up on the ground and covered with a light layer of earth. The smell of decay was so overwhelming that the people avoided the land of Ammonihah for many years, which was thereafter known as the Desolation of Nehors, named after the slain followers of Nehor, leaving the land empty.
The Lamanites did not attack the Nephites again until the fourteenth year of the judges' reign. For three years, the Nephite people lived in peace.
Alma and Amulek began preaching repentance to the people in their temples, sanctuaries, and synagogues, which were built in the Jewish tradition.
They shared God’s word with anyone willing to listen, showing no favoritism.
Alma, Amulek, and many others chosen for this task went throughout the land to preach, and the church became widely established among the Nephites.
There were no disparities among them, as the Lord poured out His Spirit across the land, preparing people's hearts and minds to receive the teachings that would be given at His coming.
This preparation was so that they would not turn away from the word, nor remain skeptical and face destruction, but instead welcome the teachings with joy and become connected to the true source of life, entering into the rest provided by God.
The priests who traveled among the people preached against lying, deceit, envy, conflict, malice, insults, theft, robbery, violence, adultery, and all other forms of wickedness, insisting that these behaviors were wrong.
They spoke of things that would happen soon, including the coming of the Son of God, his suffering and death, and the resurrection of the dead.
Many people asked about where the Son of God would eventually come, and they were taught that He would appear to them after His resurrection; the people received this news with great happiness.
Now, after the church had been firmly established across the land, having triumphed over evil with the pure word of God being shared everywhere and blessings poured upon the people, the fourteenth year of the judges’ reign among the Nephites came to an end.
