After Amalickiah became king, he started to provoke the Lamanites to rise up against the Nephites. He appointed people to speak out from their towers and incite the Lamanites against the Nephites.
He managed to instill hatred in the Lamanites, and by the end of the nineteenth year of the judges' reign, having achieved his plans so far and become king over the Lamanites, he wanted to rule over everyone in the land, including both Nephites and Lamanites.
His plans were successful, for he hardened the Lamanites' hearts, clouded their minds, and stirred up their anger, gathering a large army to fight against the Nephites.
Determined by the size of his army, he aimed to defeat the Nephites and enslave them.
He chose leaders from the Zoramites, who were familiar with the Nephites' strengths, their gathering places, and the weakest areas of their cities; these leaders he made the commanders of his forces.
Then they packed up their camp and moved towards Zarahemla through the wilderness.
While Amalickiah was gaining power through trickery, Moroni was busy preparing the hearts of the Nephites to stay faithful to their God.
He strengthened the Nephite armies and built small forts, creating earthen barriers to protect his troops and stone walls to surround their cities and lands.
He stationed the majority of his men in the weaker fortifications, thereby fortifying and reinforcing the areas held by the Nephites.
Moroni was getting ready to protect their liberty, homes, families, and peace so that they could serve the Lord and uphold what their enemies labeled the Christian cause.
Moroni was a strong and powerful leader, wise and not fond of violence; he valued the freedom and liberty of his homeland and his people.
He was grateful to God for the many blessings given to his people and dedicated considerable effort to ensure their safety and well-being.
He was also a firm believer in Christ, having pledged to defend his people, their rights, their land, and their faith, even if it cost him his life.
The Nephites were trained to defend against their enemies even if it meant shedding blood when necessary; they were also taught to avoid conflict unless it was to protect their lives.
This was their belief: by doing so, God would help them prosper in the land, meaning if they adhered to God's commandments, He would look after them; He would warn them to flee or prepare for battle as danger approached.
Moreover, God would guide them on how to defend themselves and, by following these instructions, He would save them; this was Moroni's faith, and he took pride in itâ€”not in violence, but in doing good, protecting his people, obeying God's commandments, and resisting wrongdoings.
Truly, I say to you, if everyone had been, is, or will be like Moroni, the very forces of evil would have been cast down forever, and the devil would have no power over people's hearts.
He was a man like Ammon, Mosiah's son, as well as the other sons of Mosiah and Alma with his sons, all of whom were righteous men of God.
Helaman and his brothers were just as valuable to the people as Moroni; they preached God's word and baptized anyone willing to listen to them.
So they went out, and the people repented because of their teachings, which led them to receive God's favor, allowing them to live without wars or conflicts for four years.
However, as I mentioned, towards the end of the nineteenth year, despite their peace, they found themselves reluctantly needing to fight against their Lamanite brethren.
Indeed, their wars with the Lamanites persisted for many years, despite their hesitance to engage.
They were saddened to take up arms against the Lamanites because they did not enjoy causing bloodshed; they were also troubled to be responsible for sending many of their kindred to the afterlife, unprepared to stand before God.
However, they could not allow themselves to sacrifice their lives while their wives and children faced being slaughtered by the brutal actions of those who were once their brothers, who had chosen to leave their faith and ally with the Lamanites to destroy them.
They could not tolerate the thought of their brethren celebrating over the deaths of the Nephites while there were still any among them who obeyed God's commandments, for the Lord's promise was clear: if they followed His commandments, they would prosper in the land.
