The teachings of Alma to his son Helaman.
This includes chapters 37.
Alma shares with Helaman about his transformation after encountering an angel—He endured the suffering of a lost soul; he called upon Jesus, and was then spiritually renewed—His heart overflowed with joy—He witnessed groups of angels praising God—Many believers have experienced what he has experienced. Around 74 B.C.
My son, pay attention to what I say; I promise you that if you follow God’s commandments, you will thrive in the land.
I hope you will remember our ancestors' slavery, as I have; they were trapped, and only the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob could save them, and He truly rescued them in their struggles.
And now, O my son Helaman, you are young, so I earnestly urge you to listen to my words and learn from me; for I know that anyone who trusts in God will be supported through their trials, struggles, and suffering, and will be upheld in the end.
And I don't want you to think I know this on my own—not about the physical, but about the spiritual, not from worldly knowledge but from God.
Look, I tell you, if I hadn’t been spiritually reborn, I wouldn’t know these things; but God revealed them to me through His holy angel, not because of any merit on my part;
For I once joined the sons of Mosiah in trying to destroy the church of God; but God sent His holy angel to stop us on our path.
And behold, he spoke to us like thunder, and the whole ground shook beneath us; and we all fell to the ground, overwhelmed by the fear of the Lord. 
But then, the voice told me: Get up. So I got up and stood, and saw the angel.
And he said to me: If you wish to destroy yourself, stop trying to destroy the church of God.
Then I fell to the ground; for three days and three nights, I couldn’t speak or move my body.
The angel continued to speak more to me, which my brothers heard, but I couldn’t hear them; for when I heard the words—If you wish to destroy yourself, stop trying to destroy the church of God—I was filled with such great fear and awe that I collapsed, and I didn’t hear anything else.
But I was tormented continually, for my soul was deeply troubled and anguished by all my sins.
Yes, I remembered all my wrongdoings and was tormented with the agony of hell; yes, I realized that I had turned against my God and had not followed his holy commandments.
Indeed, I had caused many of His children to fall away, leading them to destruction; my wrongdoings were so severe that just thinking about coming before my God caused indescribable dread in my soul.
Oh, I thought, if only I could be removed and cease to exist, both in body and spirit, so that I wouldn’t have to stand in front of my God to be judged for my actions.
And for three days and three nights, I was overwhelmed with anguish, as if my soul were in despair.
While I was in this torment, recalling my many sins, I remembered hearing my father prophesy to the people about the arrival of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who would atone for the sins of the world.
As this thought filled my mind, I cried out in my heart: O Jesus, Son of God, have compassion on me, who am trapped in bitterness and surrounded by the unending chains of death.
And as I thought this, I could no longer feel my anguish; I wasn't haunted by my sins anymore.
Oh, what joy and incredible light I experienced; my soul was filled with joy that surpassed the pain I had felt!
Yes, I tell you, my son, nothing could be as exquisite and bitter as my anguish. And I say again, my son, on the other side, nothing could be as exquisite and sweet as my joy.
I seemed to see, just as our father Lehi saw, God on His throne, surrounded by countless angels, singing praises to their God; and my soul longed to be there.
But my strength returned to my limbs, and I stood up, showing the people that I had been spiritually reborn.
And from that moment until now, I have worked tirelessly to help others repent; so they could experience the immense joy that I felt; that they too might be spiritually reborn and filled with the Holy Ghost.
And now, look, O my son, the Lord gives me great joy in the results of my efforts;
Because of the message He has given me, many have been spiritually reborn, and have tasted as I have, and have seen clearly as I have; therefore they know of these truths as I do; and the understanding I have comes from God.
Through every trial and hardship, I have been upheld; God has rescued me from prison, chains, and death; yes, I trust in Him, and He will continue to save me.
I know that He will raise me to be with Him in glory; yes, and I will praise Him forever, for He brought our ancestors out of Egypt, and drowned the Egyptians in the Red Sea; He guided them by His power into the promised land; yes, He has delivered them from oppression repeatedly.
Yes, He also brought our ancestors out of Jerusalem; and by His eternal power, He has saved them from bondage and confinement, time after time, even to this day; and I have always remembered their struggles; yes, and you too should remember, just as I have, their captivity.
But look, my son, this isn’t everything; you should know, as I do, that if you keep God’s commandments, you’ll thrive in the land; and also, if you don’t keep His commandments, you will be separated from His presence. This is according to His word.
