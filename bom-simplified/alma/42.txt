Mortality is a trial period for humans to have the chance to repent and serve God—The Fall caused both physical and spiritual death for everyone—Redemption is available through repentance—God Himself makes up for the sins of the world—Mercy is offered to those who repent—All others will face God's justice—Mercy exists because of the Atonement—Only those who truly repent will be saved. 
Now, my son, I notice there's something else bothering you that you can't quite comprehend—it's about God’s justice in punishing sinners; you seem to think it’s unfair for a sinner to face misery. 
Listen, my son, I will clarify this issue for you. After God sent our first parents out from the garden of Eden to work the ground where they were created—He removed the man and placed angels at the east side of the garden with a flaming sword that moved in all directions to guard the tree of life— 
Now we realize that the man had gained knowledge like God, understanding good and evil; and so that he wouldn’t reach for the tree of life, eat from it, and live forever, the Lord placed the angels and the flaming sword to prevent him from eating its fruit— 
Thus, we see that there was a period given to humanity to repent, yes, a time to repent and serve God. 
If Adam had immediately taken from the tree of life, he would have lived forever, as God had said, leaving no time for repentance; indeed, this would have made God’s word useless, and the wonderful plan of salvation would have been ruined. 
But understand this: it was ordained that man should die—so when they were separated from the tree of life, they would also be separated from the earth—and humanity became lost forever, yes, they became fallen. 
Now, you see that our first parents were cut off both physically and spiritually from God’s presence; thus, they became subjects to follow their own desires. 
It was not beneficial for man to be saved from this physical death, as that would ruin the great plan of happiness. 
So, since the soul can never die, and the Fall brought both physical and spiritual death upon everyone, meaning they were separated from God’s presence, it was necessary for humanity to be restored from this spiritual death. 
As they had become earthly, sensual, and sinful by nature, this trial state was meant for them to prepare; it became a time for preparation. 
And now remember, my son, without the plan of redemption, (putting it aside) after they died, their souls would be miserable, being cut off from the presence of God. 
There was no way to bring people back from this fallen state, which they had brought on themselves due to their own disobedience; 
So, according to justice, the plan of redemption couldn’t unfold without the condition of individual repentance in this trial state; yes, this preparatory time; for without these conditions, mercy would not function except it would destroy the work of justice. The work of justice cannot be destroyed; otherwise, God would stop being God. 
Thus, we see that all mankind had fallen, and they were stuck in the grasp of justice; yes, the justice of God, which condemned them to be cut off from His presence forever. 
Now, the plan of mercy could not happen unless an atonement was made; therefore God Himself makes atonement for the sins of the world, to implement the plan of mercy, satisfying the demands of justice so that God can be both perfect in justice and merciful. 
Now, repentance could not come to people unless there was a punishment, which was also eternal like the soul's life, opposing the eternal plan of happiness. 
Now, how could a person repent unless they sinned? How could they sin if there was no law? How could there be a law unless there were a punishment? 
There was a punishment set and a fair law given, which caused guilt to weigh on man's conscience. 
If there were no law stating that a person who murdered would die—would that person fear death if they murdered? 
If there was no law against sin, people wouldn’t be afraid to sin. 
And if there was no law given, if individuals sinned, what claim could justice or mercy have, since they would have no authority over the individual? 
But a law has been established, along with punishment, and repentance is allowed; this repentance is claimed by mercy; otherwise, justice claims the person and enforces the law, applying the punishment; otherwise, justice’s work would be dismantled, and God would cease to be God. 
But God never stops being God, and mercy claims the repentant, and mercy exists because of the atonement; the atonement leads to the resurrection of the dead; the resurrection brings people back into God’s presence; and so they are restored to His presence to be judged based on their actions, according to law and justice. 
Indeed, justice fulfills all its demands, and mercy claims everything that belongs to her; thus, only those who truly repent are saved. 
Do you think mercy can take away from justice? I tell you, No; not at all. If that were so, God would cease to be God. 
Thus God fulfills His grand and eternal plans, which were prepared from the beginning of the world. This is how the salvation and redemption of mankind come about, along with their destruction and suffering. 
So, my son, anyone who wishes to come may come and freely drink from the waters of life; and whoever does not wish to come is not forced to, but on the last day, they will receive back according to their deeds. 
If someone has wished to do evil and hasn’t repented during their life, look, evil will come upon them, according to God's restoration. 
Now, my son, I hope you let these issues bother you no more, and just let your sins trouble you, with a remorse that leads you to repentance. 
My son, I desire that you should stop questioning God’s justice. Do not try to lessen your guilt for your sins by denying God’s justice; instead, let God’s justice, mercy, and patience have full control in your heart, and let it bring you down in humility. 
Now, my son, you are called by God to preach the word to this people. Now, my son, go forth and declare the word with truth and seriousness, so that you can bring souls to repentance, thereby allowing the great plan of mercy to lay claim upon them. And may God grant you according to my words. Amen.
