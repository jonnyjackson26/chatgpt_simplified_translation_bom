When the Lamanites who had fought against the Nephites realized that all their efforts to destroy them were futile, they returned to the land of Nephi.
The Amalekites, upset over their losses, became very angry. Unable to take revenge on the Nephites, they began to incite the people against the Anti-Nephi-Lehies and sought to harm them again.
The Anti-Nephi-Lehi people chose not to defend themselves and willingly accepted death at the hands of their enemies.
When Ammon and his brothers witnessed the destruction of the people they loved, who had shown them deep affection in return—viewing them as divine messengers sent to save them from destruction—they were filled with compassion. They approached the king and said:
Let's gather the Lord's people and flee to Zarahemla to escape our enemies and avoid being destroyed.
But the king responded: The Nephites will kill us because of all the murders and sins we have committed against them.
Ammon replied: I will seek guidance from the Lord. If He tells us to go to our brethren, will you go?
The king answered: Yes, if the Lord instructs us to go, we will become their servants until we make amends for our wrongdoings.
But Ammon said: According to the law established by my father, there can be no slaves among our people. So, let's go and trust in the mercy of our brethren.
The king said: Seek the Lord's guidance, and if He tells us to go, we will go; otherwise, we will perish here.
Ammon then prayed to the Lord, who instructed him:
Lead this people out of this land to avoid destruction; for Satan has a strong influence over the Amalekites, who are inciting the Lamanites to kill their brethren. Therefore, get out of this land; blessed are this people because I will protect them.
Ammon returned and shared all the Lord's words with the king.
They gathered all the Lord's people, along with their livestock, leaving their homeland and heading into the wilderness that separated Nephi from Zarahemla, approaching the borders of the land.
Ammon told them: I and my brothers will go to Zarahemla, and you will stay here until we return; we will test whether our brethren will allow you into their land.
As Ammon entered Zarahemla, he and his brothers encountered Alma at the location mentioned, resulting in a joyful reunion.
Ammon was overwhelmed with joy, feeling so happy that it exhausted his strength and made him fall to the ground.
Wasn't this immense joy? This kind of joy is only felt by those who sincerely repent and genuinely seek happiness.
Alma's joy at seeing his brothers was very great, and so was the joy of Aaron, Omner, and Himni; however, their joy did not overpower them.
Alma took his brothers to his home in Zarahemla and shared everything that had happened to them in the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites, with the chief judge.
The chief judge then proclaimed throughout the land, asking the people's opinion on allowing their brethren, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies, to join them.
The people responded: We will give the land of Jershon, located east by the sea, near Bountiful in the south, to our brethren for their inheritance.
We will position our armies between Jershon and Nephi to protect our brethren there; we do this because they fear taking up arms against their brethren to avoid committing sins. They fear this greatly because of their deep repentance regarding their many murders and wickedness.
We will offer our help in this way to our brethren for them to inherit the land of Jershon, in exchange for a portion of their resources to help maintain our armies.
When Ammon heard this, he returned to the Anti-Nephi-Lehi people, accompanied by Alma, to their camp in the wilderness and shared all this information with them. Alma also spoke of his conversion and his experience with Ammon, Aaron, and the others.
This news filled them with great joy. They then went down to the land of Jershon and claimed it as theirs; they were known as the people of Ammon by the Nephites, and that name stuck with them from then on.
They lived among the Nephites and were part of the church of God. They stood out for their zeal towards God and humanity, being completely honest and upright in all their dealings, and they remained firm in their faith in Christ until the end.
They viewed the idea of killing their brethren with disgust and refused to fight against them. They did not fear death, as they held onto hope in Christ and the resurrection; for them, death was overcome by Christ’s victory over it.
Thus, they were willing to endure the most severe and painful death at the hands of their brethren, rather than resort to violence against them.
This is how they became a passionate and beloved people, highly favored by the Lord.
