The Nephites who survived the battle, after burying their dead—who were countless and could not be tallied—returned to their homes, wives, and children after completing the burials.
Many women and children had died by the sword, along with numerous flocks and herds; their fields of grain were also destroyed because they had been trampled by the armies.
Now, many of the slain Lamanites and Amlicites along the river Sidon were thrown into its waters; their bones lay in the depths of the sea, and there were many of them.
The Amlicites were marked differently from the Nephites; they painted red on their foreheads like the Lamanites, but they did not shave their heads like the Lamanites did.
The Lamanites had shaved heads and wore minimal clothing, just skin around their waists, along with their armor, bows, arrows, stones, and slings.
The Lamanites had dark skin, a mark passed down from their ancestors, a curse due to their wrongdoing and rebellion against their brothers, Nephi, Jacob, Joseph, and Sam, who were righteous individuals.
Their brothers sought to destroy them, and as a result, they were cursed; God put a mark on Laman, Lemuel, the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelite women.
This marking was to keep their descendants separate from their brothers, allowing God to protect His people, preventing them from mixing with incorrect beliefs that would lead to their downfall.
Anyone who mingled their descendants with the Lamanites also brought the same curse upon their future generations.
Thus, anyone who allowed themselves to be led by the Lamanites was identified with them and marked accordingly.
Anyone who refused to accept Lamanite traditions—believing instead in the records brought from Jerusalem and the correct teachings of their ancestors who followed God's commandments—was called a Nephite, or people of Nephi, from then on.
These Nephites maintained true records about themselves and the Lamanites.
Now, let's return to the Amlicites; they too had a mark on themselves, having chosen to mark themselves with red on their foreheads.
This fulfills God's word, for He told Nephi that He would place a mark on the Lamanites to keep them and their descendants separate from Nephi and his descendants, unless they repented and sought His mercy.
Again, He said that anyone who mixed their descendants with Nephi's brothers would be marked and cursed.
And again, He declared that anyone who fought against Nephi and his descendants would also be marked.
He stated again that anyone who left Nephi's group would no longer be called his descendants; though He would bless Nephi and those who would still be recognized as his descendants forever. These were the promises God made to Nephi and his lineage.
The Amlicites did not realize they were fulfilling God's words when they began marking their foreheads; they were openly rebelling against Him, which made it fitting for them to receive the curse.
I want you to understand that they brought this curse upon themselves; every cursed individual ultimately brings their own condemnation.
Not long after the battle in Zarahemla between the Lamanites and Amlicites, another Lamanite army attacked the Nephites in the same location as the first encounter with the Amlicites.
An army was sent to drive the Lamanites out of their territory.
Alma, who was wounded, did not personally lead the charge against the Lamanites this time.
Instead, he sent a large army to confront them; they killed many Lamanites and pushed the rest out of their territory.
Afterwards, they returned and worked to establish peace in the land, no longer troubled by enemies for some time.
All these events, including the wars and conflicts, began and ended in the fifth year of the judges' reign.
In that year, thousands upon thousands of souls moved on to the next world to receive their rewards based on their deeds, whether good or bad, leading to eternal happiness or misery, depending on which spirit they chose to follow, be it good or bad.
Every individual receives rewards from the one they choose to obey; this aligns with the spirit of prophecy, and thus it should be recognized as truth. This concludes the record of the fifth year of the judges' reign.
