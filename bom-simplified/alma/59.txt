In the thirtieth year of the judges' rule over the Nephite people, Moroni felt a great joy after reading Helaman's letter, celebrating the incredible success Helaman had in reclaiming the lands that were previously lost.
He shared this good news with everyone in the surrounding areas, encouraging them to rejoice as well.
Right away, he wrote to Pahoran, asking him to gather more men to support Helaman's forces so that Helaman could easily defend the areas he had successfully regained.
As Moroni sent this letter to Zarahemla, he started planning again to reclaim the rest of the lands and cities that the Lamanites had taken from the Nephites.
While Moroni was preparing to fight the Lamanites, the people of Nephihah, who had come together from the cities of Moroni, Lehi, and Morianton, were suddenly attacked by the Lamanites.
Some of those who had been forced to flee from Manti and the surrounding areas joined the Lamanites in this part of the land.
Thus the Lamanites grew in number and strength daily, and under Ammoron's command, they aggressively attacked the people of Nephihah, causing a great slaughter.
There were so many of the Lamanites that the remaining people of Nephihah had to retreat, eventually joining Moroniâ€™s army.
Moroni had expected reinforcements to be sent to Nephihah to help protect it, knowing it would be easier to keep it from falling to the Lamanites than to recover it once lost. He believed they would successfully hold the city.
Therefore, he kept all of his forces focused on maintaining the areas he had already reclaimed.
When Moroni realized that Nephihah had been lost, he felt deep sorrow and began to doubt the loyalty of the people, fearing they might fall into the hands of their own kin.
This uncertainty was shared by all his top commanders, who also doubted and were troubled by the wickedness of the people, especially given the Lamanites' successes against them.
Moroni grew angry with the government due to their neglect regarding the freedom of their country.
