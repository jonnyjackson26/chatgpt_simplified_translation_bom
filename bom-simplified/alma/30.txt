Korihor, the false prophet, mocks Christ, the Atonement, and the spirit of prophecy—He teaches that God does not exist, that there is no fall of man, there are no consequences for sin, and there is no Christ—Alma bears witness that Christ will come and that everything indicates there is a God—Korihor asks for a sign and is made unable to speak—The devil had appeared to Korihor as an angel and taught him what to say—Korihor is defeated and dies. About 76–74 B.C.
Now it happened that once the Ammonites had settled in the land of Jershon, and after the Lamanites had been driven out and their dead buried by the people—
Their dead were not counted because there were so many; neither were the Nephite dead counted—but after burying their dead, and after days of fasting, mourning, and praying, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the judges' reign over the people of Nephi) peace started to reign throughout the land.
Indeed, the people followed the Lord's commandments; they were dedicated to keeping God’s laws, in accordance with the law of Moses, since they had been taught to keep the law until it was fulfilled.
Thus, there was no disturbance during the entire sixteenth year of the judges' reign over the people of Nephi.
It also happened that at the start of the seventeenth year of the judges' reign, peace continued.
But toward the end of the seventeenth year, a man came to the land of Zarahemla, and he was an Anti-Christ because he began to preach against the prophecies given by the prophets about Christ’s coming.
There was no law preventing a person from believing what they wanted; for making a law that put people at a disadvantage was strictly against God's commands.
For the scriptures say: Choose today whom you will serve.
If someone wanted to serve God, they had that right; or rather, if they believed in God, they could serve Him; but if they didn't believe, there was no law punishing them.
However, if someone committed murder, they were punished with death; if someone robbed, they faced punishment; if someone stole, they were punished; if someone committed adultery, they were also punished; yes, for all these wrongdoings, there were consequences.
For there was a law that people were judged based on their crimes. Still, there was no law against a person's beliefs; therefore, a person was punished only for the offenses they committed, giving everyone equal treatment.
This Anti-Christ, named Korihor, (who was beyond the law’s reach) began to preach that there would be no Christ. He preached like this:
Oh, you who are burdened by foolish and empty hope, why do you tie yourselves to such nonsense? Why do you seek a Christ? No one can know anything that’s to come.
Look, these things you call prophecies, which you claim were given by holy prophets, are merely silly traditions passed down from your ancestors.
How do you know they are true? You can’t know things you can't see; therefore you can’t know that a Christ will come.
You say you see your sins being forgiven. But look, that is just a sign of a disturbed mind; the craziness of your thoughts comes from your parents' traditions that make you believe in falsehoods.
He said many more things, claiming that there could be no atonement for human sins, and that everyone experiences life based on their own actions; therefore, each person prospers based on their intelligence, and every person succeeds based on their strength; whatever a person does is not a crime.
Thus, he preached to them, leading many away and encouraging them in their wickedness, yes, leading both men and women to commit sexual immorality—telling them that once a person dies, that is the end of it all.
This man also went to the land of Jershon to preach to the Ammonites, who had once been Lamanites.
But they were wiser than many Nephites; they captured him and took him to Ammon, who was a high priest over them.
He then made sure Korihor was expelled from the land. Korihor moved on to the land of Gideon and started preaching there too; however, he found little success, as he was captured and brought before the high priest and the chief judge of the land.
The high priest asked him: Why do you go around twisting the teachings of the Lord? Why do you tell this people that there is no Christ, disrupting their joy? Why do you speak against all the prophecies of the holy prophets?
The high priest's name was Giddonah. Korihor replied: Because I don't teach the silly traditions of your ancestors, and I don't encourage this people to bind themselves to the foolish rituals set by ancient priests, who seek power and authority over them and keep them in ignorance, preventing them from standing up for themselves.
You claim this people is free. I say they are in bondage. You claim that those ancient prophecies are true. I say you don’t really know if they are true.
You say that this people is guilty and fallen because of a parent's wrongdoing. I say that a child cannot be blamed for the actions of their parents.
You also say that Christ will come. But I say you don’t know if Christ will come. And you say that He will be killed for the sins of the world—
And in this way, you mislead this people, following the silly traditions of your ancestors and your own desires; you keep them down like they are enslaved just to satisfy yourselves with their hard work, making them afraid to look up with confidence and enjoy their rights.
Yes, they are afraid to use what is rightfully theirs for fear of offending their priests, who manipulate them according to their desires, leading them to believe through their traditions, dreams, whims, visions, and pretended mysteries, that they might offend some unseen being they call God—a being who has never been seen or known and never will be.
When the high priest and the chief judge saw how stubborn Korihor was, and that he would even insult God, they chose not to respond to him; instead, they ordered him bound and handed him over to the officers to be taken to the land of Zarahemla, so that he could stand before Alma and the chief judge who governed all the land.
When he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he continued in the same way he had in the land of Gideon; yes, he started to insult again.
He stood before Alma with grandiose words, criticizing the priests and teachers for misleading the people with the ridiculous traditions of their ancestors, just to take advantage of them.
Alma said to him: You know that we do not take advantage of this people’s labor; for I have worked with my own hands for my living since the very beginning of the judges' reign, despite my many travels to share God’s word with the people.
And despite my numerous efforts within the church, I have never received even a small payment for my work; none of my fellow workers have either, except when serving in the judgment seat, and then we only received according to the law for our time.
So if we don’t receive anything for our efforts in the church, then why do we work there except to share the truth, so we can rejoice in the joy of our people?
Then why do you say that we preach to the people for personal gain, when you know we receive nothing? Do you really believe we are deceiving this people, who find joy in their hearts?
Korihor answered him, Yes.
Then Alma asked him: Do you believe there is a God?
He replied, No.
Alma said: Will you again deny that there is a God and deny Christ? I tell you, I know there is a God and that Christ will come.
Now what proof do you have that there is no God or that Christ will not come? I tell you, you have no proof, except for your own words.
But I have all things as proof that these things are true; and you have all things as evidence that they are true; will you deny them? Do you believe these things are true?
I know you believe, but you are influenced by a lying spirit, having shut out the Spirit of God so it cannot dwell in you; thus, the devil has power over you, and he leads you around, creating schemes to destroy God’s children.
Korihor then said to Alma: If you will show me a sign so I can be convinced there is a God, yes, show me that He has power, and then I will accept your words as true.
But Alma replied: You have seen enough signs; will you test your God? Will you demand a sign after you have the testimony of all your brethren and all the holy prophets? The scriptures are before you; everything indicates there is a God; even the earth and all that is on it, and its movement, and the planets moving in their paths testify that there is a Supreme Creator.
Yet you continue to lead this people away, convincing them there is no God? Will you still deny all these witnesses? He answered: Yes, I will deny, unless you show me a sign.
Alma then said: I am saddened by the stubbornness of your heart, that you continue to resist the truth, putting your soul at risk of destruction.
But it would be better for your soul to be lost than for you to lead many souls to destruction with your lies and flattering words; if you deny again, God will strike you so you will be unable to speak, and you will no longer be able to deceive this people.
Korihor responded: I don’t deny that a God exists, but I don’t believe in a God; and I also say that you do not know there is a God; unless you show me a sign, I will not believe.
Alma said to him: Here’s your sign: you will become unable to speak, just as I have said; according to the word of God, you shall be struck dumb, and you will not be able to speak again.
When Alma finished saying this, Korihor became unable to speak, exactly as Alma had declared.
When the chief judge saw this, he reached out and wrote to Korihor, asking: Are you convinced of God’s power? Who did you expect Alma to show a sign to? Do you want him to harm others to prove it? Look, he has given you a sign; will you still argue?
Korihor reached out his hand and wrote, saying: I know I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that only by the power of God could this happen to me; yes, and I always knew there was a God.
But the devil has deceived me; he appeared to me as an angel and told me: Go and lead this people astray, for they have all gone after an unknown God. He said to me: There is no God; yes, and he taught me what to say. I taught his words because they appealed to the earthly mind; I taught them until I truly believed they were true; and because of this, I resisted the truth, ultimately bringing this great curse upon myself.
After he said this, he begged Alma to pray to God to remove the curse from him.
But Alma said to him: If this curse is removed, you will again lead this people astray; therefore it will be as the Lord decides.
Eventually, the curse was not removed from Korihor; he was cast out and went from house to house begging for food.
The news of what had happened to Korihor quickly spread throughout the land; yes, the chief judge sent out a proclamation to all the people, warning those who had believed Korihor’s words to repent quickly, or they would face the same consequences.
They were all convinced of Korihor’s wickedness; therefore they turned back to the Lord, putting an end to the wrongdoing associated with Korihor. Korihor went from house to house, begging for food.
As he wandered among the people, among a group who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, led by a man named Zoram—while among them, he was attacked and trampled to death.
Thus we see the end of one who distorts the ways of the Lord; and we see that the devil will not support his followers in the end but will quickly drag them down to destruction.
