A story about the preaching of Aaron, Muloki, and their companions to the Lamanites.
Including chapters through 25.
Aaron teaches the Amalekites about Christ and His sacrifice—Aaron and his companions are imprisoned in Middoni—After being freed, they preach in the synagogues and convert many—Lamoni allows the people in the land of Ishmael to practice their religion freely. Around 90–77 B.C.
When Ammon and his companions went away from the edge of the Lamanite territory, Aaron traveled to a place the Lamanites called Jerusalem, named after the land where their ancestors were born; it was located near the borders of Mormon.
The Lamanites, the Amalekites, and the people of Amulon built a large city named Jerusalem.
The Lamanites were already very stubborn, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were even more so; this made the Lamanites harden their hearts and grow stronger in their wickedness and wrongdoing.
Aaron reached the city of Jerusalem and began preaching to the Amalekites. He spoke to them in their synagogues, as they had built them following the Nehor tradition; many Amalekites and Amulonites followed this same way.
As Aaron entered one of the synagogues to preach, an Amalekite stood up and challenged him, saying: What are you preaching about? Have you seen an angel? Why don’t angels come to us? Aren’t our people just as good as yours?
You also say that if we don’t repent, we will perish. How do you know what we’re thinking and feeling? How can you say we need to repent? How do you know we’re not a righteous people? Look, we’ve built places of worship, and we gather together to praise God. We believe God will save everyone.
Aaron replied: Do you believe that the Son of God will come to save people from their sins?
The man responded: We don’t believe you know anything about that. We think these are silly traditions. We don’t believe you know about the future, nor that your ancestors or ours really understood what they spoke about regarding what’s to come.
Aaron began to explain the scriptures about the coming of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and that no one can be redeemed from their sins without Christ’s death, suffering, and sacrifice.
As he explained these things, the people became angry and mocked him; they refused to listen to his words.
So, when Aaron saw they wouldn’t listen, he left their synagogue and went to a village called Ani-Anti, where he found Muloki preaching to the people, along with Ammah and his companions. They argued with many about what they were teaching.
They recognized that the people were hardening their hearts, so they left and went to the land of Middoni. They preached to many, but few accepted their message.
Despite this, Aaron and some of his companions were captured and thrown into prison, while the others fled into the surrounding areas.
Those who were imprisoned endured many hardships until Lamoni and Ammon rescued them, providing them with food and clothing.
After their first release from prison, they went out to preach again, having suffered greatly.
They traveled wherever the Spirit guided them, spreading God's word in every Amalekite synagogue or at any Lamanite gathering that welcomed them.
Eventually, the Lord began to bless them, leading many people to understand the truth; they convinced many of their sins and challenged the incorrect traditions of their ancestors.
Ammon and Lamoni returned from Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was their homeland.
King Lamoni insisted that Ammon should not serve him or be his servant.
Instead, he ordered synagogues to be built in the land of Ishmael and gathered his people to worship together.
He was joyful about them and taught them many things. He also informed them that they were his subjects but were free people, liberated from the oppression of his father; his father had allowed him to rule over the people in Ishmael and nearby.
He assured them they could freely worship the Lord their God as they wished, in any place under King Lamoni's rule.
Ammon preached to King Lamoni’s people and taught them everything related to righteousness. He encouraged them every day with dedication, and they listened to his words, becoming eager to follow God’s commandments.
