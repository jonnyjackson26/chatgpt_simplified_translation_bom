The Book of Alma, the Son of Alma
This is the story of Alma, the son of Alma, who was the first and main judge of the Nephite people, and also the high priest of the Church. It tells about the time when judges ruled, along with the wars and conflicts among the people. It also describes a war between the Nephites and the Lamanites, based on the record of Alma, the first and main judge.
Nehor teaches misleading beliefs, sets up a church, promotes priestcraft, and kills Gideon—Nehor is punished for his actions—Priestcraft and persecution spread among the people—The priests take care of themselves, the community looks after the poor, and the Church thrives. About 91–88 B.C.
At the beginning of the judges' rule over the Nephites, after king Mosiah had passed away, having fought valiantly and lived righteously before God, leaving no one to take his place; still, he had created laws that the people accepted, so they were required to follow those laws.
During Alma's first year as judge, a strong man was brought to him for judgment.
This man traveled among the people, preaching what he claimed was the word of God, opposing the church; insisting that every priest and teacher should be popular and should not work with their hands, but should be supported by the people.
He also proclaimed that all people would be saved in the end, that they should not fear but lift their heads and rejoice, for God had created and redeemed all mankind, and ultimately everyone would have eternal life.
He preached these ideas so effectively that many believed in him, enough to start giving him money.
He became prideful and wore expensive clothing, and even started a church that mirrored his teachings.
As he was on his way to preach to his followers, he encountered Gideon, a teacher from the church of God, and argued fiercely with him in an attempt to sway the church members; but Gideon stood firm, advising him with the words of God.
Gideon was the one God used to help free the people of Limhi from captivity.
Angered by Gideon's resistance, Nehor attacked him with a sword, and because Gideon was older and unable to defend himself, he was killed.
The church members captured Nehor and brought him to Alma for judgment based on his crimes.
When he stood before Alma, he defended himself boldly.
Alma responded: This is the first time that priestcraft has appeared among our people. You are guilty of priestcraft and attempted to enforce it with violence; if priestcraft spreads among us, it will lead to our total ruin.
You have taken the life of a righteous man, someone who has done great good for our people; if we were to spare you, we would face his blood's vengeance.
Therefore, you are sentenced to death, as per the law established by our last king, Mosiah, which the people have accepted; thus, they must follow this law.
They took him, a man named Nehor, to the top of the hill Manti, where he confessed between heaven and earth that what he had taught was against God's word; there he met a shameful death.
However, this did not stop the spread of priestcraft throughout the land, as many were attracted to the false glamor of the world and began preaching lies for the sake of wealth and status.
Still, they did not dare to lie openly for fear of the law, as lying brought punishment; so instead, they pretended to preach what they claimed to believe, and the law had no power over anyone for their beliefs.
They also feared theft due to legal consequences, so they refrained from stealing, robbing, or killing—murderers faced the death penalty.
But those outside the church began to attack those who belonged to the church and called themselves followers of Christ.
They oppressed and insulted the believers due to their humility, as the believers did not see themselves as better and shared God's word freely without charging.
There was also a strict law in the church that no member could harass those outside the church, and there should be no infighting among each other.
Nonetheless, some members became proud and argued fiercely with their opponents, even to the point of fighting each other.
In Alma's second year in office, this caused great distress for the church and brought many trials.
Many hearts became hardened, and their names were removed from among God’s people; many left the church.
This was a significant test for those who remained faithful; yet, they remained steadfast, unwavering in following God's commandments, patiently enduring the persecution directed at them.
When the priests stopped their work to share God’s word, the people also paused their tasks to listen, and after receiving the word, they returned to their work. The priests did not consider themselves superior to their listeners; they were all equals, working hard according to their abilities.
They shared their resources generously, helping the poor, needy, sick, and afflicted, without wearing extravagant clothes, though they remained tidy and presentable.
Thus, they managed the church's activities, and they experienced lasting peace despite ongoing persecution.
Because of their unity, the church became notably wealthy, having plenty of everything they needed: large groups of livestock, grain, gold, silver, valuable items, fine silk, high-quality linen, and all sorts of good, practical fabrics.
In their prosperity, they did not turn away anyone who was naked, hungry, thirsty, sick, or lacking nourishment; they did not covet wealth and were generous to everyone, regardless of their status, be they young or old, free or enslaved, male or female—inside or outside the church.
In this way, they thrived and grew much richer than those outside their church.
Those outside the church indulged in sorcery, idolatry, laziness, endless chatter, envy, and conflict; they wore expensive clothes, were prideful, and participated in all kinds of wickedness like persecution, lying, stealing, committing adultery, and murder; nevertheless, the law was enforced on anyone who broke it whenever possible.
By enforcing the law upon them, everyone faced consequences for their actions; they became quieter and were less likely to act wickedly if their deeds became known, resulting in significant peace among the Nephite people until the fifth year of the judges' reign.
