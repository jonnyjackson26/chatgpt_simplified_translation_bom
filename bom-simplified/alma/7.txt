The teachings of Alma that he shared with the people in Gideon, based on his own account.
This includes chapter 7.
Jesus will be born to Mary—He will overcome death and carry the sins of His people—Those who repent, are baptized, and follow the commandments will have eternal life—Sin cannot enter the kingdom of God—Humility, faith, hope, and charity are necessary. Around 83 B.C.
My dear friends, since I have been allowed to come to you, I will speak to you in my own words; this is the first time I am talking directly to you since I have mostly been busy with the judgment seat and couldn’t visit you.
I wouldn’t be here now if the judgment seat hadn’t been given to someone else, allowing me to come; the Lord has shown me mercy by allowing me to visit you.
I come with great hopes and a strong desire to find that you have humbled yourselves before God and have been continuously seeking His grace, and that you are blameless in His sight, unlike our brothers in Zarahemla who were in a terrible situation.
But I am grateful to God for allowing me to know that they have returned to His righteousness.
I have faith, based on the Spirit of God that is within me, that I will find joy in you as well; however, I don’t wish for my joy to come from the sorrows and hardships that I felt for our brothers in Zarahemla, since my joy regarding them was preceded by much suffering.
But I trust that you are not in the same disbelief as your brothers; I trust you are not consumed by pride; I trust you have not set your hearts on riches or worldly things; I trust you do not worship idols, but rather the true and living God, and that you look forward to the forgiveness of your sins with everlasting faith.
For I tell you there are many future events to come; but one thing matters more than all others—soon the Redeemer will live and come among His people.
I do not say that He will come to us while living in His mortal body; for the Spirit has not revealed this to me. I do not know this for certain, but I do know that God has the power to fulfill His promises.
Yet, the Spirit has told me to cry out to you—Repent, prepare for the Lord, and walk in His straight paths; for the kingdom of heaven is close, and the Son of God is about to come to the earth.
He will be born to Mary, in Jerusalem, which is our ancestral land; she is a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who will conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost and will bear the Son of God.
He will face pain, suffering, and temptations of every kind, fulfilling the prophecy that states He will take upon Himself the pains and sicknesses of His people.
He will take on death to free His people from its grasp; He will bear their weaknesses, so He can have compassion for them and understand their struggles.
The Spirit knows everything; nonetheless, the Son of God suffers in the flesh to take on the sins of His people and erase their wrongdoings through His power; and this is my witness.
I urge you to repent and be born again; for the Spirit says that unless you are born again, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven; so come and be baptized as a sign of your repentance, to be cleansed from your sins, and to have faith in the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world and can save you from all wrongdoing.
Yes, I invite you to come without fear, and to put aside every sin that binds you and leads you to destruction; show God that you are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a promise to keep His commandments, confirming it to Him today by being baptized.
Whoever does this and keeps God's commandments afterwards will remember my words: he will have eternal life, as confirmed by the Holy Spirit within me.
Now, my dear friends, do you believe these things? I know you do, and I know because of the Spirit's witness within me. Because of your strong faith in these matters, my joy is great.
As I mentioned before, I've desired you not to be in the troubled state of your brothers, and I am happy to see that my desires have been fulfilled.
I can see that you are on the right paths; I can see you are walking the way that leads to God's kingdom; yes, you are making His paths straight.
I see that it has been made clear to you by His word that He cannot walk in crooked paths; He does not change what He says; He remains straight and true; therefore, His ways are eternally consistent.
He does not dwell in unholy places; nothing unclean can enter into the kingdom of God; thus, I tell you that in the last days, the unclean will remain in their unclean state.
I have shared these words with you to awaken your sense of duty to God, so you may walk blamelessly before Him and follow the holy path for which you have been accepted.
I want you to be humble, submissive, gentle, easy to approach; full of patience and enduring hardships; self-disciplined in everything; diligent in consistently keeping God’s commandments; asking for what you need, both spiritually and in daily matters; and always giving thanks to God for whatever He provides.
Ensure you have faith, hope, and charity, and with that, you will continually do good works.
May the Lord bless you and keep your lives pure, so that in the end, you may join Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and holy prophets from the beginning of the world, with your purity being as theirs in the kingdom of heaven forever.
Now, my dear friends, I have spoken these things according to the Spirit within me; my soul rejoices greatly because of your attentiveness to my words.
Now, may God’s peace be upon you, your homes, lands, flocks, herds, and everything you have, including your women and children, based on your faith and good actions, from this day onward forever. Thus, I have spoken. Amen.
