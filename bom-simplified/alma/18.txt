King Lamoni asked his servants to step forward and share everything they witnessed about what had happened.
After they all shared what they had seen, and he learned about Ammon’s faithfulness in protecting his animals and his great power in fighting off those who tried to kill him, he was incredibly amazed and said: Surely, this is more than just a man. Isn’t this the Great Spirit who punishes our people for their murders?
They replied to the king: We don’t know if he is the Great Spirit or just a man; however, we do know this much: he cannot be killed by your enemies, and he can’t let them scatter your livestock when he’s with us because of his skill and strength. So, we believe he is a friend to you, king. We don’t think any man has that much power, as we know he can’t be killed.
When the king heard these words, he said: Now I understand that it is the Great Spirit; he has come down to protect your lives so that I won’t kill you like I did your brothers. This is the Great Spirit my ancestors talked about.
This was a belief that Lamoni had received from his father, that there is a Great Spirit. Even though they believed in a Great Spirit, they thought everything they did was right; still, Lamoni started to fear greatly, worried that he had done wrong by killing his servants.
He had killed many of them because their brothers had caused their flocks to scatter at the water source; and thus, because their animals had been scattered, they were slain.
The Lamanites often waited by the waters of Sebus to scatter the people’s flocks, aiming to drive many of them to their own land; this was a practice of raiding among them.
Then King Lamoni asked his servants: Where is this man with such great power?
They told him: Look, he is feeding your horses. The king had instructed his servants, before watering their animals, to prepare his horses and chariots to take him to the land of Nephi where a grand feast was planned by Lamoni’s father, who ruled over all the land.
When King Lamoni learned that Ammon was getting his horses and chariots ready, he was even more amazed at Ammon’s loyalty, saying: No servant has ever been so faithful as this man; he remembers all my orders and carries them out.
Now I definitely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I wish for him to come to me, but I am afraid to do so.
After Ammon had prepared the horses and chariots for the king and his servants, he approached the king and noticed that the king’s face had changed; so he was going to leave his presence.
One of the king’s servants spoke to him, saying: Rabbanah, which means powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and he said: Rabbanah, the king wants you to stay.
So Ammon turned to the king and asked: What do you want me to do for you, O king? But the king didn’t answer for about an hour because he didn’t know what to say.
And then Ammon asked again: What do you want from me? Still, the king didn’t reply.
As Ammon was filled with God’s Spirit, he sensed the king’s thoughts. He said: Is it because you heard how I defended your servants and your flocks, killed seven of their attackers with a sling and sword, and cut off the arms of others to protect your livestock and servants; is that what amazes you?
I ask you, what is it that seems so astonishing to you? Look, I am just a man and your servant; so whatever you desire that is right, I will do it.
When the king heard these words, he marveled again, realizing that Ammon could read his thoughts, but despite this, King Lamoni spoke up and asked: Who are you? Are you that Great Spirit who knows everything?
Ammon responded: I am not.
The king then said: How do you know what’s in my heart? You can speak confidently and explain these things to me; also tell me how you managed to kill and cut off my brothers’ arms who scattered my flocks—
And if you tell me these things, I will give you whatever you want; and if needed, I would protect you with my armies; although I know you are more powerful than they are; still, I will grant you whatever you ask of me.
Ammon, being wise yet innocent, asked Lamoni: Will you listen to my words if I explain how I do these things? This is what I ask of you.
The king replied: Yes, I will believe all you say. And thus he was deceived.
Ammon began to speak to him boldly, asking: Do you believe there is a God?
The king replied: I don’t understand what that means.
Then Ammon asked: Do you believe there is a Great Spirit?
He said: Yes.
Ammon replied: This is God. He asked the king again: Do you believe that this Great Spirit, who is God, created everything in heaven and on earth?
The king said: Yes, I believe he created everything on the earth, but I don’t know about the heavens.
Ammon explained: The heavens is where God lives along with all his holy angels.
The king then asked: Is it above the earth?
Ammon affirmed: Yes, he looks down upon all people and knows all their thoughts and intentions; for he created them all from the beginning.
The king said: I believe everything you have said. Are you sent from God?
Ammon said: I am a man; and in the beginning, man was made in the image of God, and I have been called by his Holy Spirit to teach these truths to the people, so they can understand what is just and true;
And a part of that Spirit lives in me, giving me knowledge and strength according to my faith and desires in God.
Once Ammon finished speaking, he started from the creation of the world and Adam, explaining everything about the fall of man, sharing the records and holy scriptures that had been told by the prophets down to the time when Lehi left Jerusalem.
He also recounted to the king and his servants all the journeys of their ancestors through the wilderness, including their struggles with hunger and thirst, and their hardships.
He mentioned the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, recounting all their rebellions, explaining the records and scriptures from the time Lehi departed Jerusalem to the present day.
But that was not all; he explained the plan of redemption prepared from the beginning, and he also informed them about the coming of Christ, sharing all the Lord’s works with them.
After he explained all these things to the king, the king believed everything he said.
He began to cry out to the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to your great mercy towards the Nephites, show mercy to me and my people.
And as he finished saying this, he fell to the ground as if he were dead.
His servants then took him and carried him to his wife, laying him on a bed; he lay as if dead for two days and two nights, while his wife, sons, and daughters mourned for him, weeping deeply over his loss in the way of the Lamanites.
