Lamanite aggressions spread—The descendants of the priests of Noah perish as Abinadi predicted—Many Lamanites convert and join the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi—They believe in Christ and keep the law of Moses. About 90–77 B.C.
And so, at that time, the Lamanites were even angrier because they had killed some of their own; they vowed revenge on the Nephites and didn’t make any further attempts to attack the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi then.
Instead, they moved their armies into the outskirts of Zarahemla and attacked the people living in Ammonihah, destroying them.
After that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in which they were driven back and killed.
Most of the Lamanites who died were the descendants of Amulon and his brothers, the priests of Noah, who were killed by the Nephites.
Those who survived fled to the eastern wilderness and took control over the Lamanites, leading to many Lamanites dying by fire because of their beliefs.
After enduring significant loss and suffering, many began to recall the teachings that Aaron and his brothers had shared with them; they started to doubt the traditions passed down from their fathers and began to have faith in the Lord, recognizing the Nephites' great strength and thus many were converted in the wilderness.
The leaders who were left from Amulon’s family ordered the deaths of everyone who believed in these new teachings.
This killing made many of their fellow Lamanites very angry, leading to quarrels in the wilderness; they began hunting down the descendants of Amulon and killed them as they fled into the eastern wilderness.
Even now, they are still pursued by the Lamanites. Thus were the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he spoke about the descendants of the priests that led to his own death by fire.
He told them: What you do to me is a symbol of things to come.
Now Abinadi was the first to die by fire for his faith in God; this means that many would die in the same way he did.
He told the priests of Noah that their descendants would lead to many deaths like his, and that they would be scattered and killed like sheep without a shepherd that are hunted by wild animals; and now it has happened, for they were driven by the Lamanites, hunted, and attacked.
When the Lamanites realized they couldn’t defeat the Nephites, they returned to their own land; many came to live in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, joining the people of God, which were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
They also buried their weapons of war, just like their brethren had, and began to live righteously; they followed the ways of the Lord and upheld his commandments and statutes.
Yes, they kept the law of Moses because it was still necessary at that point, as it had not yet been fully completed. But even with the law of Moses, they looked forward to Christ’s coming, believing that the law of Moses was a representation of His arrival, and understanding they needed to continue performing its ordinances until He was revealed.
They did not think that salvation came through the law of Moses; instead, the law of Moses helped to strengthen their faith in Christ. Thus, they held onto hope through faith for eternal salvation, relying on the spirit of prophecy that spoke of future events.
And behold, Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, and their brothers were extremely joyful for their success among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had answered their prayers and fulfilled His promises to them in every way.
