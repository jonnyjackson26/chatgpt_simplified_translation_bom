Amalickiah becomes king of the Lamanites through deceit, murder, and cunning—The Nephite defectors are even more evil and fierce than the Lamanites. About 72 B.C.
Now let's go back to Amalickiah and those who had escaped with him into the wilderness. He took his followers and went into the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, stirring them up to become angry at the Nephites. Because of this, the king of the Lamanites declared a message throughout his land, urging his people to gather and prepare for battle against the Nephites.
When the message was received, the Lamanites were very frightened; they feared displeasing the king and also feared going into battle against the Nephites, worried for their lives. Most of them refused to follow the king’s commands.
The king was angry because they disobeyed him, so he put Amalickiah in charge of the part of his army that obeyed him and ordered Amalickiah to compel the others to fight.
This was exactly what Amalickiah wanted; being clever in his evil plans, he secretly decided to overthrow the king of the Lamanites.
He had gained control over the obedient portion of the Lamanites and sought to win the favor of the disobedient ones. So he went to a place called Onidah, where the Lamanites had fled, believing an army was coming to destroy them. 
They had chosen a man to be their king and leader, fully resolved not to submit to fighting against the Nephites.
They gathered on the top of a mountain named Antipas, getting ready for battle.
However, Amalickiah did not plan to fight them according to the king’s orders; instead, he intended to gain favor with the Lamanite armies, put himself in charge, dethrone the king, and take over the kingdom.
He had his army set up their tents in the valley near Mount Antipas.
Later that night, he sent a secret message to the leader on the mountain, named Lehonti, asking him to come down because he wanted to speak with him.
When Lehonti got the message, he was afraid to go down. Amalickiah sent a second message asking him to come down, but Lehonti still refused. Amalickiah sent a third message.
When Amalickiah realized he couldn't persuade Lehonti to come down, he climbed up closer to Lehonti's camp and sent a fourth message asking him to come down, this time requesting that he bring his guards.
When Lehonti came down with his guards, Amalickiah arranged for Lehonti and his army to come down at night and surround Amalickiah's men in their camps, promising to turn them over to Lehonti if he would make Amalickiah a second-in-command over the whole army.
Lehonti agreed, and when he surrounded Amalickiah's men, they found themselves trapped by Lehonti's forces before they woke up at dawn.
Seeing they were surrounded, Amalickiah's men begged him to allow them to join their fellow soldiers so they wouldn’t be destroyed. This was precisely what Amalickiah wanted.
He then gave his men to Lehonti, going against the king's orders, advancing his plot to dethrone the king.
It was customary among the Lamanites that if their leader was killed, the second-in-command would take over.
So Amalickiah secretly arranged for one of his servants to gradually poison Lehonti, which led to his death.
After Lehonti died, the Lamanites chose Amalickiah to be their leader and head commander.
Amalickiah then marched with his armies to the land of Nephi, entering the chief city there.
When the king came out to meet him with his guards, he believed Amalickiah had fulfilled his orders and gathered a mighty army against the Nephites.
But as the king approached, Amalickiah instructed his servants to go and meet him. They bowed before the king, pretending to show respect for his greatness.
When the king reached out to help them up, as was the Lamanite custom and a sign of peace, he lifted the first man when, suddenly, Amalickiah stabbed the king in the heart, and the king fell to the ground.
The king's servants fled, while Amalickiah's servants shouted:
Look, the king's servants have stabbed him, and he has fallen while they run away! Come and see!
Amalickiah ordered his troops to go and check what had happened to the king. When they arrived and saw the king lying in his blood, Amalickiah feigned anger, calling out: Whoever loved the king should chase after his servants to kill them!
Hearing this, those who cared for the king ran after his fleeing servants.
When the king’s servants noticed an army pursuing them, they became scared again and ran into the wilderness, crossing over into Zarahemla and joining the people of Ammon.
The pursuing army returned, realizing they had failed, and this allowed Amalickiah to win over the people through his trickery.
The next day, he entered the city of Nephi with his armies and took it over.
Afterward, the queen heard that the king had been murdered. Amalickiah had sent a message to her, claiming that the king had been killed by his own servants, and he had tried to pursue them but they escaped.
Upon receiving this news, the queen sent a message to Amalickiah asking him to spare the people of the city and inviting him to meet with her, also requesting that he bring witnesses to confirm the king’s death.
Amalickiah brought the same servant who had killed the king and others who were with him to the queen, and they all testified that the king had been killed by his own servants, adding that they had fled. This made the queen believe their story about the king's death.
Amalickiah then sought the queen’s favor and took her as his wife; through his deceit and with the help of his crafty followers, he became king, being recognized throughout the land by all the Lamanites, which included the Lamanites, Lemuelites, Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters from the Nephites since the time of Nephi.
These dissenters, who had received the same teachings and knowledge about the Lord as the Nephites, strangely became even more hardened and unrepentant, more wild, evil, and fierce than the Lamanites. They embraced the traditions of the Lamanites and surrendered to laziness and all forms of wicked behavior, completely forgetting the Lord their God.
