Alma and his sons began to share their teachings with the people, and Alma himself felt restless and joined them in their mission.
We won’t elaborate further on their preaching other than to say they spoke the truth through the spirit of prophecy, and they preached with divine authority as God had called them.
Now, I will return to tell about the conflicts that took place between the Nephites and the Lamanites during the eighteenth year of the judges’ rule.
At that time, the Zoramites switched sides and became Lamanites, so early in the eighteenth year, the Nephites realized that the Lamanites were approaching and started getting ready for battle, gathering their armies in the territory of Jershon.
The Lamanites arrived in large numbers, entering the area of Antionum, which belonged to the Zoramites, and they were led by a man named Zerahemnah.
Because the Amalekites had a stronger tendency toward wickedness and violence than the Lamanites, Zerahemnah appointed Amalekites and Zoramites as captains over the Lamanite forces.
He did this to keep their anger towards the Nephites alive and to control them to fulfill his own ambitions.
His plan was to incite the Lamanites to fight against the Nephites so that he could gain significant power over them and dominate the Nephites by enslaving them.
Meanwhile, the Nephites aimed to protect their land, homes, wives, and children from their enemies, ensuring their rights, freedoms, and ability to worship God as they wished.
They were aware that if they fell into the hands of the Lamanites, anyone who worshipped the true God would be at severe risk of being destroyed.
They also understood the Lamanites’ intense hatred for their brethren, the Anti-Nephi-Lehites, who were known as the people of Ammon—these people had made a vow not to take up arms—so if the Lamanites captured them, they would face inevitable destruction.
The Nephites would not allow that to happen, so they provided them with land to live on.
The people of Ammon gave the Nephites a large portion of their resources to support their military efforts, leaving the Nephites to confront the Lamanites by themselves, who were a mix of Laman and Lemuel, the sons of Ishmael, and those who had broken away from the Nephites, including Amalekites, Zoramites, and descendants of the priests of Noah.
The descendants of these groups were almost as numerous as the Nephites, forcing the Nephites to go into battle against their own kinsmen, resulting in great bloodshed.
As the Lamanite armies assembled in Antionum, the Nephite armies were ready to face them in Jershon.
The leader of the Nephites was Moroni, who was appointed to command all their forces.
Moroni took charge of the Nephite armies, and at only twenty-five years old, he led them into battle.
He encountered the Lamanites on the borders of Jershon, where his people were equipped with swords, curved swords, and all kinds of weapons.
When the Lamanites saw that Moroni had armed his troops with breastplates and shields, and they were also wearing heavy clothing—
The army led by Zerahemnah was not similarly equipped; they had only their swords, curved swords, bows, arrows, stones, and slings; most of them were practically naked, except for a loincloth; only the Zoramites and Amalekites had some clothing.
But they were not wearing breastplates or shields, which made them extremely fearful of the Nephite armies, despite their larger numbers.
Seeing this, they were too scared to approach the Nephites in Jershon; so they retreated into the wilderness, planning to go around by the head of the river Sidon to enter Manti and take possession of the land, mistakenly thinking that Moroni wouldn’t track them.
However, as soon as they left for the wilderness, Moroni sent scouts out to track their camp; knowing of Alma’s prophecies, he also sent messages to Alma, asking him to seek the Lord’s guidance on where the Nephite forces should go to defend against the Lamanites.
The Lord revealed to Alma that the Lamanites were trying to sneak around in the wilderness to strike at the weaker part of the Nephite population. Alma then communicated this message back to Moroni.
So Moroni left part of his troops in Jershon to prevent any Lamanites from taking over that city, while he took the rest of his forces to Manti.
He instructed all the people in that region to unite to fight against the Lamanites, to defend their land, homes, rights, and freedoms, preparing for the Lamanite attack.
He had his army hide in a valley near the river Sidon, on the western side, in the wilderness.
Moroni placed scouts around to keep an eye on the Lamanite camp.
Since he understood the Lamanites aimed to destroy their own people or enslave them to establish their own kingdom, he felt justified in using strategy to defend against them, so he learned from his scouts which path the Lamanites would take.
Moroni then split his army and positioned part of it in the valley, hiding them to the east and south of the hill Riplah;
And the remaining part he concealed in the western valley, to the west of the river Sidon, extending into the borders of Manti.
With his forces positioned as he had planned, he was ready for battle.
The Lamanites advanced toward the north of the hill where some of Moroni’s army was hidden.
As the Lamanites passed the hill Riplah and entered the valley, starting to cross the river Sidon, the hidden contingent led by Lehi surrounded them from the east.
The Lamanites, realizing they were ambushed from behind by the Nephites, turned to fight back against Lehi’s army.
Both sides began fighting fiercely, but the Lamanites suffered more because they were exposed and vulnerable to the Nephite’s swords, leading to many deaths.
On the other hand, while a few Nephites fell due to injury, most were protected by their armor and shields, allowing them to continue effectively battling the Lamanites.
As the Lamanites experienced great losses, they began to panic and started to retreat towards the river Sidon.
Lehi and his men chased them, driving them into the water of Sidon, while Lehi kept his forces on the riverbank to prevent any from escaping across.
Simultaneously, Moroni and his troops confronted the Lamanites in the valley across the river Sidon, striking them down.
The Lamanites fled again towards Manti, only to be met once more by Moroni’s army.
This time, the Lamanites fought with incredible ferocity; they had never fought with such strength before.
Their fighting spirit was fueled by the Zoramites and Amalekites, who were their leaders, especially Zerahemnah, who commanded them; they fought fiercely, and many Nephites fell before them, as they broke through some of their armor and wounded them.
Despite this, the Nephites were inspired by a nobler cause; they were fighting not for power but for their homes, freedoms, families, and their right to worship.
They believed it was their duty to defend themselves, as God had told them not to allow themselves to be victims as long as they had not been the aggressors.
God had also commanded them to defend their families, even risking their lives in the process. So, they fought to protect themselves, their families, and their religious beliefs.
When Moroni’s men witnessed the Lamanites’ fierce attack, they were tempted to withdraw in fear. But Moroni noticed their hesitation and motivated them by reminding them of their homes and freedom.
They rallied together, crying out to God for help in their fight for liberty.
Empowered by their plea to God for freedom, they began to stand firm against the Lamanites, and at that moment, the Lamanites began to flee, retreating towards the river Sidon.
Despite the Lamanites outnumbering the Nephites more than two to one, they were being pushed back and gathered into a single grouping in the valley near the river Sidon.
Thus, Moroni’s forces surrounded them on both sides of the river, with Lehi’s men positioned on the east side.
When Zerahemnah saw Lehi’s men on one side and Moroni’s on the other, he was filled with dread.
Seeing their fear, Moroni commanded his troops to halt the bloodshed.
