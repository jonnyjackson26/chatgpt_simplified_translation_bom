As Alma was traveling south from the land of Gideon toward the land of Manti, he was surprised to encounter the sons of Mosiah on their way to Zarahemla.
These sons of Mosiah had been with Alma when the angel first came to him; so Alma was extremely happy to see his brothers, and what made him even happier was that they were still his brothers in faith; indeed, they had grown strong in their understanding of the truth because they were diligent in studying the scriptures to learn God’s word.
But there’s more; they committed themselves to much prayer and fasting; as a result, they had the spirit of prophecy and revelation, and when they taught, they did so with God’s power and authority.
They had been sharing God’s word for fourteen years with the Lamanites, finding great success in leading many to the knowledge of the truth; by the power of their words, many were brought to God’s altar to call on His name and confess their sins.
These are the situations they encountered during their travels, as they faced many hardships; they suffered greatly, both physically and mentally, enduring hunger, thirst, exhaustion, and laboring hard in the spirit.
This summarizes their journeys: After parting from their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having declined the kingship their father wanted to give them, which was also the people’s desire;
Still, they left the land of Zarahemla, taking swords, spears, bows, arrows, and slings; they did this to provide food for themselves in the wilderness.
So they set out into the wilderness, with the group they had chosen, to go to the land of Nephi, to preach God’s word to the Lamanites.
They traveled many days in the wilderness, fasting and praying frequently that the Lord would give them part of His Spirit to accompany them, so they could be instruments in God's hands to help, if possible, their brothers, the Lamanites, understand the truth about the wrong beliefs rooted in their traditions.
Eventually, the Lord came to them with His Spirit, saying: Find comfort. And they were comforted.
The Lord also told them: Go among the Lamanites, your brothers, and spread my word; yet you need to be patient in enduring hardships so that you can provide a good example of me, and I will make you instruments in my hands for the salvation of many souls.
The hearts of the sons of Mosiah, along with those with them, were filled with courage to go forth to the Lamanites and proclaim God’s word.
When they reached the borders of the Lamanite land, they separated from one another, trusting in the Lord that they would reunite at the end of their mission; they believed that the work they had taken on was significant.
And indeed, it was significant, as they had committed to share God’s word with a wild, stubborn, and fierce people; a people who enjoyed killing Nephites, and stealing from and plundering them; their hearts were set on wealth, on gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to gain these riches through murder and theft, rather than by working for them.
Thus, they were a very lazy people, many of whom worshipped idols, and God's curse had come upon them due to their fathers' traditions; even so, the Lord’s promises were still offered to them if they would repent.
This was the reason the sons of Mosiah took on this mission, hoping to lead them to repentance; perhaps to bring them to understand the plan of redemption.
Therefore, they each went their separate ways to engage with them individually, empowered by the word and authority of God given to them.
Ammon, being in charge among them, blessed each of them according to their roles before departing; and thus, they began their journeys throughout the land.
Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, a place named after the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.
When Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites captured him and bound him, following their custom of capturing all Nephites they encountered and bringing them before the king; it was then up to the king to decide whether to kill them, keep them as prisoners, imprison them, or expel them from his land, based on his will.
So, Ammon was brought before the king of Ishmael, whose name was Lamoni, and he was a descendant of Ishmael.
The king asked Ammon if he wanted to live among the Lamanites or stay with his own people.
Ammon replied: Yes, I want to live among this people for a time; indeed, perhaps until the day I die.
When King Lamoni heard this, he was very pleased with Ammon and ordered that Ammon's bonds be removed; he offered Ammon one of his daughters as a wife.
But Ammon said: No, I will be your servant. Therefore, Ammon became a servant to King Lamoni, and it turned out that he was assigned alongside other servants to tend to Lamoni's flocks, as was customary for the Lamanites.
After he had been serving the king for three days, while he was with the Lamanite servants leading their flocks to the water, which was called the water of Sebus, where all the Lamanites brought their flocks to drink—
As Ammon and the king’s servants were bringing their flocks to this water, some Lamanites who had just watered their flocks scattered Ammon's and the king's flocks, causing them to flee in every direction.
The king's servants began to complain, saying: The king will surely kill us, just like he has our brothers, because our flocks have been scattered by the actions of these wicked men. They began to cry out in distress, saying: Look, our flocks are already scattered!
They were crying out in fear of being killed. When Ammon saw this, his heart filled with joy; for he thought, I will demonstrate my strength to these fellow servants by restoring the flocks to the king, hoping to gain their trust so they may believe my words.
These were the thoughts of Ammon as he witnessed the suffering of those he considered his brothers.
He encouraged them with his words, saying: My brothers, cheer up! Let’s go search for the flocks, and we will gather them together and return them to the watering place; this way, we will save the flocks for the king, and he won’t harm us.
So they followed Ammon to search for the flocks, rushing forward with great speed and successfully rounding up the king's sheep back to the water.
Those men again tried to scatter the flocks; but Ammon instructed his comrades: Surround the flocks so they don’t escape; I will go and confront those who scatter our flocks.
They obeyed Ammon’s instruction, and he stepped forward to confront those by the waters of Sebus; and there were many of them.
They did not fear Ammon, believing that one of their own could easily defeat him because they did not understand that the Lord had promised Mosiah He would protect his sons; they also knew nothing about the Lord’s power; thus, they took pleasure in attacking their brothers, which is why they tried to scatter the king's flocks.
But Ammon stood firm and began to throw stones at them with his sling; yes, he skillfully hurled stones among them, and he killed several of them, causing them to be astonished at his strength; yet they were furious about the deaths of their companions and were determined to kill him; therefore, when they found they could not hit him with stones, they charged him with clubs intending to kill him.
However, every man who tried to hit Ammon with a club was met with swift action from Ammon, who cut off their arms with his sword; he defended himself by deflecting their blows and cutting off their arms, which astonished them, causing them to run away from him; he made many of them flee by his strength.
Six of them fell from the stones, and he did not kill anyone except their leader with his sword; he cut off as many arms as he could that were raised against him, and they were not few.
After driving them away, he returned to water the flocks and took them back to the king’s pasture, then went to see the king, carrying in the severed arms of those who had tried to kill him, as proof of their actions against him.
