Not long after Moroni wrote a letter to the chief governor, he received a response from Pahoran, the chief governor. Here’s what it said:
I, Pahoran, the chief governor of this land, write to you, Moroni, the leader of the army. I want you to know that I don’t take pleasure in your suffering; it deeply saddens me.
However, some people take joy in your hardships to the point that they have rebelled against me and the free citizens of my nation. These rebels are very numerous.
Those who are trying to take away my position have caused this major wrongdoing; they have used flattery and misled many people, which has led to serious troubles for us. They have withheld supplies from us and intimidated our free citizens, preventing them from coming to your aid.
Because of this, I was forced to flee, finding refuge in the land of Gideon with as many supporters as I could gather.
I have sent out a call for help across this region, and people are joining us daily to defend our country and protect our freedoms, seeking to right the wrongs done to us.
They have gathered with us to such an extent that the rebels now fear us and do not dare to confront us in battle.
The rebels have taken over the city of Zarahemla, appointed a king for themselves, and that king has written to the king of the Lamanites to form an alliance. He believes this alliance will help them maintain control of Zarahemla and ultimately allow the Lamanites to conquer the rest of the land. He expects that he will be made king over the people after they are defeated.
In your letter, you criticized me, but it doesn’t upset me; instead, I admire your strong spirit. I, Pahoran, am not seeking power for myself, but simply to keep my position to protect the rights and freedoms of my people. I firmly hold onto the liberty that God has granted us.
Now, we will fight against wickedness even if it leads to bloodshed. We would prefer not to shed Lamanite blood if they would simply remain in their own territory.
We do not wish to harm our fellow countrymen if they choose not to rebel against us.
We would endure being in bondage if it were just according to God’s will, or if He commanded us to do so.
But God does not tell us to submit to our enemies; instead, He instructs us to trust in Him, and He will save us.
So, dear brother Moroni, let’s stand against evil. For those things we cannot oppose with words, like rebellion and division, let’s resist using our swords, so we can keep our freedom and take joy in the blessings of our faith and our God.
Therefore, come to me quickly with a few of your men, and leave the rest under the command of Lehi and Teancum. Empower them to lead the fight in that part of the land according to God’s spirit, which is also the spirit of freedom within them.
I have sent some supplies to them to ensure they do not starve until you can reach me.
Gather whatever forces you can for your journey here, and we will swiftly confront those rebels with God’s strength and our faith.
We will reclaim the city of Zarahemla to secure more food for Lehi and Teancum. With the Lord’s help, we will put an end to this serious wrongdoing.
Moroni, I am glad to receive your letter because I was becoming concerned about whether it was right for us to go against our fellow countrymen.
You mentioned that unless they repent, the Lord has told you to fight against them.
Make sure to build up Lehi and Teancum in their faith; assure them not to be afraid, as God will deliver them and all who stand firm in the liberty He has given them. I now end my letter to you, my dear brother Moroni.
