At the beginning of the thirty-sixth year of the judges' rule over the Nephite people, Shiblon received the sacred records that had been given to Helaman by Alma.
He was a good and honest man who lived righteously before God, consistently doing good and following the Lord’s commandments, just like his brother did.
Moroni also passed away during this time, marking the end of the thirty-sixth year of the judges' reign.
In the thirty-seventh year of the judges' rule, a large group of 5,400 men, along with their wives and children, left the land of Zarahemla and traveled northward.
A curious man named Hagoth built a very large ship along the border of the land Bountiful, near the land Desolation, and sent it out into the west sea through the narrow neck that led northward.
Many Nephites boarded the ship, sailing away with plenty of supplies, including many women and children, continuing their journey northward. This marked the end of the thirty-seventh year.
In the thirty-eighth year, Hagoth constructed more ships. The first ship returned, with more people boarding it, taking additional provisions, and setting out once again to the north.
Sadly, those on board were never heard from again, possibly lost in the depths of the ocean. Another ship also sailed, but we do not know where it went.
During this year, many people continued to travel northward. Thus, the thirty-eighth year came to an end.
In the thirty-ninth year of the judges' rule, Shiblon also passed away, and Corianton had gone northward in a ship to deliver supplies to those who had settled there.
Before his death, Shiblon felt it was necessary to pass on the sacred records to Helaman, the son of Helaman, named after his father.
All the records in Helaman’s possession were shared among the people, except for those specific instructions given by Alma that were not to be distributed.
These sacred records were meant to be preserved and passed down through generations, so they were entrusted to Helaman before Shiblon died.
In that same year, some dissenters went among the Lamanites, reigniting their anger against the Nephites.
Also during that year, they came down in large numbers to wage war against Moronihah’s army but were defeated and pushed back to their own lands, suffering significant losses.
This brings us to the end of the thirty-ninth year of the judges’ rule over the Nephite people.
This concludes the account of Alma, his son Helaman, and Shiblon, who was also his son.
