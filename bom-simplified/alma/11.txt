The law of Mosiah stated that every judge should be paid for the time they worked judging others.
If someone owed money to another person and refused to pay, they could be taken to the judge. The judge would call for officers to ensure the person appeared before him, and would then make a determination based on the law and evidence presented. The debtor would be forced to pay what they owed, face punishment, or be cast out as a thief.
Judges were paid based on their time—one gold senine for a day, or one silver senum, which holds the same value. This was established by the law.
The Nephites had their own names for gold and silver coins based on their value, and they didn’t measure wealth like the Jews in Jerusalem. They adapted their system according to what made sense for their people from one generation to the next, lasting until the judges were established by King Mosiah.
The small denominations included a gold senine, seon, shum, and limnah.
For silver, there were the senum, amnor, ezrom, and onti.
A silver senum was worth one gold senine, equivalent to a measure of barley or other types of grain.
A seon of gold was worth twice as much as a senine.
A shum of gold was worth twice a seon.
A limnah of gold was the highest value of them all.
An amnor of silver was worth two senums.
An ezrom of silver was worth four senums.
An onti was the most valuable of them all.
The smaller units were as follows:
A shiblon was half a senum, which would equal half a measure of barley.
A shiblum was half a shiblon.
A leah was half a shiblum.
These were the denominations according to their system.
An antion of gold was equivalent to three shiblons.
Their aim was to profit from their positions, so they incited the public to riots and disturbances to increase their workloads and earn more money from the cases they oversaw. Thus, they turned the people against Alma and Amulek.
Zeezrom questioned Amulek, asking if he could answer a few of his questions. Zeezrom was skilled in deceit and wanted to undermine goodness, and he urged Amulek to answer him.
Amulek replied, “Yes, as long as it aligns with the Spirit of the Lord within me; I won’t say anything against His Spirit.” Zeezrom then offered Amulek six onties of silver if he would deny the existence of God.
Amulek responded, “Oh, child of hell, why are you tempting me? Don’t you know that the righteous do not give in to such temptations?
Do you believe there is no God? I tell you, no; you know there is a God, but you love money more than Him.
And now, you have lied to God in front of me. You showed me the six onties, which you considered valuable, and wanted me to deny the living God just so you could find a reason to destroy me. Now, for this great evil, you will receive your punishment.
Zeezrom questioned, “So you assert there is a true and living God?”
Amulek confirmed, “Yes, there is a true and living God.”
Zeezrom asked, “Is there more than one God?”
Amulek answered, “No.”
Zeezrom pressed further, “How do you know these things?”
Amulek said, “An angel has revealed them to me.”
Then Zeezrom asked again, “Who is the one who will come? Is it the Son of God?”
Amulek replied, “Yes.”
Zeezrom continued, “Will He save His people despite their sins?” Amulek replied, “I tell you, He will not, for He cannot go against His own word.”
Zeezrom then told the people, “Remember what he said; he claims there’s only one God, yet he says the Son of God will come but won’t save His people,” as if he has the right to question God.
Amulek affirmed, “You’ve lied; you say I act like I have the authority to command God because I said He cannot save His people in their sins.
I repeat, He cannot save them in their sins; I cannot deny His word, which states that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven. So how can you be saved unless you enter the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, you cannot be saved while remaining in your sins.
Zeezrom asked again, “Is the Son of God the Eternal Father?”
Amulek replied, “Yes, He is the Eternal Father of heaven and earth and everything in them; He is the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
He will come into the world to redeem His people and bears the transgressions of those who believe in Him; they will receive eternal life, and salvation comes to no one else.
So, the wicked will remain as if no redemption was made except for the release from physical death; because the day will come when everyone will rise from the dead and stand before God, being judged based on their actions.
There is a death called temporal death; the death of Christ will release everyone from this temporal death, allowing them to be raised from it.
The spirit and body will be rejoined perfectly; every part will be restored to its original state, just like we are now; and we will stand before God, aware of everything we have done and remembering our wrongdoings.
Restoration will come for all, for the young and the old, the enslaved and the free, men and women, both the wicked and the righteous; not even a single hair on their heads will be lost; everything will be perfectly restored to how it was before, and they will present themselves before Christ, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit—one eternal God—to be judged on their deeds, whether good or bad.
I have discussed the death of the mortal body and the resurrection of the mortal body. I tell you that this mortal body will be raised to an immortal body, meaning from death, transitioning from the first death to life, so they can die no more; their spirits will unite with their bodies, never to be separated; this transformation will make them spiritual and immortal, free from corruption.
When Amulek finished speaking, the people were once more astonished, and Zeezrom began to tremble. This concluded Amulek's words, which is all I have recorded.
