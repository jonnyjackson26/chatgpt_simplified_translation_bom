After two days and two nights, they were preparing to take his body and put it in a tomb they had made for burying the dead.
The queen, having heard about Ammon's reputation, sent for him to come to her.
Ammon obeyed her request and went to see the queen, wanting to know what she wanted him to do.
She told him that her husband’s servants had informed her that he was a prophet of a holy God and that he had the power to perform many mighty things in God's name.
So, if this were true, she asked him to go see her husband, who had been lying in bed for two days and two nights; some said he was dead, but others insisted he was alive, and she believed he was still living.
Ammon was eager to help because he knew that King Lamoni was under God's influence; he sensed that the darkness of doubt was leaving his mind and the light of God's glory was filling him with joy—this light had pushed away the darkness, filling him with a wonderful happiness, and he felt that everlasting life was brightening his soul; he knew this change had taken over his very being.
The queen's request aligned with Ammon's desires, so he went to see the king as she had asked and realized that the king was indeed alive.
He told the queen that her husband was not dead, but was simply resting in God, and that he would awaken the next day, so there was no need to bury him.
Ammon then asked her if she believed this, and she replied that she hadn't seen any proof other than his word and the word of the servants; still, she believed it would happen just as he had said.
Ammon responded by telling her that she was blessed for her strong faith and that he hadn’t seen such great faith among the Nephites.
From that moment until the next day, the queen kept watch by her husband's bedside.
When the next day came, her husband rose, just as Ammon had predicted. As he stood up, he reached his hand out to the woman and said, "Blessed be the name of God, and you are blessed too."
He declared that he had seen his Redeemer and that he would come into the world, born of a woman, to save everyone who believes in his name. After saying this, he felt an overwhelming joy and fell back down, and the queen also collapsed, filled with the Spirit.
Ammon saw the Lord's Spirit being poured out in response to his prayers for the Lamanites, who had caused much sorrow to the Nephites due to their wrongdoing and traditions. Filled with gratitude and joy, he knelt down to pray and thank God, and together with the king and queen, they all fell to the ground.
When the king's servants witnessed the scene, they too cried out to God, gripped by fear, as they had previously testified to the king about Ammon's great power.
So they called on the Lord with all their strength until they too fell to the ground, except for one Lamanite woman named Abish, who had been a believer in the Lord for many years due to an incredible vision she had of her father.
Having been a secret believer, when she saw everyone, including the servants, the queen, the king, and Ammon, lying on the ground, she realized it was the power of God at work. Thinking that sharing this event would help people believe in God's power, she rushed from house to house to tell everyone what had happened.
As people gathered at the king's house, they were astonished to see the king, queen, and servants all lying on the ground as if dead, along with Ammon, who was a Nephite.
The crowd began to argue among themselves, with some claiming a great disaster had befallen them because the king let a Nephite stay in their land.
Others blamed the king, arguing that he had brought this trouble upon his household after he had killed the servants who had scattered his flocks by the waters of Sebus.
Those angry with Ammon for killing their companions at the waters of Sebus also criticized the king for his actions.
One man, whose brother Ammon had killed, was furious and tried to attack Ammon with a sword, but as he raised it to strike, he suddenly fell down dead.
It was clear that Ammon could not be harmed, for the Lord had told his father, Mosiah, that he would protect him according to Mosiah’s faith, and thus Mosiah had entrusted him to the Lord.
When the crowd saw the man who had tried to kill Ammon lying dead, they were all frightened and dared not touch him or anyone else who had fallen, marveling at the source of this great power and what it all meant.
Many started to claim that Ammon was a powerful spirit, and others thought he was sent by such a spirit;
But some argued that he was a monster sent by the Nephites to torment them.
Some believed that Ammon was sent to punish them for their wrongdoings and that it was the great spirit who protected the Nephites and helped them defeat many Lamanites.
This led to heated arguments among them, and while they debated, Abish, the servant who had gathered the crowd, saw the arguing and became very sad, even to tears.
She rushed over to the queen, took her hand, and hoped to help her stand; when she touched the queen's hand, she immediately rose and cried out loudly, glorifying Jesus and asking for mercy for the people.
After saying this, she joyfully clasped her hands and spoke many words that were hard to understand. Then she took King Lamoni's hand, and he too stood up.
Seeing the fighting among his people, he went to address them and teach them what he had learned from Ammon's words; those who listened were convinced and turned to the Lord.
However, there were many who refused to listen, so they simply walked away.
When Ammon got up, he ministered to them as did all of Lamoni's servants, telling the people the same thing—that their hearts had changed, and they no longer wanted to do evil.
Many proclaimed that they had seen angels and spoken with them, sharing divine revelations and teachings.
As a result, many believed their words; those who believed were baptized, becoming a righteous community and establishing a church among themselves.
Thus, the Lord's work began among the Lamanites; the Lord's Spirit was poured out upon them, showing that his reach is extended to everyone who repents and believes in his name.
