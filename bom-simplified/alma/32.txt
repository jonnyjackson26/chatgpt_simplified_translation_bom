They went out and started telling people about God, preaching in their synagogues, homes, and even on the streets.
After working hard among the people, they began to see progress, especially with the poor; they had been rejected from the synagogues because their clothes were shabby.
Because of that, they weren't allowed to worship in the synagogues and were considered worthless by others; as a result, they were materially poor and also felt downtrodden in spirit.
While Alma was teaching the people on the hill Onidah, a large group came to him, which included those who were suffering and felt poor in spirit due to their lack of worldly goods.
One of them, who was leading the group, approached Alma and asked: "What should we do? Everyone looks down on us because we're poor, especially the priests; they've kicked us out of the synagogues we worked hard to build ourselves. Now we have nowhere to worship God; what can we do?"
When Alma heard this, he turned to the man with joy because he could see that their hardships had truly made them humble and ready to listen to the teachings.
So he didn’t address the rest of the crowd, but reached out to those who were genuinely repentant and said to them:
"I see that you are humble in heart; if that’s the case, you are blessed.
Your brother asked what to do, since we are rejected from our synagogues and cannot worship God.
Do you think you can only worship God in your synagogues?
And do you think you only need to worship God once a week?
I tell you, being cast out of your synagogues is good for you, as it teaches you humility and wisdom; you need to learn wisdom, and your experiences of rejection due to your poverty have made you humble.
Because you have been forced to be humble, you are blessed; sometimes when a person is forced to be humble, they seek repentance, and anyone who does repent will find mercy. Whoever finds mercy and perseveres to the end will be saved.
As I said, it is a blessing to be made humble; don’t you think those who truly choose to be humble because of the teachings are even more blessed?
Yes, the person who humbles themselves willingly, repents of their sins, and perseveres will be more blessed than those who are only humble because of their poverty.
So, blessed are those who choose to be humble rather than being forced to be; blessed is anyone who believes in God’s word and is baptized without being stubborn or waiting for proof before they believe.
Some say, "If you show us a sign from heaven, we will know for sure and then we will believe."
But I ask you, is that faith? I say no, because if a person already knows something, they have no need for faith.
And how much worse is it for someone who knows God's will and ignores it than for someone who only believes based on lack of evidence and then sins?
Now you must consider this. I tell you, it is the same both ways, and every person will be judged based on their actions.
And as I mentioned about faith—faith is not knowing everything perfectly; so if you have faith, you hope for things that are not seen but are true.
And remember, God is merciful to everyone who believes in his name; he first wants you to believe in his word.
He shares his word through angels with everyone, including men, women, and sometimes even children, which can leave the wise and learned confused.
Now, my dear friends, since you want to know what to do because you’re struggling and feeling cast out, I don’t mean to judge you harshly.
I’m not saying that you all were forced into humility; I truly believe that some of you would choose to humble yourselves no matter the situation.
As I mentioned that faith is not perfect knowledge, the same applies to my words. You won't have perfect certainty about them right away, just as faith isn’t perfect knowledge.
But if you awaken your mind and put my words to the test, and even if all you can do is wish to believe, let that wish develop into a belief strong enough to allow my words to take root in you.
Now, let’s think of the word as a seed. If you let a good seed be planted in your heart and don’t reject it with skepticism, it will start to grow inside you. When you notice this growth, you will realize that it might be a good seed or a good word because it opens your soul, enlightens your mind, and tastes sweet to you.
Wouldn’t this boost your faith? I say yes, but it might not lead to perfect knowledge.
As the seed grows and sprouts, you will have to admit that the seed is good; because it grows and flourishes. Will this strengthen your faith? Yes, it will, as you will know that this is indeed a good seed since it sprouts and grows.
Are you sure this seed is good? I say yes, because every seed produces after its own kind.
So, if a seed grows, it's a good one, but if it doesn't grow, then it isn't good and is discarded.
Now, if you have tried planting the seed and it has started to swell, sprout, and grow, you must recognize that it is a good seed.
Is your knowledge perfect now? Yes, in this matter your understanding is complete, and your faith may feel inactive; and that’s because you know, since the word has filled your soul and enlightened your mind.
So, is this a real experience? Yes, it is light, and anything that is light is good because it helps you understand what is good. After experiencing this light, is your knowledge perfect?
I say no; you mustn’t abandon your faith, for you have just exercised faith to plant the seed to test if it is good.
As the tree begins to grow, you will say: "Let’s take care of it, so it roots well, grows strong, and produces fruit for us." If you nurture it well, it will take root and grow to bear fruit.
But if you neglect the tree and don’t care for it, it will not take root; and when the sun comes out, it will wither away because it has no roots, and you will pull it up and discard it.
This isn’t because the seed was bad or the fruit wouldn’t be good; it’s because you’ve neglected to nurture it, so you miss out on the fruit.
Thus, if you won’t nourish the word, looking forward with faith to its fruit, you can never enjoy the fruit from the tree of life.
However, if you nurture the word and take care of it as it grows, with faith and patience while hoping for the fruit, it will take root; and it will become a tree that leads to everlasting life.
Because of your diligence, faith, and patience while nourishing it, eventually you will enjoy its precious fruit—sweeter than anything else, purer than anything else—and you will feast on it until you have no hunger or thirst.
Then, my friends, you will reap the rewards of your faith, diligence, patience, and endurance as you wait for the tree to bear its fruit for you.
