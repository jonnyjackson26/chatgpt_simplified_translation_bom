In the beginning of the twenty-fifth year of the judges ruling over the Nephites, they had established peace between the people of Lehi and Morianton concerning their lands, and started the year peacefully. 
However, this peace did not last long, as disagreements arose among the people regarding Chief Judge Pahoran; some wanted certain aspects of the law changed.
But Pahoran stood firm and refused to change the law, so he ignored those who submitted their requests for those changes. 
As a result, those wanting Pahoran replaced were angry with him and wanted him out of his position; this led to heated debates, but there was no violence.
Those wanting to remove Pahoran from the judgeship were known as king-men because they wanted to change the law to eliminate the free government and place a king in power.
On the other hand, those wanting Pahoran to stay in power called themselves freemen, and thus the division began. The freemen committed to uphold their rights and freedoms through a government that allowed for liberty.
This dispute was ultimately resolved by the people's vote. The vote favored the freemen, allowing Pahoran to keep his position, leading to great relief among Pahoran's supporters and many liberty-loving people, who silenced the king-men, forcing them to support freedom.
The pro-king faction consisted of nobles seeking power, and they received support from those desiring control over the population.
However, this was a critical time for such disputes within the Nephite community; for Amalickiah had once more stirred up the Lamanites against them and was gathering soldiers from all around his land, preparing for war, vowing revenge against Moroni.
Despite his reckless promise, he did organize himself and his armies for battle against the Nephites.
His armies weren't as large as before due to the many he lost to Nephite warriors, yet Amalickiah still managed to gather a large force, enough to fearlessly approach the land of Zarahemla.
Yes, even Amalickiah himself came down leading the Lamanites during the twenty-fifth year of the judges’ reign; it was at this time that the disputes over Chief Judge Pahoran were being settled.
When the king-men heard about the Lamanite invasion, they were pleased and refused to take up arms, filled with rage against Pahoran and the liberty supporters, unwilling to defend their country.
Seeing this, Moroni was extremely angry at the stubbornness of those he had worked tirelessly to protect; he was outraged, feeling betrayed.
So, he sent a request, backed by the people's voice, to the governor of the land, asking for authority to make those dissenters defend their country or face death. 
His top priority was to resolve the fighting and disagreements among the people, as they had caused much of their troubles. This request was agreed upon as per the people's vote.
Moroni commanded his army to confront the king-men, to strip away their arrogance and authority, either to fight for freedom or face consequences.
The armies marched against the king-men; they brought down their pride, and as the king-men attacked Moroni's warriors, they were defeated and fell to the ground.
A total of four thousand dissenters were killed in battle, and their leaders who survived were imprisoned, as there wasn't time for trials during this urgent period.
Those who remained chose to fight for their country rather than face death, agreeing to raise the banner of liberty in their cities and take up arms in defense.
Thus, Moroni eliminated the king-men; there was no longer anyone identified by that title, and he humbled those who had claimed noble lineage, urging them to join their fellow citizens in defending their freedom.
While Moroni was working to quell conflicts and bring his people to peace while preparing for war against the Lamanites, the Lamanites invaded the land of Moroni, close to the coast.
The Nephites were not strong enough in the city of Moroni, and Amalickiah managed to overpower them, killing many and taking control of the city and its defenses.
Those who fled from Moroni found refuge in Nephihah, and the people of Lehi also gathered to prepare for battle against the Lamanites.
However, Amalickiah did not allow the Lamanites to attack Nephihah but kept them along the coast while leaving soldiers in every city to protect them.
He continued taking over many cities, including Nephihah, Lehi, Morianton, Omner, Gid, and Mulek, all located along the eastern coast.
Thanks to Amalickiah's cunning, the Lamanites gained many cities, all well-fortified like those of Moroni, providing strongholds for them.
They marched toward the borders of Bountiful, pushing the Nephites back and killing many.
Fortunately, they were confronted by Teancum, who had already slain Morianton and was leading his people as they fled.
Teancum also intercepted Amalickiah as he advanced with his large army, aiming to seize Bountiful and the northern lands.
However, Teancum and his men successfully repulsed Amalickiah, as they were stronger and more skilled fighters, gaining the upper hand.
They pressed hard against the Lamanites, fighting them until nightfall. Teancum and his warriors pitched their tents in Bountiful while Amalickiah settled his troops near the beach.
When night fell, Teancum and his servant secretly entered Amalickiah’s camp, where the soldiers had fallen asleep from exhaustion due to the day's heat and battles.
Teancum quietly slipped into the king’s tent and stabbed him with a javelin, killing him without waking his servants.
He then returned quietly to his own camp and found his men asleep. He woke them up and recounted what had occurred.
He organized his soldiers to be ready in case the Lamanites had awoken and would launch an attack.
And thus the twenty-fifth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites concluded, marking the end of Amalickiah's days.
