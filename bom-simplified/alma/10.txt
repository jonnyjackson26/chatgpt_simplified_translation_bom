Now these are the words that Amulek preached to the people living in Ammonihah:
I am Amulek; my father was Giddonah, who was a son of Ishmael, a descendant of Aminadi, and it was Aminadi who interpreted the writing on the temple wall that was written by God's hand.
Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, the son of Lehi, who left Jerusalem, a descendant of Manasseh, the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by his brothers.
And look, I have a good reputation among everyone who knows me; indeed, I have many relatives and friends, and I have gained considerable wealth through my hard work.
Yet, despite all of this, I never really understood the ways of the Lord or his mysteries and incredible power. I thought I had not known much about these things; however, I was wrong, because I have seen a lot of his mysteries and his incredible power, especially in saving the lives of these people.
Still, I hardened my heart, because I had been called many times but did not listen; I knew about these things, but refused to understand them; as a result, I continued to rebel against God, in the wickedness of my heart, until the fourth day of the seventh month in the tenth year of the judges' reign.
While I was traveling to see a close relative, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to me and said: Amulek, go back home, because you will feed a prophet of the Lord; yes, a holy man, chosen by God; because he has fasted many days for the sins of this people, and he is hungry, and you will invite him into your home and feed him, and he will bless you and your household; and the Lord's blessing will be upon you and your family.
And I obeyed the angel and returned home. While going there, I encountered the man the angel told me to welcome into my home—and it was the same man who has been talking to you about the things of God.
And the angel told me that he is a holy man; therefore, I know he is holy because an angel of God said so.
Again, I know that what he has testified about is true; for I assure you, as the Lord lives, he has sent his angel to reveal these things to me; and this has happened while Alma was living in my house.
For indeed, he has blessed my home, he has blessed me, my wives, my children, my father, and my relatives; yes, he has blessed all my family, and the blessing of the Lord has been upon us according to what he said.
And now, after Amulek spoke these words, the people were amazed, seeing that more than one person testified about what they were accused of, and also about future events according to the spirit of prophecy within them.
However, some among them wished to question them cunningly so they could trap them in their words, to find evidence against them, to send them to their judges to be judged according to the law, and to have them killed or imprisoned based on whatever crimes they could fabricate against them.
These men who sought to destroy them were lawyers, hired or appointed by the people to enforce the law during trials of crimes committed by the people in front of the judges.
These lawyers were educated in various arts and deceptions of the people; this was to ensure they were skilled in their profession.
And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, hoping to catch him contradicting himself.
However, they did not realize that Amulek was aware of their schemes. As they questioned him, he sensed their thoughts, and he said to them: O you wicked and dishonest generation, you lawyers and hypocrites, you are laying the groundwork for the devil, creating traps and snares to catch God's holy ones.
You are trying to distort the paths of the righteous and bring God's wrath upon yourselves, leading to the total destruction of this people.
Yes, Mosiah, our last king, wisely said when he was about to hand over the kingdom, having no one to pass it to, that the people should govern themselves—he said that if the time came when the voice of the people chose sin, meaning if they fell into wrongdoing, they would be ready for destruction.
And now I tell you that the Lord is well aware of your wrongdoings; he calls out to this people, through his angels: Repent, repent, for heaven’s kingdom is near.
Yes, he proclaims through his angels that: I will come among my people, bringing fairness and justice.
And I tell you that without the prayers of the righteous who are in the land, you would quickly face complete destruction; but it would not be by a flood like in Noah’s time, but by famine, disease, and war.
It is because of the prayers of the righteous that you are being spared; however, if you expel the righteous from among you, then the Lord will not hold back his hand; in his fierce anger, he will come against you, and you will face famine, disease, and war; the time is coming soon unless you repent.
Now it happened that the people became angrier with Amulek, shouting: This man speaks against our just laws and the wise lawyers we have chosen.
But Amulek raised his hand and cried out even louder, saying: O you wicked and perverse generation, how has Satan taken such strong control over your hearts? Why do you surrender yourselves to him so he can blind your eyes, preventing you from understanding the truth of the words spoken to you?
Look, have I spoken against your law? You don't understand; you claim I have spoken against your law, but I haven't; I have only spoken in favor of your law, which condemns you.
Now I declare to you that the foundation of this people's destruction is starting to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and judges.
And when Amulek finished speaking, the people shouted against him, saying: Now we know this man is a child of the devil, because he has lied to us; he has spoken against our law. And now he says he has not spoken against it.
And again, he has insulted our lawyers and judges.
Then the lawyers decided to remember these things against him.
Among them was one named Zeezrom. He was the first to accuse Amulek and Alma, being one of the most skilled among them, often dealing with the people.
The goal of these lawyers was to profit; and they earned their gain through their work.
