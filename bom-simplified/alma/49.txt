In the eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day, the armies of the Lamanites were seen coming toward the land of Ammonihah.
The city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had placed an army at the city’s borders, with a dirt fortification around them to protect against the Lamanites' arrows and stones.
Indeed, while the city of Ammonihah had been partially rebuilt, the Lamanites wrongly believed they could easily conquer it again, having previously destroyed it due to the people's sins.
However, they were greatly disappointed, for the Nephites had built a high earth embankment around themselves, making it impossible for the Lamanites to effectively use their stones and arrows against them, except at their entrance.
At this time, the chief Lamanite leaders were extremely surprised by the Nephites' clever defenses.
The Lamanite leaders had believed that because of their large numbers, they could easily attack as they had before; they had also equipped themselves with shields, breastplates, and thick skin garments to cover themselves.
With this preparation, they thought they would easily overpower the Nephites or slay them at will.
But to their absolute surprise, the Nephites were ready for them in ways never seen among the descendants of Lehi, prepared for battle according to Moroni's strategies.
The Lamanites, or followers of Amalickiah, were greatly shocked by how well the Nephites were prepared for war.
If King Amalickiah had led his army personally from the land of Nephi, he might have made the Lamanites attack the Nephites at Ammonihah, as he cared little for his people’s lives.
However, Amalickiah did not personally go to battle, and his chief captains were afraid to engage the Nephites at Ammonihah, as Moroni had changed the way the Nephites organized themselves, which left the Lamanites unable to find safe retreats.
So, they retreated into the wilderness, and moved toward the land of Noah, thinking that would be a good next place to confront the Nephites.
They didn’t know that Moroni had built strong defenses in every city surrounding them; thus, they marched towards Noah with firm resolve and took an oath to destroy its inhabitants.
Yet, they were stunned to find that the city of Noah, previously weak, had become strong under Moroni’s leadership, even stronger than Ammonihah.
Moroni had wisely anticipated that the Lamanites would be intimidated by Ammonihah, and since Noah had been the weakest location, they would attack there, which worked out just as he hoped.
Moroni had appointed Lehi as the chief captain over the men of that city; this was the same Lehi who had fought against the Lamanites in the valley east of the river Sidon.
When the Lamanites learned that Lehi was in charge, they were again disappointed because they feared him greatly; nonetheless, their leaders were bound by their oaths to attack, so they gathered their forces.
The Lamanites could not enter the Nephites' fortifications except through the main entrance, due to the height of the earth embankment and the depth of the surrounding ditch.
The Nephites were positioned to defeat anyone attempting to climb into their fort through any other means by throwing stones and arrows at them.
Thus, they were prepared: a group of their strongest men, armed with swords and slings, stood ready to strike down anyone trying to enter through the main entrance, prepared to defend against the Lamanites.
The captains of the Lamanites assembled their armies at the entrance and began fighting against the Nephites to breach their defenses, but they were continually pushed back and suffered tremendous losses.
When they realized they couldn’t overpower the Nephites at the entrance, they began digging down the earth banks to create a passage for their armies to fair off equally, but they were met with stones and arrows thrown at them; instead of successfully filling in their ditches, they became filled with their slain and wounded.
In this way, the Nephites maintained power over their enemies; the Lamanites continued to try to defeat the Nephites until all their chief captains were killed, with over a thousand Lamanites dead, while not a single Nephite was lost.
About fifty Nephites were wounded by Lamanite arrows through the pass, but they were protected by their armor, so many of their injuries were on their legs and quite severe.
When the Lamanites saw that all their chiefs had been killed, they fled into the wilderness and returned to the land of Nephi to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was originally a Nephite, about their great losses.
He became extremely angry with his people for not being able to defeat the Nephites and subject them to slavery.
He was filled with rage, cursed God and Moroni, swearing that he would make Moroni pay with his blood, all because Moroni had followed God’s commandments and protected his people.
On the other hand, the Nephites expressed gratitude to the Lord their God for His unmatched power in rescuing them from their enemies.
Thus, the nineteenth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites came to a close.
There was ongoing peace among them, and the Church experienced great prosperity due to their careful attention to the word of God, which was preached to them by Helaman, Shiblon, Corianton, Ammon, and others ordained by God, who were baptized unto repentance and sent forth to deliver their message to the people.
