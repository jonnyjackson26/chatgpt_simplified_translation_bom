After Alma spoke these words to them, he sat down on the ground, and Amulek stood up to teach them, saying:
My friends, I believe it is impossible for you to be unaware of what has been said about the coming of Christ, who is taught to be the Son of God; I know these teachings were shared with you abundantly before you disagreed and left us.
And as you have asked my dear brother to tell you what you should do because of your troubles; he has shared some things to help you prepare your minds; and he has urged you to have faith and be patient—
Yes, so much faith that you would plant the word in your hearts to test its goodness.
And we can see that the main question in your minds is whether the word is in the Son of God, or if there will be no Christ.
And you have noticed that my brother has shown you many times that the word is in Christ for your salvation.
My brother has referenced the words of Zenos, saying that redemption comes through the Son of God, and also the words of Zenock; he even appealed to Moses to prove that these things are true.
And now, I will testify to you personally that these things are true. I know that Christ will come among mankind, to take on the sins of his people, and he will atone for the sins of the world; for this is what the Lord God has said.
It is essential that an atonement is made; according to the great plan of God, there must be an atonement, or else all humanity will be lost; yes, all are hardened; all are fallen and lost, having to perish unless it is through the necessary atonement.
It is essential that there should be a great and final sacrifice; not a sacrifice of a person, nor of any beast or bird; it cannot be a human sacrifice; but it must be something infinite and eternal.
No man can give his own blood to atone for someone else's sins. If someone commits murder, does our just law not require the murderer to lose his life? I say to you, no.
The law demands the life of the murderer; therefore, nothing less than an infinite atonement can be sufficient for the sins of the world.
Thus, it is essential for there to be a great and final sacrifice, which will put an end to bloodshed; then the law of Moses will be fulfilled; yes, it will be completely fulfilled, down to every last letter, and none will be removed.
And behold, this is the entire purpose of the law, every detail pointing to that great final sacrifice; and that great final sacrifice will be the Son of God, yes, infinite and eternal.
And through him, salvation will be given to all who believe in his name; this is the goal of the final sacrifice, to bring about mercy that outweighs justice, and to provide a way for people to have faith that leads to repentance.
Thus, mercy meets the demands of justice and surrounds believers with safety, while those who do not have faith to repent are exposed to the full weight of justice; therefore, only those who have faith to repent will receive the great and eternal plan of redemption.
So may God help you, my brothers, that you may start to practice your faith toward repentance, calling upon his holy name for mercy;
Yes, cry out to him for mercy; for he is powerful to save.
Yes, humble yourselves, and continue to pray to him.
Cry out to him in your fields, over all your flocks.
Cry out to him in your homes, for all your family members, morning, noon, and evening.
Yes, call upon him against your enemies.
Yes, call upon him against the devil, who opposes all righteousness.
Cry out to him for your crops, so you may have success.
Cry out for the flocks, that they may grow.
But this is not all; you must pour out your souls in your private spaces and your secret places, and in your solitude.
Yes, and when you are not crying out to the Lord, let your hearts remain full, continually praying for your well-being and that of those around you.
Now, my dear brothers, do not think this is all; for after you have done all these things, if you neglect the needy, and the naked, and do not visit the sick and suffering, and share what you have with those in need—I say to you, if you neglect any of these things, then your prayers are pointless and do not benefit you, and you are like hypocrites denying the faith.
So, if you do not remember to be charitable, you are like worthless material that the refiners discard, and it is trampled underfoot by men.
Now, my brothers, I wish that after you have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, you come forward and demonstrate fruits of repentance.
Yes, I want you to come forward and not harden your hearts any longer; for now is the time and the day of your salvation; and if you will repent and not harden your hearts, immediately the great plan of redemption will unfold for you.
For indeed, this life is the time for people to prepare to meet God; yes, consider that today is the day to carry out our responsibilities.
And now, as I previously mentioned, since you have had so many witnesses, I urge you not to put off your repentance until the end; for after this life, which is given to prepare for eternity, if we do not make the most of our time here, we will enter into a night of darkness where no work can be done.
You cannot claim when you face that terrible moment, "I will repent, I will return to my God." No, you cannot say this; for that same spirit which possesses you as you leave this life will have the power to possess you in the next.
For behold, if you have delayed your repentance even until death, you have become subject to the spirit of the devil, and he claims you as his own; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord has left you and has no place in you, and the devil has complete power over you; and this is the ultimate state of the wicked.
I know this because the Lord has said he does not dwell in unholy places, but in the hearts of the righteous does he reside; yes, he also said that the righteous will dwell in his kingdom, never to leave; but their garments will be made clean through the blood of the Lamb.
And now, my dear brothers, I ask that you remember these things and work out your salvation with reverence before God, and no longer deny the coming of Christ;
That you no longer oppose the Holy Ghost, but receive it, and take upon yourselves the name of Christ; that you humble yourselves down to dust, and worship God wherever you are, in spirit and in truth; and that you live with daily gratitude for the many mercies and blessings he gives you.
Yes, I also urge you, my brothers, that you remain vigilant in prayer continually, that you may not be led away by the devil's temptations, that he may not overpower you, and that you do not become his subjects on the final day; for he rewards you with nothing good.
And now, my dear brothers, I would encourage you to be patient and to endure all kinds of hardships; do not speak ill of those who reject you because of your severe poverty, lest you become sinners like them;
But instead, have patience and bear these hardships, with firm hope that one day you will find rest from all your troubles.
