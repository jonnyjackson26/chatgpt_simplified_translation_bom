Guards were assigned to watch over the Lamanite prisoners, and they were forced to go and bury their own dead, as well as the dead Nephites who had been killed; Moroni placed men to oversee them while they worked.
Moroni, together with Lehi, went to the city of Mulek, took control of it, and handed it over to Lehi. This Lehi had been with Moroni in most of his battles, and he was similar in character to Moroni; they were happy to see each other safe, and they were loved by one another as well as by the Nephite people.
Once the Lamanites finished burying their dead and the Nephite dead, they were marched back into the land of Bountiful, and Moroni ordered Teancum to have them start digging a ditch around the city of Bountiful.
Moroni instructed that they should build a solid wooden wall on the inside of the ditch, and they piled dirt from the ditch against the wooden wall; thus, the Lamanites worked until they had completely surrounded the city of Bountiful with a tall and strong wall made of wood and earth.
This city became a very strong fortress from then on, and the prisoners of the Lamanites were kept there, even within a wall that they had built with their own labor. Moroni had to make the Lamanites work because it was easier to guard them while they were busy, and he wanted all his troops prepared for an attack on the Lamanites.
As a result, Moroni achieved a victory over one of the largest Lamanite armies and captured the city of Mulek, which was one of the Lamanites' strongest positions in Nephi; thus, he also built a secure place to keep his prisoners.
After this, he did not try to fight the Lamanites again that year, but rather focused on getting his men ready for war, reinforcing defenses against the Lamanites, rescuing their women and children from hunger and suffering, and providing food for their armies.
Now, while Moroni was absent due to some conflicts among the Nephites that led to divisions within them, the Lamanite armies in the southern region by the west sea made some gains against the Nephites, taking several of their cities in that area.
Their internal conflicts, due to wickedness and divisions among themselves, placed them in a very dangerous situation.
Now regarding the people of Ammon, who were originally Lamanites: they were converted to the Lord through Ammon and his brothers, by the power of God, and had moved to the land of Zarahemla, where they were protected by the Nephites.
Because of their oath, they refused to take up weapons against their own people, having promised never to shed blood again; and they would have perished or allowed themselves to be captured by their own brethren if it weren't for the compassion and great love that Ammon and his brothers showed them.
This led to their arrival in Zarahemla, where they were always safe thanks to the Nephites.
However, when they recognized the danger and the troubles the Nephites faced for their sake, they felt compassion and wanted to fight to defend their homeland.
Just as they were about to grab their weapons, Helaman and his brothers convinced them not to break their oath.
Helaman was concerned that if they broke their promise, they would endanger their souls; therefore, those who had made this covenant were forced to watch their brethren struggle in perilous situations at this time.
However, they had many sons who had not made the same vow to refrain from fighting, so those who were able to take up arms gathered together, calling themselves Nephites.
They made a promise to fight for the freedom of the Nephites, pledging to defend their land even at the cost of their lives; they vowed never to give up their liberty and to fight for the Nephites and themselves against oppression.
Behold, there were two thousand young men who joined this promise and took up weapons to defend their country.
These young men had not previously been a burden to the Nephites; they were now a significant asset, as they all took their weapons and chose Helaman to be their leader.
They were all young men, full of courage, strength, and energy; but whatâ€™s more, they were trustworthy and responsible in all tasks assigned to them.
They were honest and serious, having been taught to keep God's commandments and live uprightly before Him.
Following this, Helaman led his two thousand young soldiers to support the people living in the southern borders by the west sea.
Thus ended the twenty-eighth year of the judges' reign over the people of Nephi.
