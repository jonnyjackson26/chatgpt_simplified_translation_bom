Moroni prepares for battle and defends his people against the Lamanites by having his armies start digging trenches around all the cities in Nephite territory at the beginning of the twentieth year of the judges' reign. 
On top of these earth ridges, he had wooden structures built up to a height of a person around the cities. 
He had frames of wooden stakes constructed on these structures, making them strong and tall. 
Moroni also had towers built that overlooked these wooden stakes, with secure areas on the towers to protect them from the stones and arrows of the Lamanites. 
From the tops of these towers, they could throw stones at anyone trying to get close to the city walls. 
Moroni set up stronghold defenses all around every city in the land against their enemies. 
Next, he sent his armies into the eastern wilderness, driving all the Lamanites who were there back into their own lands, located south of Zarahemla. 
The land of Nephi extended in a straight line from the east sea to the west. 
Once Moroni cleared the Lamanites from the eastern wilderness that was north of their own territories, he allowed the inhabitants of Zarahemla and the surrounding areas to move into the eastern wilderness and settle by the seashore. 
He also stationed armies in the south along the borders of their territories and had them build fortifications to protect their people from enemy attacks. 
Thus, he cut off all Lamanite strongholds in the eastern wilderness and fortified the border between the Nephites and Lamanites, securing the area from the west sea to the head of the river Sidon, with the Nephites possessing all the land northward, extending even beyond the land of Bountiful. 
With the assurance of safety provided by his defenses, Moroni and his ever-growing armies aimed to diminish the strength and influence of the Lamanites over their lands. 
The Nephites started building a new city, naming it Moroni, located by the east sea and south of the Lamanite territories. 
They also began constructing another city between Moroni and Aaron, naming this one Nephihah. 
In that same year, they built multiple cities in the northern area, including one specifically called Lehi, situated along the northern seashore. 
This marked the end of the twentieth year. 
During these successful times, the Nephite people thrived as they began the twenty-first year of the judges' rule. 
They became very prosperous and rich, multiplying and growing stronger in the land. 
This shows how merciful and fair the Lord is in all His dealings, fulfilling His promises to mankind; we see His words being confirmed right now, just as He told Lehi: 
“Blessed are you and your children; they will be blessed as long as they follow my commandments. But remember, if they do not keep my commandments, they will be cut off from My presence.” 
These promises have proven true for the Nephites; their conflicts, quarrels, murders, thefts, idolatries, sexual immorality, and other wicked acts among themselves have led to their wars and destructions. 
Those who remained faithful to the Lord's commandments were always saved, while many of their sinful brothers faced captivity, death by the sword, or joined the Lamanites. 
Indeed, there has been no happier period among the Nephites since Nephi's time than during Moroni's leadership, especially in the twenty-first year. 
The twenty-second year of the judges' reign ended with peace, as did the twenty-third year. 
However, in the start of the twenty-fourth year, there would have been peace among the Nephites if not for a dispute over the lands of Lehi and Morianton, which were near the seashore. 
People living in Morianton claimed part of Lehi’s land, causing a serious dispute and leading them to take up arms against their neighbors, intent on killing them. 
The people of Lehi sought refuge in Moroni’s camp, pleading for his help because they had done nothing wrong. 
When the Morianton people, led by a man named Morianton, learned that the people of Lehi had fled to Moroni’s camp, they feared an assault from Moroni’s army. 
Thus, Morianton suggested that they escape to the northern lands, which were mostly water, and take control of the northern territory. 
They nearly went through with this plan, which would have been disastrous, but Morianton, filled with anger, severely beat one of his slave girls. 
She escaped to Moroni’s camp and informed him of everything, including their plans to flee to the north. 
The people in Bountiful, or Moroni’s camp, worried that they would listen to Morianton and join him, which would have serious repercussions for the Nephite people and threaten their freedom. 
So, Moroni sent an army to intercept the Morianton people and prevent their escape to the north. 
However, they didn't catch them until they reached the borders of the land Desolation, where they intercepted them at a narrow pass leading by the sea into the north. 
Moroni's army, led by Teancum, confronted the Morianton people. Stubborn and emboldened by their wicked leader's flattering words, a battle broke out, resulting in Teancum killing Morianton, defeating his army, taking prisoners, and returning to Moroni’s camp. This concluded the twenty-fourth year of the judges' reign over the Nephite people. 
The Morianton people were brought back, and upon agreeing to maintain peace, they were restored to their land and united with the Lehi people. 
That same year of restored peace, Nephihah, the second chief judge, passed away after serving righteously in the judgment seat before God. 
However, he had denied Alma access to sacred records and items, which Alma and his ancestors considered most holy; thus, Alma entrusted them to his son, Helaman. 
The son of Nephihah was appointed to take his father’s place as chief judge and governor, sworn to judge fairly, preserve the peace and freedom of the people, support their right to worship God, and ensure that the wicked faced justice for their actions. 
His name was Pahoran. Pahoran succeeded his father and began his reign at the end of the twenty-fourth year among the Nephite people.
