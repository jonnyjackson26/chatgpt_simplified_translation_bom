We decided that our next target was to capture the city of Manti, but our small forces couldn't lure the Lamanites out of the city. They were aware of our past strategies, making it impossible to draw them away from their fortifications.
The Lamanites outnumbered us significantly, so we couldn’t risk attacking them in their fortified positions.
It was necessary for us to keep our forces in the areas we had already reclaimed, so we decided to wait for more reinforcements from Zarahemla along with additional supplies.
I sent a message to our governor to keep him updated on our situation. While we waited for reinforcements and supplies from Zarahemla, we encountered more challenges.
This situation wasn’t very beneficial to us, as the Lamanites were also gaining strength and supplies daily; things were difficult for us during this time.
The Lamanites frequently came out against us, trying to find ways to destroy us; however, we couldn’t engage them due to their stronghold and quick retreats.
We endured these hard times for several months, even nearing starvation due to our lack of food.
But we eventually received provisions brought to us by an army of two thousand men, which was the only help we received to defend ourselves and our land from our many enemies.
We were troubled and fearful, unsure why more strength and support weren’t sent to us. We worried that this might bring the consequences of God’s judgment upon our land and lead to our destruction.
So, we earnestly prayed to God for strength and deliverance from our enemies, asking him to help us maintain our cities, lands, and possessions for the sake of our people.
And then, God reassured us that he would save us; he filled us with peace, great faith, and hope for our rescue.
We gathered the courage we had left and resolved to fight our enemies to keep our lands, possessions, wives, children, and the cause of our freedom.
Thus, we marched forward with all our strength against the Lamanites in the city of Manti, setting up our tents near the wilderness close to the city.
The next day, when the Lamanites noticed us at the border by the wilderness, they sent out spies to gather information about the size and strength of our army.
When they realized we weren’t numerous and feared we might cut them off from their supplies, they decided to prepare for battle, thinking they could easily defeat us with their large army.
Seeing them preparing for battle, I directed Gid and a few of his men to hide in the wilderness, and Teomner and some of his men did the same.
Gid and his men were on one side, while Teomner was on the other. Once they were hidden, I stayed with the rest of my army at the spot where we first set up camp, ready for the Lamanites to attack.
When the Lamanites finally charged toward us, I commanded my men to retreat into the wilderness.
The Lamanites pursued us quickly, eager to catch and kill us, following us into the wilderness while we managed to pass by Gid and Teomner without being noticed.
Once the Lamanite army had moved past, Gid and Teomner emerged from their hiding spots and captured the Lamanite spies to prevent them from returning to the city.
After dealing with the spies, they rushed to the city and attacked the remaining guards, killing them and taking control of the city.
This happened because the Lamanites had led almost their entire army into the wilderness, leaving only a few guards behind.
Thus, Gid and Teomner successfully captured their strongholds. We then set our course, having traveled a long way through the wilderness toward the land of Zarahemla.
When the Lamanites spotted Gid and Teomner heading toward Zarahemla, they grew fearful, suspecting a trap was being laid against them, so they decided to retreat back into the wilderness, taking the same route they had come.
It was nighttime when they set up their camp, as the Lamanite leaders thought we were exhausted from our march and believed they had forced us to retreat, leading them to neglect the city of Manti.
That night, I ordered my men to stay awake and march forward along a different path toward Manti.
Due to our night march, we managed to arrive before the Lamanites at the city of Manti the next day.
So, through this clever plan, we successfully took control of the city of Manti without any bloodshed.
When the Lamanite armies arrived near the city and saw we were ready for battle, they were filled with shock and fear, which made them flee into the wilderness.
Yes, the Lamanite armies retreated from this whole region. However, they took many women and children with them.
All the cities captured by the Lamanites are now back in our hands, and our families are returning home, except for those who were taken prisoner.
However, our forces are still small in comparison to the many cities we need to protect and the great possessions we have.
Still, we have faith in our God, who has given us victory over these lands, helping us reclaim our cities and properties.
We do not understand why the government hasn’t sent us greater reinforcements, nor do those who joined us know why more help hasn’t arrived.
Perhaps, they think your efforts are not successful, and you have redirected forces to the other side of the land; if that is the case, we will not complain.
If that’s not it, we fear there may be a division among the government causing them not to send more help since we know they have more troops than what they have sent.
Nevertheless, we trust that God will save us, despite our limited forces, and free us from our enemies.
This is now the latter part of the twenty-ninth year, and we hold onto our lands, while the Lamanites have fled to the land of Nephi.
The sons of the people of Ammon, whom I have praised highly, are with me in Manti, and the Lord has protected them, ensuring that not a single one has been killed.
However, they have suffered many injuries, yet they remain steadfast in the freedom God has given them, and they regularly remember to worship the Lord; they abide by his laws, judgments, and commandments, and their faith is strong regarding what is to come.
And now, dear brother Moroni, may God, who has redeemed and freed us, keep you always in his presence and grant you success in reclaiming all the things taken from us by the Lamanites, which were vital for our survival. So now, I conclude my letter. I am Helaman, the son of Alma.
