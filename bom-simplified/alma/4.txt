In the sixth year of the judges' rule over the Nephites, there were no arguments or wars in Zarahemla.
However, the people were suffering greatly due to the loss of their friends, and they had also lost their animals and their fields of grain, which the Lamanites had trampled and destroyed.
Their suffering was so intense that everyone had a reason to grieve; they believed these troubles were God's judgment on them for their wrongdoing and sins, which made them remember their responsibilities.
They started to strengthen the church; many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and joined God's church, with Alma, who had been made high priest by his father, performing the baptisms.
By the seventh year of the judges' reign, around three thousand five hundred people had joined the church and were baptized. This brought an end to the seventh year, during which there was peace.
In the eighth year of the judges' reign, the church members became arrogant because of their wealth—fine silks, high-quality linen, many flocks and herds, and a lot of gold and silver—all acquired through their hard work. They became proud and started wearing very expensive clothing.
This pride caused great distress for Alma and many others he had appointed to teach and lead the church; many were deeply saddened by the wickedness they observed among their people.
They watched in heartbreak as church members became proud and focused on wealth and worldly things, leading to scorn among each other and the persecution of those who didn't share their beliefs.
Thus, during the eighth year of the judges' reign, significant arguments began within the church, including envy, conflict, malice, and arrogance, surpassing even those outside the church.
The conclusion of the eighth year saw the church's growing wickedness become a serious obstacle for outsiders, causing the church to fall behind in its purpose.
At the start of the ninth year, Alma witnessed the church's wickedness, noting how it was guiding nonbelievers further into wrongdoing, leading towards destruction.
He saw great inequality, with some people puffed up with pride, looking down on others, ignoring the needs of the poor, hungry, thirsty, sick, and suffering.
This disparity caused much sorrow among the people, while some were humble, helping those in need, sharing their resources, feeding the hungry, and enduring hardships for the sake of Christ, whom they believed would come.
They looked forward to that day, keeping their sins forgiven and filled with joy due to the hope of resurrection through Jesus’ power over death.
Seeing the afflictions of the faithful followers of God and the persecutions they faced from others, as well as the inequalities present, Alma became extremely sad; however, the Spirit of the Lord remained with him.
He chose a wise elder from the church and empowered him, following the people's voice, to create and enforce laws appropriate to the people's wrongdoings.
This man, named Nephihah, was made chief judge and took his place to govern and judge the people.
Alma did not give him the position of high priest; he kept that role for himself but turned over the judgment seat to Nephihah.
He did this so he could personally go among his people to preach God's word, remind them of their duties, and use scripture to challenge the pride and deceitfulness that was growing amongst them, believing that only by directly confronting them with heartfelt testimony could he bring them back.
Thus, at the beginning of the ninth year of the judges' reign over the Nephites, Alma handed over the judgment seat to Nephihah and focused entirely on being high priest, committed to preaching the word according to revelation and prophecy.
