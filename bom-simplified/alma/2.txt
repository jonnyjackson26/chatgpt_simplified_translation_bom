In the beginning of the fifth year of their rule, a disagreement arose among the people because of a man named Amlici. He was very clever and knew much about worldly wisdom, similar to the man who killed Gideon and was punished by law. 
Amlici used his cunning to gather a large following, making them quite powerful as they tried to make him their king. 
This alarmed those in the church and others who weren’t swayed by Amlici’s arguments, as they understood that their laws required such leadership to be decided by the people’s voice. 
If Amlici managed to win the people’s support, he, being an immoral man, would take away their rights and privileges related to the church since he aimed to destroy God’s church.
So the people gathered from all over the land, forming groups based on their opinions for or against Amlici, and engaged in fierce debates with each other. 
They then joined together to vote on the issue, and the results were presented to the judges.
The voice of the people was against Amlici, and he was not made king.
This news brought great joy to those who opposed him, but Amlici inspired anger among his supporters toward those who disagreed with him.
Eventually, they gathered together and declared Amlici as their king.
Once crowned, Amlici commanded his followers to take up arms against their fellow Nephites in order to assert his control over them.
The followers of Amlici were known as Amlicites, while those who remained loyal were called Nephites or people of God.
The Nephites recognized the threat posed by the Amlicites and took precautions, arming themselves with swords, curved swords, bows and arrows, stones, slings, and all sorts of weapons.
They prepared to confront the Amlicites as they approached. Leaders of various ranks were appointed based on their numbers.
Amlici also equipped his followers with a variety of weapons and designated rulers and leaders to guide them in battle against their fellow Nephites.
The Amlicites launched their attack on the hill Amnihu, located east of the river Sidon, which flowed near Zarahemla.
Alma, the chief judge and governor of the Nephites, led his people along with their captains and chief captains into battle against the Amlicites.
They began to defeat the Amlicites on the hill east of Sidon. The Amlicites fought fiercely, causing some Nephites to fall in battle.
Despite this, the Lord strengthened the Nephites, enabling them to fight back and inflict great casualties on the Amlicites, who began to flee.
The Nephites pursued the Amlicites all day, killing many of them until they had slain a total of twelve thousand five hundred thirty-two Amlicites, while the Nephites lost six thousand five hundred sixty-two.
When Alma could no longer chase the Amlicites, he ordered his people to set up their tents in the valley of Gideon, named after Gideon, who was killed by Nehor.
In the valley, the Nephites camped for the night.
Alma sent spies to track the remaining Amlicites to learn their intentions and protect his people from future attacks.
Those he sent to watch the Amlicite camp were Zeram, Amnor, Manti, and Limher; they went out with their men to keep an eye on the Amlicites.
The next day they returned quickly to the Nephite camp, shocked and frightened, saying:
"We followed the Amlicite camp and were amazed to see a large group of Lamanites in the land of Minon, above Zarahemla. The Amlicites have teamed up with them. 
They are attacking our people in that area and pushing them back with their livestock, wives, and children toward our city. If we don’t hurry, they will take our city and kill our fathers, wives, and children."
The Nephites quickly took down their tents and left the valley of Gideon, moving toward their city, Zarahemla.
As they crossed the river Sidon, the Lamanites and Amlicites, being numerous like grains of sand, came upon them to destroy them.
Even so, the Nephites found strength from the Lord because they had prayed passionately for help, and the Lord heard their pleas. He empowered them, causing the Lamanites and Amlicites to fall before them.
Alma fought Amlici one-on-one, and they battled fiercely against each other.
Being a man of God and full of faith, Alma cried out, asking the Lord for mercy and to spare his life so he could help save his people.
After saying this, Alma continued to fight Amlici and was given strength, allowing him to slay Amlici with his sword.
He also fought the king of the Lamanites, who retreated from Alma and sent his guards to fight him instead.
Alma, along with his guards, engaged in battle with the Lamanite king's guards, defeating and repelling them.
Thus, he cleared the area on the west bank of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the slain Lamanites into the water so that his people could cross and confront the Lamanites and Amlicites on the west side.
When all the Nephites had crossed the river Sidon, the Lamanites and Amlicites began to flee from them, even though their numbers were overwhelming.
They ran toward the wilderness to the west and north, beyond the boundaries of the land, while the Nephites pursued them fiercely and killed many.
They encountered them everywhere and fought them until they were scattered in the west and north, eventually reaching the wilderness known as Hermounts, a region filled with wild, ferocious animals.
As a result, many were left to die in the wilderness from their wounds and were eaten by the beasts and vultures. Their bones have since been found and gathered on the earth.
