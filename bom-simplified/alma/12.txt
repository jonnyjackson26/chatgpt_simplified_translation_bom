Alma sees that Amulek has silenced Zeezrom, who feels guilty because Amulek revealed his lies. Realizing his wrongdoing, Zeezrom begins to tremble. Alma speaks to him, supporting Amulek’s words and explaining further, going beyond what Amulek had shared.
The crowd listens closely to Alma’s words because there are many gathered. 
Zeezrom, you have been exposed for your deceit and craftiness. You didn’t just lie to people, but to God as well; He knows your every thought, and His Spirit makes them known to us.
Your plan was cunning, similar to the devil’s, trying to turn this people against us, to mock us and push us away.
This was a trap set by your enemy, who has used his power over you. I want everyone to understand that what I’m saying to you applies to all.
I declare that this was a snare of the adversary, designed to ensnare this people, to make you all submit to him, trapping you with his chains, leading you to everlasting ruin through his power.
After hearing this, Zeezrom trembled even more, realizing the power of God. He understood that Alma and Amulek knew him well; he felt they could see his deepest thoughts because they had the gift of prophecy.
Curious, Zeezrom began to ask them questions to understand more about God’s kingdom. He asked Alma about Amulek’s mention of resurrection, questioning what it means that everyone will rise from the dead—both the righteous and the wicked—and face judgment for their actions.
Alma explained that many are able to understand God’s mysteries, but they are commanded not to share too much, only what God grants them based on how attentively people listen to Him.
Therefore, those who harden their hearts receive less understanding. On the other hand, those who remain open-hearted will gain deeper insights until they fully understand God’s mysteries.
Those who refuse to soften their hearts will receive limited knowledge about His mysteries and eventually fall under the devil’s influence, led to destruction. This is what is meant by being bound by the chains of hell.
Amulek has clearly explained death and what it means to leave this mortal life for immortality, facing God’s judgment based on our actions.
If our hearts are hardened—if we reject the Word to the point that it’s not found within us—our situation will be terrible; we will be condemned.
Our words and actions will condemn us; no one will be found innocent. Our thoughts will also accuse us, and in this dreadful state, we won’t be able to face God. Instead, we would wish for the mountains to fall on us to hide us from His sight.
But this cannot happen; we must stand before Him in His glory, power, and majesty, and admit to our eternal disgrace that His judgments are fair, that He is righteous in everything He does, and that He is compassionate to all people. He has the power to save anyone who believes in Him and truly repents.
Be aware that there will come a death— a second death, which is spiritual; this means that anyone who dies in sin, like a physical death, will also face a spiritual death, or death concerning righteousness.
This is when their suffering will feel like a never-ending fire; they will be bound to everlasting destruction as a result of Satan’s power over them.
Then, I tell you, they will seem as if no redemption ever occurred because they will not be saved according to God’s justice. They cannot escape since there will be no further corruption.
When Alma finished speaking, the people were left in shock.
But one of their leaders, named Antionah, approached him and asked: What does it mean to rise from the dead and change from a mortal to an immortal state, when the soul can never die?
He cited the scripture about God placing cherubim and a flaming sword at the entrance to Eden to prevent Adam and Eve from eating from the tree of life and living forever; this seems to indicate they had no chance to live eternally.
Alma replied, saying he was about to explain this. Adam fell because he ate the forbidden fruit as commanded by God; as a result, all humans became lost and fallen.
If Adam had eaten from the tree of life then, there would have been no death, which would make God a liar, as He had said: If you eat, you will surely die.
Death, which Amulek spoke of, is temporal death; however, there is a time given to man for repentance; thus, this life serves as a testing ground to prepare to meet God and for the eternal state after resurrection.
Without the plan of redemption that has been in place since the beginning, resurrection wouldn’t exist; but there is this plan in place that will bring forth resurrection.
If our first parents had eaten from the tree of life, they would have been forever miserable, having no chance to prepare; this would have ruined God’s plan and made His words meaningless.
However, this is not the case; men are destined to die, and after death, they face judgment—the final judgment just mentioned.
After God decreed these things for humanity, He decided that people must understand what He had determined for them.
So, He sent angels to speak with them, allowing them to see His glory.
From that moment, they began to call upon His name; thus, God interacted with humanity and shared His plan of redemption, which was prepared from the start. He revealed this according to their faith, repentance, and righteous actions.
Therefore, He provided commandments to people after they had first disobeyed the initial commands, becoming like gods and gaining knowledge of good and evil, placing themselves in a position to choose to act, either to do good or evil.
Hence, God gave them commandments after revealing His plan of redemption, warning them not to do wrong, as the consequence would be spiritual death—a perpetual separation from righteousness; for on those who do wrong, God's plan of redemption holds no power, as justice cannot be nullified by His supreme goodness.
But God called upon humanity in the name of His Son (which is part of the redemptive plan), saying: If you repent and do not harden your hearts, I will show you mercy through my Only Begotten Son.
So, anyone who repents without hardening their heart will receive mercy through my Only Begotten Son, resulting in the forgiveness of their sins, and these individuals will find peace.
But anyone who hardens their heart and continues in wrongdoing will not be allowed to find that peace.
Now, my brothers, if you harden your hearts, you won’t enter God’s rest; your sins provoke His anger so that He may unleash His wrath upon you as happened before, leading to your eternal destruction according to His words, resulting in a final death similar to the initial one.
And now, my brothers, since we know these truths, let’s repent and avoid hardening our hearts so we do not provoke God into bringing down His wrath upon us through His later commandments. Let’s strive to enter the peace of God, which is prepared according to His promises.
