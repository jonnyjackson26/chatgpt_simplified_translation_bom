After he finished speaking to the crowd, many of them believed his words, began to change their ways, and started looking into the scriptures.
However, most of them were eager to harm Alma and Amulek; they were furious with Alma for his clear and direct words to Zeezrom and accused Amulek of lying, as well as speaking against their laws, lawyers, and judges.
They became angry with Alma and Amulek because they clearly condemned the people's wickedness, and they plotted to get rid of them secretly.
But they didn’t manage to keep it quiet; instead, they tied them up with strong ropes and brought them before the main judge of the land.
The people came forward to accuse them—claiming that they spoke against the law, and against the judges and lawyers, and that they declared there was only one God who would send His Son among them but would not save them; and they made many other accusations against Alma and Amulek. This took place in front of the chief judge.
Zeezrom was amazed by what was being said, and he recognized the confusion he had caused among the people with his lies. Guilt began to weigh heavily on him, and he felt tormented by the realization of his wrongdoing.
In that moment, he cried out to the people, admitting his guilt and affirming that Alma and Amulek were innocent before God. From then on, he pleaded for their sake, but they insulted him, asking if he was possessed by a devil. They spat on him, expelled him from their midst, and did the same to anyone who believed in what Alma and Amulek had said, throwing stones at them.
They gathered their wives and children and anyone who believed or had been taught to believe in God’s word, and ordered them to be thrown into the fire. They even took the sacred records that contained their holy scriptures and threw those into the fire as well, intending to burn and destroy them.
Then they took Alma and Amulek to the place of execution so they could witness the burning of those who were consumed in the flames.
When Amulek saw the suffering of the women and children who were burning, it hurt him deeply; he said to Alma: How can we stand by and watch this terrible sight? Let’s reach out with the power of God within us to save them from the fire.
But Alma replied: The Spirit is not allowing me to act; the Lord is taking them to Himself in glory. He allows this to happen to them according to the hardness of the people's hearts, so that His judgments against them will be justified, and the blood of the innocent will testify against them mightily at the last judgment.
Amulek then said to Alma: What if they decide to burn us too?
Alma answered: Whatever the Lord decides is fine. However, our mission is not complete yet, so they won’t burn us.
After the bodies of those cast into the fire were consumed, along with the records, the chief judge stood before Alma and Amulek, who were still bound, and struck them on the cheek, asking if they would preach again that the people would be thrown into eternal punishment after what they had witnessed.
He said: You see that you were unable to save those cast into the fire; God hasn’t saved them either because they held your faith. He struck them again and asked: What do you have to say for yourselves?
This judge was like Nehor, who had killed Gideon.
Alma and Amulek said nothing in response, so he struck them again and ordered that they be sent to prison.
After three days in prison, many lawyers, judges, priests, and teachers from Nehor's group came to see them, asking many questions, but they remained silent.
Then the judge confronted them, asking: Why don’t you respond to what the people say? Don’t you know I can hand you over to the flames? He insisted that they speak; still, they said nothing.
The next day, they returned, and the judge struck them again. Many others also came and hit them, demanding: Will you judge the people again and condemn our law? If you have such great power, why can't you save yourselves?
They mocked Alma and Amulek in various ways, taunting them and expressing fear about their own damnation.
For many days, they continued to insult them and withheld food and water, leaving them to suffer in hunger and thirst. They also stripped them of their clothes, leaving them naked, as they were tightly bound and imprisoned.
After enduring this for many days, on the twelfth day of the tenth month in the tenth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites, the chief judge of Ammonihah and many of his teachers and lawyers came to the prison where Alma and Amulek were still bound.
The chief judge confronted them again, struck them, and said: If you truly have God's power, free yourselves from these binds, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people as you claim.
They all beat them while saying the same words, until the last person had spoken. At that moment, the power of God came upon Alma and Amulek, and they stood up on their feet.
Then Alma called out: How long must we endure these great sufferings, O Lord? Please give us strength according to our faith in Christ, even to the point of deliverance. They broke the cords that held them, and when the people saw this, fear overtook them, causing them to flee.
So great was their fear that they fell to the ground and couldn't reach the prison's exit; the ground shook violently, and the prison walls collapsed, killing the chief judge, the lawyers, priests, and teachers who had abused Alma and Amulek.
Alma and Amulek emerged from the prison unharmed, for the Lord had given them strength based on their faith in Christ. They walked out of the prison and were free from their bonds; the prison walls had fallen, and everyone inside, except for Alma and Amulek, perished. They then went straight into the city.
When the crowd heard the loud noise, they rushed together in large numbers to find out what had happened. When they saw Alma and Amulek coming out of the ruins of the prison, they were filled with fear and ran away from them like a mother goat flees from two lions; thus, they fled from Alma and Amulek.
