If only I were an angel and could fulfill my heart's desire, to go out and proclaim with the trumpet of God, using a voice that could shake the earth, and call everyone to repent!
Yes, I would shout to every person, like a great thunderclap, urging them to repent and understand the plan of redemption, so they could turn to our God and bring an end to the sorrow experienced across the earth.
But I realize that I am just a man and I sin in my desires, because I should be satisfied with what the Lord has given me.
I shouldn't disturb the firm decisions of a fair God with my wishes, as I know He gives to people according to their desires, whether that leads to death or life; indeed, He sets unchangeable laws for everyone based on their intentions, whether it leads to salvation or destruction.
I know that good and evil have been presented to all people; those who don't understand the difference are innocent, but those who do will receive according to their wishes, whether they desire goodness or wickedness, life or death, joy or guilt.
Now that I understand these things, why should I want anything more than to fulfill the role I’ve been assigned?
Why should I wish to be an angel so I could speak to everyone everywhere?
The Lord allows each nation, in their own language and culture, to spread His word, imparting wisdom as He sees fit; thus, we understand that the Lord guides with wisdom, ensuring what is fair and true.
I know what the Lord has commanded me, and I take pride in it. My pride isn't in myself, but in what the Lord has instructed me; yes, my joy lies in being a tool in God's hands to help bring someone to repentance.
When I see so many of my fellow believers genuinely penitent and turning to the Lord, my heart fills with joy; I then remember everything the Lord has done for me, especially how He has listened to my prayers, and I recall His merciful support extended to me.
I also reflect on my ancestors’ captivity; I know for sure that the Lord freed them from bondage, which led to the establishment of His church; the Lord God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, delivered them from their slavery.
I have always remembered my ancestors' captivity, and that same God who rescued them from the Egyptians also liberated them from bondage.
This same God established His church among them; He has called me with a sacred calling to share His word with this people, and He has granted me much success, which fills my heart with joy.
My joy isn't solely from my own achievements; I feel even greater happiness in the success of my fellow laborers who have traveled to the land of Nephi.
Look at how hard they have worked and the great results they have produced; their reward will be immense!
When I think about the success of my brothers, my soul feels uplifted, almost to the point of leaving my body due to the overwhelming joy.
Now, may God grant that my brothers get to sit in His kingdom; and may all those who benefit from their work also find a place there, so they can praise Him forever. And may God make this true according to my words, just as I have said. Amen.
