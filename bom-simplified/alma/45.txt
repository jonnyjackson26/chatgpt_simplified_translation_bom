The story of the Nephite people, their conflicts and disagreements during Helaman's time, based on the records he maintained.
This includes chapters up to 62.
Helaman trusts Alma's words—Alma predicts the Nephites' downfall—He offers blessings and curses for the land—Alma may have been taken by the Spirit, similar to Moses—Tensions in the Church increase. Around 73 B.C.
Look, the Nephites were very happy because the Lord had saved them from their enemies again; so they thanked the Lord their God. They fasted and prayed a lot and worshiped God with immense joy.
In the nineteenth year of the judges' rule over the Nephites, Alma approached his son Helaman and asked: Do you believe the words I told you about the records that have been kept?
Helaman replied: Yes, I believe.
Alma then asked: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, who is to come?
Helaman answered: Yes, I believe everything you have said.
Alma continued: Will you follow my commandments?
Helaman responded: Yes, I will follow your commandments with all my heart.
Then Alma said: You are blessed; the Lord will help you thrive in this land.
But listen, I need to tell you a prophecy; however, you must not share it until it comes true, so write down what I say.
Here are the words: I see that this very people, the Nephites, through revelation, will lose their faith in four hundred years after Jesus Christ shows himself to them.
Yes, they will then face wars, diseases, famines, and bloodshed until the Nephites are no longer a people—
This is because they will lose their faith and fall into darkness, immorality, and all kinds of wrongdoing. I tell you, because they will sin against such great light and knowledge, I assure you that the fourth generation will not pass away before this great wickedness happens.
When that day arrives, soon those who are now, or are descendants of those currently among the Nephites, will no longer be considered Nephites.
But those who survive and are not destroyed on that terrible day will be counted among the Lamanites and will become like them, except for a few who will be called the disciples of the Lord; these few will be pursued by the Lamanites until they are no more. Because of the wickedness, this prophecy will come to pass.
After Alma shared these words with Helaman, he blessed him and his other sons; he also blessed the land for the righteous.
He said: This is what the Lord God says—This land will be cursed, yes, this land, for every nation, race, language, and people that does evil when their time is full. What I say will happen; this is the blessing and curse of God on the land, because the Lord cannot tolerate sin in any form.
After Alma spoke these words, he blessed the church and all those who would remain steadfast in faith from that time onward.
Once he finished, Alma left the land of Zarahemla, apparently heading towards Melek. After that, he was never heard from again; we do not know about his death or burial.
What we do know is that he was a righteous man; there was a saying in the church that he was taken by the Spirit or buried by the Lord's hand, just like Moses. The Scriptures say the Lord took Moses to Himself, and we assume that Alma was similarly received in the spirit; therefore, we know nothing about his death and burial.
At the beginning of the nineteenth year of the judges' reign over the Nephites, Helaman went among the people to share the message with them.
This was necessary because of their wars with the Lamanites and the numerous small conflicts among the people, so it was important that God's word be proclaimed and that rules be established in the church.
So, Helaman and his brothers went out to re-establish the church across the land and in every city among the Nephites. They appointed priests and teachers throughout all the land for all the churches.
After Helaman and his brothers appointed priests and teachers, disagreements arose among them, and they stopped listening to Helaman and his brothers;
Instead, they became proud and haughty due to their immense wealth; they saw themselves as rich and would not heed the guidance to live righteously before God.
