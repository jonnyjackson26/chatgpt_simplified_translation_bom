In the twenty-sixth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites, the Lamanites woke up one morning to find Amalickiah dead in his tent, and Teancum was ready to fight them that day.
When the Lamanites realized this, they were frightened; they gave up their plan to march north and retreated with their entire army into the city of Mulek, seeking safety behind their fortifications.
Amalickiah's brother was made king over the Lamanites, and he was named Ammoron; thus, Ammoron became king in place of his brother Amalickiah.
He ordered his people to hold onto the cities they had captured, for they had lost many lives in doing so.
Teancum noticed that the Lamanites were set on keeping the cities and land they had taken, and seeing their huge numbers, he decided not to attack them in their forts.
Instead, he kept his men nearby as if preparing for war; indeed, he was getting ready to defend himself by building walls and setting up strategic positions.
He continued making preparations for war until Moroni sent many soldiers to strengthen his army.
Moroni instructed him to keep all the prisoners he captured; since the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, he should hold onto them as leverage for those the Lamanites had taken.
He also ordered Teancum to fortify the land of Bountiful and protect the narrow pass leading north, so the Lamanites wouldn’t be able to take that point and threaten them from all sides.
Moroni sent a message asking Teancum to stay vigilant in defending that part of the land, and to look for every chance to weaken the Lamanites there, so he might regain the cities lost; he was also to strengthen and fortify the cities that had not fallen to the Lamanites.
He added that he wished he could come to him, but the Lamanites were attacking them near the western sea; he was going to confront them, so he could not come.
Ammoron had left the land of Zarahemla, informing the queen about his brother’s death, gathering many men, and marching against the Nephites in the western coastal areas.
He aimed to harass the Nephites and lure part of their forces away, while instructing his remaining troops to hold the cities they captured and harass the Nephites at the eastern sea, seizing as much land as they could based on their army's strength.
Thus, the Nephites faced these dangerous circumstances at the end of the twenty-sixth year of the judges’ reign over the people of Nephi.
However, in the twenty-seventh year of the judges’ reign, Teancum, under Moroni’s command—who had set up armies to protect the southern and western borders and started marching toward Bountiful to assist Teancum in retaking lost cities—
Teancum received orders to attack and reclaim the city of Mulek if possible.
He got ready to assault the city and march against the Lamanites, but seeing it was impossible to overpower them while they were fortified, he abandoned the plan and returned to Bountiful to wait for Moroni’s arrival for reinforcements.
Moroni arrived at Bountiful toward the end of the twenty-seventh year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites.
At the beginning of the twenty-eighth year, Moroni, Teancum, and several chief captains held a war council to decide how to draw the Lamanites out of their defenses for battle, seeking a way to cleverly force them out so they could reclaim Mulek.
They sent envoys to the Lamanite army protecting Mulek, asking their leader Jacob to confront them on the plains between the cities. But Jacob, a Zoramite, refused to engage on the plains.
With no hope of meeting them in a fair fight, Moroni decided to lure the Lamanites out from their defenses.
He ordered Teancum to take a small group of men and march near the beach while he, with his army, stealthily moved through the wilderness west of Mulek. The next day, when the Lamanite guards spotted Teancum, they rushed to inform Jacob.
The Lamanite armies advanced toward Teancum, thinking they could easily overpower him due to their larger numbers. Seeing them approach, Teancum began to retreat toward the northern seashore.
When the Lamanites saw him fleeing, they gained confidence and chased after him vigorously. As Teancum led the Lamanites in pursuit, Moroni instructed part of his army to enter the city and seize it.
They successfully captured the city, killing all those left to defend it who refused to surrender their weapons.
Thus, Moroni gained control of Mulek with part of his army while moving with the rest to confront the Lamanites returning from chasing Teancum.
The Lamanites pursued Teancum until they were close to Bountiful, where they encountered Lehi and a small force left to protect the city.
When the Lamanite leaders saw Lehi approaching with his troops, they fled in confusion, worried they wouldn't reach Mulek before Lehi caught up with them, as they were exhausted from marching while Lehi’s men were still fresh.
The Lamanites were unaware that Moroni was behind them with his army; their only concern was Lehi and his men.
Lehi didn’t wish to overtake them until they encountered Moroni and his army.
Before long, the Lamanites found themselves surrounded by the Nephite forces, with Moroni’s men on one side and Lehi’s on the other, all fresh and strong while the Lamanites were weary from their long march.
Moroni ordered his men to engage and force the Lamanites to surrender their weapons.
Jacob, their leader and a determined Zoramite, led the Lamanites fiercely against Moroni, seeking to break through to Mulek. However, Moroni and his troops were stronger and did not yield to the Lamanites.
A fierce battle erupted, with many casualties on both sides; Moroni was injured and Jacob was killed.
Lehi pushed forward with great force from behind, causing those Lamanites in the rear to give up their weapons while the rest, confused, didn’t know where to flee or fight.
Seeing their confusion, Moroni told them: If you will surrender your weapons, we will not kill you.
When the Lamanites heard this, their remaining leaders came forward and threw down their weapons at Moroni's feet, commanding their men to do the same.
However, many refused to surrender; those who would not give up their swords were captured and bound, having their weapons taken, and were forced to march with their fellow soldiers into Bountiful.
Ultimately, the number of prisoners taken far exceeded the number slain, exceeding the casualties on both sides.
