The instructions from Alma to his son Corianton.
Covering chapters up to 42.
Engaging in sexual sin is very wrong—Corianton’s actions prevented the Zoramites from accepting the message—Christ's redemption also applies to those who lived before him. Around 74 B.C.
Now, my son, I want to talk to you about something in addition to what I said to your brother; have you noticed how steady your brother is, his faithfulness, and how he diligently follows God’s commandments? He has set a good example for you.
You did not pay as much attention to my teachings as your brother did among the Zoramites. This is what I have against you; you became boastful about your own strength and wisdom.
That’s not all, my son. You did something that really upset me; you abandoned your ministry and went into the land of Siron, near the Lamanites, to pursue the harlot Isabel.
Yes, she led many astray; but that’s no excuse for you. You should have focused on the ministry you were entrusted with.
Don’t you know, my son, that such actions are detestable to the Lord? They are among the worst sins, second only to murdering innocent people or denying the Holy Ghost.
Because if you deny the Holy Ghost after having received it, and you know you are denying it, that is a sin that cannot be forgiven; and whoever kills while knowing the truth of God finds it hard to obtain forgiveness.
And now, my son, I wish you had not committed such a serious sin. I wouldn’t bring up your wrongdoing just to make you feel bad if it weren’t important for your well-being.
But you cannot hide your sins from God; if you don’t repent, they will stand against you on the final day of judgment.
Now, my son, I want you to repent and turn away from your sins. Don’t follow your lustful desires anymore, but restrain yourself in all these matters; for unless you do this, you cannot inherit God’s kingdom. Please remember this and take it to heart.
I urge you to consult your older brothers about your decisions; you are still young and need their guidance. Pay attention to their advice.
Don’t let yourself be led astray by foolish things; don’t allow the devil to pull your heart back to those wicked harlots. Look at the great trouble your actions caused among the Zoramites; they lost faith in my words because of your behavior.
Now the Spirit of the Lord tells me: I must instruct my children to do good, so they don’t lead many away to destruction; therefore, my son, I urge you in the fear of God to move away from your wrongdoings.
Turn to the Lord with all your heart, strength, and mind; don’t lead anyone else to do evil; instead, seek to return to them, admit your errors and the harm you have caused.
Don’t pursue riches or the empty things of this world; remember, you can’t take these things with you.
Now, my son, I want to share a few thoughts with you about the coming of Christ. I tell you, it is he who will come to take away the sins of the world; he comes to bring good news of salvation to his people.
And now, my son, this is the work you were called to do, to share this good news with the people, to prepare their hearts; or rather, for salvation to come to them, so that they can prepare their children to hear the word of God at his coming.
Now, I want to help you feel better about this. You might wonder why these things have been revealed in advance. I tell you, is not every soul just as valuable to God now as it will be at the time of his coming?
Isn't it just as important for the people to know the plan of redemption now as it will be for their children in the future?
Isn’t it just as easy for the Lord to send his angel to convey this good news to us now as it will be for our children, or even after his coming?
