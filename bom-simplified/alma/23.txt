The king of the Lamanites announced to all his people that they should not harm Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Himni, or any of their fellow preachers of God’s word, no matter where they were in the land.
He issued a decree stating that they should not bind, imprison, spit on, hit, or remove these preachers from their places of worship; they were not to stone them, and they should be allowed free access to their homes, temples, and sacred places.
This way, they could go out and preach as they wished, because the king and his whole family had turned to the Lord. He wanted his people to hear the word of God without any barriers, so they could realize the sinful traditions of their ancestors, understand that they were all brothers, and recognize that they should not kill, steal, commit adultery, or engage in any kind of wrongdoing.
After the king made this announcement, Aaron and his companions traveled from city to city and from one place of worship to another, setting up churches and appointing priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites to share the word of God; they began to achieve great success.
Many thousands came to know the Lord, believing in the traditions of the Nephites; they were taught about the records and prophecies that had been passed down to their time.
Just as surely as the Lord lives, those who believed and were enlightened by the teachings of Ammon and his companions—through divine revelation, prophecy, and the miracles of God—never turned away. Among those Lamanites who accepted their teachings and were converted, none ever fell back into disbelief.
They became a righteous group, laying down their weapons of rebellion and choosing not to fight against God or their brothers anymore.
These are the people who converted to the Lord:
The Lamanites living in the land of Ishmael;
Also the Lamanites in the land of Middoni;
The Lamanites in the city of Nephi;
And the Lamanites in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Shemlon, as well as those in the cities of Lemuel and Shimnilom.
These are the cities of the Lamanites that turned to the Lord, and they laid down all their weapons of war; all of them were Lamanites.
The Amalekites did not convert, except for one, and none of the Amulonites did either; instead, they hardened their hearts and led many Lamanites in the area to do the same, affecting all their towns and cities.
Thus, we have identified all the cities of the Lamanites that repented, came to understand the truth, and became converted.
When this happened, the king and those who had converted wanted to have a name that set them apart from their fellow Lamanites; therefore, the king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests about what name they should take.
They decided to call themselves Anti-Nephi-Lehies, and from that point on, they were no longer called Lamanites.
They began to be a very hardworking people; they developed friendly relations with the Nephites, so they reached out to them, and God’s curse no longer troubled them.
