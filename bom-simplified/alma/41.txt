In the Resurrection, people will rise to eternal happiness or eternal misery—doing wrong has never led to happiness—people who focus only on physical things are separated from God in this life—every person will regain the traits and characteristics they developed during their time on Earth.
Now, my son, I need to talk to you about the idea of restoration that has been mentioned; some people have misunderstood the scriptures and have gone badly astray because of this. I can tell that you have been troubled by this as well. But I will help clarify it for you.
I am telling you, my son, that the plan of restoration aligns perfectly with God’s sense of justice; everything must be brought back to its rightful place. It is both right and fair, through the power of Christ’s resurrection, that each person's spirit returns to their physical body, and that each part of the body returns to its rightful place.
It is also just according to God's justice that people should be judged based on their actions; if their actions were good in this life, and their hearts desired good, then they should, on the final day, return to what is good.
Conversely, if their actions were bad, then they will face the consequences of those evil actions. Therefore, all things will be set right—everything will return to its natural state—mortality will become immortality, and corruption will become incorruption—people will be raised to eternal happiness to join God's kingdom or to eternal misery to belong to the devil's kingdom, one on one side and the other on the opposite side.
One will rise to happiness based on their desire for it or good based on their desire for goodness; the other will rise to evil based on their desire for wrongdoing; just as they have wanted to do wrong continuously, they will receive their punishment when the time comes.
Similarly, if someone repents for their wrongdoings and seeks righteousness until the end of their life, they will be rewarded for their quest for goodness.
These are the people who are saved by the Lord; they are those who have been rescued from the endless darkness; their fate is determined by their own choices, whether they choose to do good or to do evil.
Now, God's decrees cannot be changed; therefore, the path is set, so anyone who chooses can walk it and find salvation.
Now listen, my son, do not risk offending God any further based on these doctrines you have already strayed into with your sins.
Don't think that because there is talk of restoration, you can move from sin to happiness. I tell you, wrongdoing has never equated to happiness.
Now, my son, everyone living purely by instinct, or in a fleshly state, is trapped in deep bitterness and sin; they are cut off from God in this existence and act against God’s nature; thus, they cannot experience true happiness.
Now, consider this: does restoration mean taking something natural and putting it in an unnatural state, or transforming it to something contrary to its original nature?
Oh, my son, that is not what it means; restoration means returning evil for evil, or flesh for flesh, or wicked for wicked—good for good; right for right; just for just; merciful for merciful.
So, my son, make sure to show mercy towards your fellow beings; act fairly, judge rightly, and continuously do good; if you do these things, you will receive your reward; you will also receive mercy again; justice will be returned to you; your righteous judgment will come back to you; and goodness will be rewarded to you.
What you send out will return to you; therefore, the idea of restoration condemns the sinner even more and does not justify them at all.
