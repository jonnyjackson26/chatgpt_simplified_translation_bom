Alma returned from Gideon after teaching the people many important lessons that couldn’t all be written down. He organized the church there like he had done in Zarahemla, and then he went back home to Zarahemla to rest from his work.
This marked the end of the ninth year of the judges' reign over the people of Nephi.
At the start of the tenth year of the judges' reign, Alma left and traveled to Melek, located west of the Sidon River, near the edge of the wilderness.
He began to teach the people in Melek according to God’s sacred order, which he had been called to uphold; he spread his teachings throughout the entire land of Melek.
People came to him from all around the borders of the wilderness area, and they were baptized all over the land.
After finishing his work in Melek, he left and journeyed three days north, eventually reaching a city called Ammonihah.
In Nephi, it was normal for people to name their lands, cities, and villages after the first person who settled there, and this was the case for Ammonihah.
When Alma arrived in Ammonihah, he started preaching God’s word to the people.
However, Satan had a strong influence over the hearts of the people in Ammonihah, so they refused to listen to what Alma had to say.
Despite this, Alma worked hard in prayer, seeking God's spirit to be poured out upon the people and hoping to baptize them for their repentance.
Nevertheless, the people hardened their hearts, telling him: "We know who you are; you’re Alma, the high priest over the church you’ve set up in many places. We are not a part of your church, and we don’t believe in your silly traditions."
They continued: "Since we are not part of your church, you have no authority over us. You’ve handed over the judgment-seat to Nephihah, so you are not our chief judge."
After saying this, they rejected all he said, insulted him, spat on him, and forced him out of their city. Alma then left to head towards another city called Aaron.
As he traveled there, weighed down by sorrow and facing much suffering because of the wickedness in Ammonihah, an angel of the Lord appeared to him.
The angel said: "You are blessed, Alma; lift up your head and be glad, because you have plenty of reasons to rejoice. You have been faithful in keeping God’s commandments since you received your first message from Him. I was the one who delivered that message to you."
Furthermore, the angel commanded him to return to Ammonihah and preach to the people again, warning them that unless they repent, God will destroy them.
The angel said: "Right now, they are working to take away the freedom of your people, which goes against the laws and commandments God has given them."
After hearing the message from the angel, Alma quickly returned to Ammonihah, entering the city through a different route, from the south side.
As he entered the city, he was hungry and asked a man, "Will you give some food to a humble servant of God?"
The man replied: "I am a Nephite, and I know you are a holy prophet of God because an angel said in a vision that you would receive help. Come to my house, and I will feed you; I believe you will be a blessing to me and my family."
The man welcomed Alma into his home; his name was Amulek. He offered him bread and meat to eat.
Alma ate the bread and felt satisfied. He blessed Amulek and his household and thanked God.
After finishing his meal, Alma said to Amulek: "I am Alma, the high priest over God’s church across the land."
He continued: "I have been called to preach God’s word to this people, guided by the spirit of revelation and prophecy. When I came here, they rejected me and kicked me out, and I was ready to leave this land for good."
"But I have been commanded to return and prophesy to them, calling them out for their wrongdoings."
"And now, Amulek, because you have taken care of me and welcomed me in, you are blessed; I was hungry because I hadn't eaten for many days."
Alma stayed with Amulek for many days before he began to preach to the people.
Meanwhile, the people continued to become more deeply entrenched in their sins.
God's word came to Alma, telling him: "Go, and also instruct my servant Amulek to go prophesy to this people, saying—Repent! For the Lord says, if you do not repent, I will come down in my anger; my anger will not be held back."
So Alma and Amulek went forth among the people to share God’s message with them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.
They were given such power that no prison could hold them, nor could anyone kill them; however, they did not use their power until they were imprisoned. This was so the Lord could demonstrate His power through them.
Then they went out and began to preach and prophesy to the people, guided by the spirit and authority God had given them.
