Zenos taught that people should pray and worship anywhere, and that God’s judgments are softened because of the Son—Zenock taught that mercy comes through the Son—Moses lifted up a representation of the Son of God in the wilderness. About 74 B.C.
After Alma said these things, they reached out to him, wanting to know if they should believe in one God to gain the blessings he had mentioned, or how they should plant the seed or the word he spoke of, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or how they should start to exercise their faith.
Alma replied: You have said that you can't worship your God because you've been kicked out of your synagogues. But I tell you, if you think you can't worship God, you are mistaken, and you should study the scriptures; if you think they taught you this, you don’t truly understand them.
Do you remember what Zenos, the ancient prophet, said about prayer or worship?
He said: You are merciful, O God, because you heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yes, you were merciful when I prayed for my enemies, and you turned them towards me.
Yes, O God, you were merciful to me when I cried out to you in my field; when I cried out in my prayer, you heard me.
And again, O God, when I returned to my house, you heard me in my prayer.
And when I went to my room, O Lord, and prayed to you, you heard me.
Yes, you are merciful to your children when they cry out to you, to be heard by you and not by people, and you will listen to them.
Yes, O God, you have been merciful to me and have listened to my cries among your congregations.
Yes, and you have also heard me when I was cast out and despised by my enemies; yes, you heard my pleas, and were angry with my enemies, taking swift action against them.
You heard me because of my suffering and my sincerity; and your mercy towards me comes through your Son, so I will cry to you in all my hardships, for my joy is in you; you have turned your judgments away from me because of your Son.
Now Alma asked them: Do you believe the scriptures that were written by the prophets of old?
Look, if you do, then you have to believe what Zenos said; for he said: You have turned away your judgments because of your Son.
Now, my brothers, I ask if you have read the scriptures? If you have, how can you not believe in the Son of God?
For it isn’t just written that Zenos spoke of these things; Zenock also spoke of them—
For he said: You are angry, O Lord, with this people because they refuse to understand the mercy you have given them because of your Son.
And now, my brothers, you can see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and because the people didn’t understand his words, they stoned him to death.
But wait, there’s more; these are not the only ones who have spoken about the Son of God.
Look, Moses also spoke of him; yes, and a sign was lifted up in the wilderness so that anyone who looked at it might live. Many did look and lived.
But few understood the significance of these things due to the hardness of their hearts. Many were so stubborn that they wouldn’t look, and therefore they perished. They didn’t look because they didn't believe it would heal them.
O my brothers, if you could be healed just by looking, would you not look immediately, or would you rather harden your hearts with doubt and be lazy, refusing to look, and end up dying?
If that's the case, woe will come upon you; but if not, then look around you and start to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to save his people, and that he will suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he will rise again from the dead, bringing about the resurrection, so that all people will stand before him to be judged on the last day according to their deeds.
And now, my brothers, I urge you to plant this word in your hearts, and as it begins to grow, nourish it with your faith. And it will grow into a tree of everlasting life within you. May God help you bear your burdens lightened by the joy of his Son. And all this is possible if you choose to do so. Amen.
