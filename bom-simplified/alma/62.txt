When Moroni got this letter, he felt encouraged and very happy because Pahoran was loyal and not a traitor to his country’s freedom.
However, he also felt deep sorrow because of the wrongdoing of those who had forced Pahoran from his position, essentially those who had revolted against their country and their God.
So Moroni took a small group of men as Pahoran requested, and he put Lehi and Teancum in charge of the rest of his army as he headed toward Gideon.
He raised the flag of liberty wherever he went and gathered as many supporters as he could on his way to Gideon.
Many people joined him and took up their swords to defend their freedom, determined not to be enslaved.
Thus, after gathering as many men as possible, Moroni reached Gideon, and when he combined forces with Pahoran, they became very strong, even stronger than the army of Pachus, the king of those who had turned against the freemen and taken over Zarahemla.
Moroni and Pahoran then marched with their armies into Zarahemla and faced the men of Pachus in battle.
Pachus was killed, his men were captured, and Pahoran was reinstated as the leader.
The captured men were put on trial according to the law, including those king-men who had been imprisoned, and were executed for refusing to fight in defense of their country, instead turning against it.
It was necessary for this law to be strictly enforced for the safety of the nation; anyone denying their freedom was quickly executed.
Thus ended the thirtieth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites, with Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to Zarahemla and punishing all who were not loyal to freedom.
As the thirty-first year began, Moroni quickly arranged for supplies and an army of six thousand men to be sent to Helaman to help him protect that part of the land.
He also sent another army of six thousand men along with enough food to Lehi and Teancum's forces to strengthen defenses against the Lamanites.
Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large group behind in Zarahemla, set out with another large force to Nephihah, determined to defeat the Lamanites there.
While marching towards Nephihah, they ambushed many Lamanites, killing a lot of them and seizing their supplies and weapons.
After capturing them, they made the Lamanites promise not to take up arms against the Nephites again.
Those who agreed to the covenant were sent to live among the people of Ammon, totaling about four thousand who survived.
After sending them away, Moroni and his army continued towards Nephihah, where they set up camp just outside the city.
Moroni wanted the Lamanites to come out and fight on the plains, but they were too afraid to face his large and courageous army.
That night, Moroni stealthily climbed up on the city wall to see where the Lamanite camp was located.
He found them camped to the east, all asleep. Moroni returned and had his men quickly prepare ropes and ladders to get down into the city.
Moroni directed his men to climb up on the wall and then let themselves down into the part of the city where the Lamanites weren’t stationed.
They all entered the city at night using the ropes and ladders, so by morning, they were all inside the city walls.
When the Lamanites awoke and realized Moroni's forces were in their city, they were terrified and fled through the escape route.
Seeing them run away, Moroni commanded his men to chase after them, killing many, capturing others, while the rest fled to the land of Moroni by the seashore.
Thus Moroni and Pahoran took over Nephihah without losing a single soldier, although many Lamanites were killed.
Many of the captured Lamanites wanted to join the people of Ammon and gain their freedom.
As many as desired this were granted their wish.
So all the Lamanite prisoners joined the people of Ammon and worked hard, farming and raising livestock, which relieved the Nephites of a heavy burden by removing all the captives.
After taking Nephihah and reducing the Lamanites’ army significantly, and recovering many Nephites who had been captured, Moroni moved from Nephihah to the land of Lehi.
When the Lamanites saw Moroni advancing, they were frightened and quickly retreated before his army.
Moroni and his army pursued the Lamanites from city to city until they joined forces with Lehi and Teancum, who also chased the Lamanites down to the seashore, reaching Moroni's land.
The Lamanite armies gathered together so that they were all in one place in the land of Moroni, with Ammoron, their king, among them.
Moroni, Lehi, and Teancum camped their armies around the borders of Moroni, completely surrounding the Lamanites near the wilderness.
They set up camp for the night. Both the Nephites and the Lamanites were tired from their marches, so they didn’t plan any strategies that night, except Teancum, who was very angry at Ammoron and blamed him and his brother Amalickiah for the prolonged war and suffering.
In his anger, Teancum snuck into the Lamanite camp, lowering himself over the walls. He roamed around until he found the king and threw a javelin at him, hitting him near the heart. However, the king woke his servants before he died, so they chased and killed Teancum.
When Lehi and Moroni learned that Teancum had died, they were deeply saddened because he had bravely fought for their freedom and had endured many hardships. But he was dead and had gone the way of all earthly beings.
The next day, Moroni marched out and attacked the Lamanites, resulting in a great slaughter. They expelled the Lamanites from the land, forcing them to flee without returning to attack the Nephites.
Thus ended the thirty-first year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites, a year marked by war, bloodshed, famine, and suffering.
There had been killings, disputes, and all sorts of wickedness among the Nephites; however, they were spared for the sake of the righteous, thanks to their prayers.
But the long war between the Nephites and the Lamanites had hardened many hearts, while others had softened and humbled themselves before God due to suffering.
After Moroni strengthened the most vulnerable parts of the land against the Lamanites, he returned to Zarahemla, and Helaman went back to his inheritance; peace was restored among the Nephites.
Moroni handed command of his armies to his son, Moronihah, and retired to his home to live the rest of his days in peace.
Pahoran resumed his position as judge, and Helaman began preaching the word of God again, as the many wars and conflicts made it vital to reorganize the church.
Therefore, Helaman and his brothers set out and powerfully preached to convince many people of their wrongdoings, leading them to repent and be baptized to the Lord.
They successfully reestablished the church of God throughout the land.
Regulations regarding the law were also reinstated, and judges were appointed again.
The Nephite people began to prosper again, growing in numbers and strength, and becoming very wealthy.
Despite their riches, strength, and prosperity, they weren’t proud; instead, they remembered the Lord and humbled themselves greatly before Him.
They remembered all the great things the Lord had done for them, delivering them from death, imprisonment, and all kinds of suffering, saving them from their enemies.
They prayed continuously to the Lord, and He blessed them as promised, allowing them to grow strong and prosper in the land.
Thus, everything happened as described, and Helaman died in the thirty-fifth year of the judges’ reign over the Nephites.
