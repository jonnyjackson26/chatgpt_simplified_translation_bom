After Amulek finished speaking, they left the crowd and went to the land of Jershon.
The other brothers, after preaching to the Zoramites, also came to the land of Jershon.
Then the more influential Zoramites got together to discuss the teachings they had heard, and they became angry because the teachings threatened their way of life; so they refused to listen to them.
They sent out messengers to gather all the people and discussed the teachings that had been shared.
The leaders, priests, and teachers kept their true feelings hidden from the people; instead, they quietly learned what everyone was thinking.
After discovering the people's feelings, those who supported Alma's message were expelled from the land; there were many of them, and they also moved to Jershon.
Alma and his companions then helped those who had been expelled.
The Zoramites were furious with the Ammonites living in Jershon, and their wicked leader sent a message to the Ammonites asking them to remove anyone from their land who had come from Zoram.
He threatened them with many harsh words. However, the Ammonites were not afraid and did not cast them out; instead, they welcomed all the poor Zoramites who came to them, provided for their needs, clothed them, and gave them land to live on.
This made the Zoramites even angrier with the Ammonites, and they began to form alliances with the Lamanites to incite them against the Ammonites as well.
Consequently, the Zoramites and the Lamanites started preparing for war against the Ammonites and the Nephites.
This marked the end of the seventeenth year of the judges' rule over the Nephite people.
The Ammonites left Jershon and moved to the land of Melek, making room for Nephite armies to fight against the Lamanites and Zoramites; this initiated a conflict between the Lamanites and Nephites in the eighteenth year of the judges' reign, which will be detailed later.
Alma, Ammon, their companions, and the two sons of Alma returned to Zarahemla after helping many Zoramites repent; those who repented were driven from their land but received land in Jershon as their inheritance, and they took up arms to protect themselves, their families, and their land.
Alma was troubled by the wickedness of his people, the wars, the violence, and the disputes among them; he had been sent to preach in every city and saw that the people's hearts were hardening, and they were becoming offended by the strict teachings; this made him very sad.
So, he gathered his sons together to give each of them specific guidance on matters of righteousness, and we have a record of the instructions he provided to them.
