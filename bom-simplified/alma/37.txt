My son Helaman, I instruct you to take the records that have been given to me.
I also instruct you to keep a record of this people, just like I have done, on the plates of Nephi, and to keep all these things sacred, as I have kept them; for there is a wise reason for preserving them.
These brass plates contain engravings of the holy scriptures and the genealogy of our ancestors from the very beginning.
Our ancestors prophesied that these records should be preserved and passed down from generation to generation, protected by the Lord until they are shared with every nation, people, and language, so they may understand the mysteries written upon them.
Truly, if these records are maintained, they must shine brightly; yes, they will stay bright, and all the plates that hold holy scripture will do the same.
You might think I’m being foolish, but I tell you, small and simple things bring great things to pass; often, small things confound the wise.
The Lord works through means to fulfill His eternal purposes; and by very small things, He can outsmart the wise and assist in saving many souls.
Up to now, it has been wise in God's plan to preserve these records; they have increased the knowledge of this people, convinced many of their errors, and led them back to God for their salvation.
If it weren’t for these records, Ammon and his brothers could not have helped so many thousands of Lamanites see the false traditions of their ancestors; these writings and their messages helped them repent, know the Lord, and rejoice in Jesus Christ as their Savior.
Who knows what impact they might have on saving thousands of Lamanites and even many stubborn Nephites—who are currently hardening their hearts in sin—from realizing who their Redeemer is?
These mysteries are not yet fully revealed to me, so I will refrain from discussing them.
It is enough to say that they are preserved for a wise purpose known only to God, who acts wisely in all He does, and His paths are straightforward and cyclical.
Oh, keep in mind, my son Helaman, how strict God’s commandments are. He said: If you keep my commandments, you will thrive in the land—but if you do not keep them, you will be cut off from my presence.
Remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these sacred things, and He has a wise reason for keeping them sacred, to demonstrate His power to future generations.
If you break God's commandments, these sacred things will be taken from you by His power, and you will be handed over to Satan, who will test you like chaff blown by the wind.
However, if you keep God’s commandments and handle these sacred things as the Lord directs you, appealing to Him for guidance in all matters, no earthly or hellish power can take them from you, for God is powerful enough to fulfill all His promises.
He will keep all His promises to you, for He has already fulfilled promises made to our ancestors.
He promised to preserve these things for a wise reason in Him, to show His power to future generations.
Now, He has fulfilled one purpose by restoring many thousands of Lamanites to the truth; He has demonstrated His power with them and will continue to do so for future generations; therefore, they will be preserved.
I urge you, my son Helaman, to be diligent in following my words, and to diligently keep God's commandments as written.
Now, I want to discuss the twenty-four plates; you must keep them safe so that the mysteries and dark deeds of those who have been destroyed can be revealed to this people; all their murders, thefts, and wickedness must be made known so that you preserve these interpreters.
The Lord saw that His people began to engage in secret darkness, murders, and horrible sins; He warned them that if they did not repent, they would be destroyed from the earth.
The Lord said: I will prepare a stone for my servant Gazelem that will shine in darkness to show my faithful people what their brethren are doing in secret, as well as their dark works and wickedness.
Now, my son, these interpreters were made so God’s word could be fulfilled, which said: 
I will bring all their secret works and abominations out of darkness; unless they repent, I will destroy them from the earth; and I will reveal all their hidden secrets and wickedness to every nation that will inherit the land.
And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; thus they have been destroyed, and so far, God’s word has been fulfilled; their hidden sins have been exposed.
I command you to keep their oaths, covenants, and agreements concerning their secret abominations; keep all their signs and wonders from the people so they do not learn them, lest they fall into darkness and be destroyed as well.
There is a curse on this land that destruction will come upon all workers of darkness when they are fully ripe; therefore, I hope this people are not destroyed.
Keep the secret plans of their oaths and agreements from this people; only reveal their wickedness, murders, and abominations; teach them to hate such wickedness, and inform them that those who were destroyed did so because of their sins and murders.
They murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came to warn them of their wrongdoings; the blood of those they killed cried out to the Lord for vengeance; and thus the judgments of God fell upon these workers of darkness and secret combinations.
Cursed be the land forever for these workers of darkness and secret combinations, unto destruction, unless they repent before they reach the point of no return.
Now, my son, remember what I've told you; do not trust the secret plans of this people, but teach them a lasting hatred for sin and wrongdoing.
Teach them repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to be humble and gentle; teach them to resist every temptation of the devil by having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Encourage them to never lose enthusiasm for doing good, but to remain humble and gentle; for those who do will find peace for their souls.
Oh, remember, my son, and gain wisdom while you are young; learn to keep God’s commandments early on.
Cry out to God for all your needs; let everything you do be for the Lord, and wherever you go, do so in the Lord; let your thoughts be focused on the Lord, and keep your heart devoted to Him forever.
Consult the Lord in all your actions, and He will guide you for good; when you go to bed, rest in the Lord’s care; when you get up in the morning, be full of gratitude to God; if you do these things, you will be uplifted in the end.
I also want to mention the thing our ancestors called a ball or director— what they called Liahona, which means compass; the Lord prepared it.
No one can craft such intricate work as this. It was made to show our ancestors the way they should travel in the wilderness.
It worked for them according to their faith in God; if they believed that God could guide them with those spindles, then it happened; they experienced this miracle every day.
However, because these miracles came from small means, they began to overlook their faith and diligence, and those marvelous signs ceased; they didn’t progress in their journey.
As a result, they lingered in the wilderness, unable to travel directly and suffering from hunger and thirst because of their wrongdoings.
Now, my son, understand that these things have a deeper meaning; just as our ancestors were lazy in paying attention to their compass (which were temporary things), they did not succeed; the same holds true for spiritual matters.
It is just as simple to heed the word of Christ, which shows a path to eternal happiness, as it was for our ancestors to follow the compass towards the promised land.
I ask you, is there a lesson here? Just as this compass guided our ancestors to the promised land, if we follow Christ's words, they will lead us away from this troubled life to a much better promised land.
Oh, my son, do not be idle just because the path is easy; our ancestors had the same chance; it was set up for them so if they looked, they would live; the same is true for us. The way is prepared, and if we look to God, we can have eternal life.
Lastly, my son, make sure to take care of these sacred things; look to God and live. Go to this people, share the word, and stay serious. Farewell, my son.
