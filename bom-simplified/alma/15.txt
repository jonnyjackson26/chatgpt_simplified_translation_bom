Alma and Amulek were told to leave the city, so they went to the land of Sidom and found the people who had fled from Ammonihah. These people had been cast out and mistreated for believing in Alma's teachings.
They shared with the people everything that had happened to their families and themselves, along with their experiences of being saved.
At the same time, Zeezrom was very ill in Sidom due to a high fever caused by his troubled mind, which was filled with guilt for his wickedness. He feared that Alma and Amulek were dead because of his sins, and this filled him with torment.
When he learned that Alma and Amulek were in Sidom, he felt hopeful and quickly sent for them, asking them to come to him.
Alma and Amulek went right away to Zeezrom's house, where they found him on his sickbed, suffering from a fever and troubled by guilt. When Zeezrom saw them, he reached out and pleaded with them to heal him.
Alma asked Zeezrom if he believed in the healing power of Christ.
Zeezrom replied that he believed everything that Alma had taught him.
Alma then told him that if he believed in Christ's redemption, he could be healed.
Zeezrom confirmed that he believed in what Alma had said.
Alma then prayed to the Lord, asking for mercy and healing for Zeezrom, according to his faith in Christ.
After Alma prayed, Zeezrom stood up and began to walk, which amazed everyone around, and news of this miracle spread throughout Sidom.
Alma baptized Zeezrom in the name of the Lord, and from that moment on, Zeezrom began preaching to the people.
Alma founded a church in Sidom and appointed priests and teachers to baptize anyone who wanted to be baptized.
Many people came from the surrounding areas and got baptized.
In contrast, the people in Ammonihah remained stubborn and unrepentant, attributing Alma and Amulek's power to the devil. They followed the teachings of Nehor and rejected repentance.
Alma and Amulek moved on, with Amulek having given up all his wealth and possessions in Ammonihah for the sake of God's word, having been shunned by his friends, family, and father.
After establishing the church in Sidom, Alma noticed the people starting to repent and humble themselves before God. They assembled regularly to worship at their sanctuaries, praying for deliverance from evil and death.
Seeing all these changes, Alma took Amulek to the land of Zarahemla, brought him to his home, and cared for him during his struggles, encouraging him in the Lord.
This concluded the tenth year of the judges' reign over the Nephite people.
