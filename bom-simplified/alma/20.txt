After establishing a church in that land, King Lamoni wanted Ammon to accompany him to the land of Nephi to meet his father.
Then the Lord spoke to Ammon, warning him not to go to Nephi, as the king there would seek to kill him. Instead, he should go to Middoni, where Ammon's brother Aaron, along with Muloki and Ammah, were imprisoned.
When Ammon heard this, he told Lamoni that his brother and companions were in prison at Middoni and that he intended to rescue them.
Lamoni replied that he believed Ammon could achieve anything through the Lord's strength. However, he wanted to go with Ammon to Middoni, as the king there, named Antiomno, was his friend. Lamoni thought he could persuade this king to release Ammon’s brothers. He then asked Ammon how he knew his brothers were imprisoned.
Ammon responded that no one told him except God, who instructed him to go and free his brothers from prison in Middoni.
Upon hearing this, Lamoni commanded his servants to prepare horses and chariots for their journey.
Lamoni then told Ammon he would accompany him to Middoni, where he would appeal to the king to release Ammon's brothers from jail.
As Ammon and Lamoni traveled, they encountered Lamoni's father, the king over all the land.
Lamoni’s father asked him why he hadn't attended the feast he had prepared for his sons and people on that important day.
He also questioned why Lamoni was traveling with Ammon, whom he referred to as "one of the children of a liar."
Lamoni explained where he was going, as he was hesitant to upset his father.
He also explained why he had delayed in his own kingdom and why he missed the feast.
After hearing this, Lamoni’s father became angry and said: "Lamoni, you plan to rescue these Nephites, who are sons of a liar. Remember, he robbed our ancestors; now his children have come among us to deceive and rob us again."
The king commanded Lamoni to kill Ammon and ordered him to return with him to Ishmael.
But Lamoni responded: "I will not kill Ammon, nor will I return to Ishmael. I’m going to Middoni to release Ammon's brothers because I know they are righteous men and holy prophets of the true God."
When the king heard this, he became furious and drew his sword, intending to strike Lamoni down.
Ammon then stepped forward and said: "You shall not kill your son; however, it’s better for him to die than for you to act in anger, for he has repented of his sins. If you fall in your rage, your soul could be lost."
He continued, saying: "It is wise for you to hold back; if you kill your son, an innocent man, his blood will cry out to God for vengeance against you, and you might lose your soul."
After Ammon said this, the king replied he realized that killing his son would mean shedding innocent blood, and he acknowledged that he was the one trying to destroy Ammon.
Then the king reached out his hand to kill Ammon. However, Ammon defended himself and struck the king’s arm, rendering it useless.
Seeing that Ammon could overpower him, the king began to plead for his life.
Ammon raised his sword and told him: "I will strike you down unless you agree to set my brothers free from prison."
Fearing for his life, the king responded: "If you spare me, I will grant you whatever you ask for, even half of my kingdom."
When Ammon realized he had gained leverage over the king, he said: "If you agree to let my brothers out of prison, allow Lamoni to keep his kingdom, and don’t be upset with him, then I will spare you. Otherwise, I will strike you down."
Upon hearing this, the king felt relieved because he had been granted a second chance at life.
When the king noticed that Ammon didn’t want to harm him and saw the deep love he had for his son Lamoni, he was incredibly astonished and said: "Since all you want is for me to free your brothers and allow Lamoni to keep his kingdom, I will grant this request from now on; I will no longer govern him."
He also agreed that Ammon's brothers could be released from prison and promised that both Ammon and his brothers could come to his kingdom, as he looked forward to seeing them. The king was greatly surprised by the words spoken by both Ammon and Lamoni, and he was eager to hear more.
Ammon and Lamoni then continued on their way to Middoni, and Lamoni found favor with the king of that land, resulting in Ammon's brothers being brought out of prison. 
When Ammon reunited with them, he was deeply saddened to see they were naked and had suffered greatly from being bound with strong cords. They had endured hunger, thirst, and various hardships, yet they remained patient throughout their trials.
Unfortunately, they had fallen into the hands of a cruel and stubborn people who refused to listen to their words. They had been driven from place to place, mistreated, and ultimately imprisoned in Middoni, where they were held for many days before being freed by Lamoni and Ammon.
