After the end of the story of Korihor, Alma learned that the Zoramites were straying from the ways of the Lord, and that their leader Zoram was leading them to worship worthless idols. This troubled Alma deeply because he was saddened by the wrongdoing of the people.
It caused Alma great sorrow to know that there was wrongdoing among his people; thus, he felt especially sad about how the Zoramites had separated themselves from the Nephites.
The Zoramites had come together in a land they called Antionum, located east of Zarahemla, near the seashore, which was south of Jershon, an area bordering a wilderness populated by the Lamanites.
The Nephites feared that the Zoramites might start communicating with the Lamanites, which could cause significant problems for them.
Alma knew that preaching the word was effective at encouraging good behavior among people – it had a stronger impact on their minds than weapons or anything else. So he decided it was important to try using the word of God.
He took Ammon, Aaron, and Omner with him; he left Himni in the church at Zarahemla. Along with the three, he also brought Amulek and Zeezrom from Melek, as well as two of his sons.
He did not take his eldest son, Helaman, but he did take Shiblon and Corianton, and these were the ones who went with him to preach to the Zoramites.
The Zoramites were separated from the Nephites, so they had already heard the teachings of God.
However, they had strayed into serious mistakes, as they refused to follow God's commandments and the laws given through Moses.
They also ignored the importance of regularly praying and seeking God’s guidance to avoid temptation.
In short, they had corrupted the ways of the Lord in many ways, which is why Alma and his companions went to preach to them.
When they arrived in the land, they were amazed to find that the Zoramites had built synagogues where they gathered once a week, which they called the Lord's Day, to worship in a manner that Alma and his companions had never witnessed before.
They had constructed a platform in the center of their synagogue that was raised above the ground, allowing only one person at a time to stand on it.
Therefore, anyone wanting to worship had to step onto this platform, raise their hands toward heaven, and loudly proclaim:
Holy, holy God; we believe you are God, and that you are holy, and that you were a spirit, are a spirit, and will always be a spirit.
Holy God, we believe you have set us apart from our brothers; we don't accept the traditions passed down to them by their foolish ancestors; instead, we believe you have chosen us as your holy children, and you have revealed to us that there will be no Christ.
You are unchanging, and you have chosen us for salvation while everyone else is destined for damnation; for this we thank you, God; we also thank you for keeping us from following the foolish traditions of our brothers that lead them to believe in Christ, pulling their hearts away from you, our God.
Once again, we express our gratitude that we are a chosen and holy people. Amen.
After Alma and his companions heard these prayers, they were completely astonished.
Every individual among them repeated the exact same prayers.
They referred to this platform as Rameumptom, which means the holy stand.
From this stand, every person offered the same prayer to God, thanking Him for selecting them and for steering them away from the traditions of their brothers, ensuring their hearts didn't stray toward beliefs they didn't understand.
After everyone thanked God in this way, they returned home, not mentioning God again until they gathered once more at the holy stand to offer thanks in their usual way.
When Alma saw this, he felt deep sorrow; he realized they were wicked and corrupt people, focused on wealth and material possessions.
He also noticed their pride and arrogance.
He lifted his voice to God, crying out: O Lord, how long will you allow your servants to live among such terrible wickedness among humanity?
Look, O God, they call on you, yet their hearts are consumed by pride. They pray to you while exalting themselves with the empty things of this world.
Behold, O my God, their expensive clothing, fancy hairstyles, jewelry, and precious items; their hearts are set on them, and still they call out to you, saying—We thank you, O God, for we are chosen people, while others will be lost.
Moreover, they claim you have informed them that there will be no Christ.
O Lord God, how long will you tolerate such evil and disbelief among them? Please grant me the strength to endure my weaknesses. I am weak, and witnessing this wickedness pains my soul.
O Lord, my heart is filled with sorrow; please comfort my soul in Christ. O Lord, give me strength to patiently endure the trials that will come to me because of the sins of this people.
O Lord, comfort my soul, and grant us success, including Ammon, Aaron, Omner, Amulek, Zeezrom, and my two sons—please provide comfort for all of us, O Lord. Yes, comfort their souls in Christ.
Please give them strength so they can endure the trials coming their way due to these people's sins.
O Lord, grant us success in bringing them back to you in Christ.
Look, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many are our brothers; therefore, grant us power and wisdom to bring these, our brothers, back to you.
After Alma said this, he laid his hands on all his companions. As he did so, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.
Afterward, they separated from one another, not worrying about what they would eat or drink, or what they would wear.
The Lord provided for them so they did not hunger or thirst; he also gave them strength to withstand all trials, allowing them to find joy in Christ. This happened because Alma prayed earnestly and believed.
