Kings come and go—Some are good, some are bad—When good leadership is in place, the people are blessed and flourish from the Lord's blessings.
Shez, a descendant of Heth—who had died in a famine along with his family, except for Shez—began to rebuild a people who had lost hope.
Shez remembered the downfall of his ancestors and established a good kingdom; he recalled how the Lord helped Jared and his brother cross the ocean, and he followed the Lord’s path, having sons and daughters.
His oldest son, also named Shez, rebelled against him; however, this Shez was attacked by a thief due to his great wealth, which eventually restored peace to his father.
His father built many cities across the land, and the people began to scatter once more. Shez lived to an old age and had a son named Riplakish. After his death, Riplakish became king.
Riplakish did not follow the Lord's ways; he had many wives and concubines, and he imposed heavy burdens on his people, unfairly taxing them to build extravagant structures.
He created a beautifully ornate throne and constructed many prisons. Anyone who refused to pay taxes or couldn’t afford them was imprisoned, made to work continuously to support themselves; those who didn’t work were put to death.
As a result, he extracted all kinds of valuable resources, including gold, from the prisoners; he forced them to create fine artworks while oppressing them with his immoral actions.
After ruling for forty-two years, the people revolted against Riplakish, leading to war in the land, resulting in Riplakish's death and the exile of his family.
Many years later, Morianton, a descendant of Riplakish, gathered a group of outcasts and fought the people, gaining control over several cities. The war became fierce and lasted many years, eventually allowing him to rule over all the land.
Once he established his kingship, he lightened the people's burdens, earning their favor, and they anointed him as their king.
He administered justice to the people, though not to himself because of his many sins; as a result, he was cut off from the Lord’s presence.
Morianton built many cities, and the people thrived during his reign, accumulating wealth in buildings, gold, silver, crops, livestock, and restoring their resources.
Morianton lived to a very old age and had a son named Kim, who took over as king and reigned for eight years before his father's death. Kim did not rule righteously and therefore was not favored by the Lord.
His brother rebelled against him, capturing him; he remained imprisoned for the rest of his life, having children in captivity, including Levi, before he died.
Levi served in captivity for forty-two years after his father’s death. He waged war against the king of the land and eventually claimed the throne for himself.
Once he had the kingdom, he followed the Lord’s commandments; the people prospered under his rule. He lived to a good old age, had children, and appointed Corom as king in his place.
Corom did what was right in the Lord’s eyes throughout his life, having many children. After many years, he passed away, just like everyone else, with Kish taking over as king.
Kish also passed away, and Lib ascended to the throne.
Lib acted righteously in the Lord’s sight, and during his reign, poisonous snakes were eliminated. As a result, they ventured south to hunt food for the people because the land was full of game. Lib became a skilled hunter himself.
They constructed a large city near the narrow strip of land where the sea separates the land.
They kept the southern land as a wilderness for hunting. The northern land was densely populated.
The people worked hard, buying, selling, and trading with one another for profit.
They mined different ores and produced gold, silver, iron, brass, and other metals; they dug deep into the earth, creating large mounds to access their resources, including gold, silver, iron, and copper, and they crafted fine goods.
They had silks and fine linen, making various types of clothing to cover themselves.
They created tools for farming, including plows and sickles for harvesting.
They also made tools for caring for their animals.
They developed various weapons for war and ingeniously crafted intricate works of art.
No people could be more blessed than they were, prospered by the Lord’s grace. They lived in a land better than any other, for the Lord had declared it so.
Lib lived many years, fathered children, and had a son named Hearthom.
Hearthom succeeded his father as king. After twenty-four years, his kingdom was taken from him, and he was held captive for the rest of his life.
He had a son named Heth, who remained in captivity his entire life. Heth fathered Aaron, who also lived in captivity all his days, and Aaron had a son named Amnigaddah, who also continued in captivity, followed by Coriantum, who too was held captive for his whole life, and then Com.
Com took control of half the kingdom and reigned for forty-two years. He fought against King Amgid, battling for many years, during which Com defeated Amgid and reclaimed the rest of the kingdom.
During Com's reign, robbers emerged in the land, reviving old schemes, taking oaths like in ancient times, and trying to destroy the kingdom.
Com fought against them vigorously, but despite his efforts, he was unable to defeat them.
