The wrongdoing of the people causes a curse on the land—Coriantumr goes to war against Gilead, then Lib, and finally Shiz—Blood and violence fill the land.
Because of the people's wrongdoing, a terrible curse fell on the land. If someone put down their tool or sword, they would not be able to find it the next day, as the curse was so severe.
As a result, everyone clung tightly to their possessions and refused to borrow or lend anything. Each person kept their sword ready in their hand to protect their property, life, and family.
After two years and the death of Shared, Shared's brother arose and fought Coriantumr, who defeated him and chased him into the wilderness of Akish.
Shared's brother battled Coriantumr in the wilderness, and the fighting was intense, with many thousands being killed.
Coriantumr laid siege to the wilderness, but Shared's brother snuck out at night and attacked part of Coriantumr's army, who were drunk.
He then went to the land of Moron and took the throne of Coriantumr for himself.
Coriantumr stayed with his army in the wilderness for two years, gathering great strength for his forces.
Shared's brother, named Gilead, also strengthened his army through secret alliances.
However, during this time, his high priest killed him while he was sitting on his throne.
Then one of these secret groups killed him quietly and took control of the kingdom. His name was Lib, and he was a very tall man, larger than anyone else among the people.
In the first year of Lib's reign, Coriantumr came to Moron and fought against Lib.
During their fight, Lib injured Coriantumr’s arm, but Coriantumr’s army continued to press him until Lib fled to the edges of the seashore.
Coriantumr pursued Lib, and they fought again at the seashore.
Lib defeated Coriantumr’s army, forcing them to retreat back to the wilderness of Akish.
Lib chased Coriantumr until they reached the plains of Agosh. During this retreat, Coriantumr took all his people with him.
At the plains of Agosh, Coriantumr fought Lib and managed to kill him, but Lib's brother attacked Coriantumr in his place, leading to an even fiercer battle that made Coriantumr flee once more.
The name of Lib's brother was Shiz. As he pursued Coriantumr, he destroyed many cities and killed both women and children while burning everything down.
Fear of Shiz spread across the land, and people cried out—Who can stand up to the army of Shiz? He sweeps everything away!
People began to gather in armies across the land.
They were divided: some joined Shiz's army, while others joined Coriantumr's.
The war had been so fierce and long that the land was covered with the bodies of the dead.
The fighting was so rapid and intense that no one was left to bury the dead. They moved from one battle to another, leaving bodies of men, women, and children lying everywhere for the worms to consume.
The stench of death filled the land, causing the people to feel disturbed both day and night.
Still, Shiz continued to pursue Coriantumr, driven by a vow to avenge his brother's death and by the word from the Lord that Coriantumr would not be killed.
This shows how the Lord punished them for their sins, as their wickedness led directly to their eventual destruction.
Shiz chased Coriantumr eastward to the coast, where they fought for three days.
The destruction on Shiz's side was so terrible that his troops began to panic and ran from Coriantumr’s forces, retreating to the land of Corihor and driving out its inhabitants.
They set up their camps in the valley of Corihor, while Coriantumr camped in the valley of Shurr, which was next to the hill Comnor. Coriantumr gathered his armies there and blew a trumpet to challenge Shiz to battle.
Shiz's forces came out to fight but were pushed back. They tried again and were repelled a second time. When they came out for a third time, the battle became very fierce.
In that fight, Shiz struck Coriantumr, inflicting many serious wounds, and Coriantumr fainted from blood loss, appearing to be dead.
The toll of the battle had been so severe on both sides that Shiz instructed his men not to chase after Coriantumr, and they returned to their camp instead.
