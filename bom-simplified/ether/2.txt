Jared, his brother, their families, and their friends went down into the northern valley called Nimrod, named after a great hunter, bringing all their livestock, both male and female, of every kind.
They set traps and caught birds, and they also prepared a container to carry fish from the waters.
They brought honey bees with them, as deseret means honey bee in translation, and took swarms of bees along with various seeds from the land.
When they arrived in the valley of Nimrod, the Lord came down and spoke to the brother of Jared; He was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared could not see Him.
The Lord instructed them to travel into the wilderness, to a place where no man had been before. The Lord guided them and spoke with them while standing in a cloud, showing them where to go.
They traveled through the wilderness and built barges to cross many waters, continuously guided by the Lord.
The Lord did not allow them to stop beyond the sea in the wilderness; He wanted them to reach the promised land, which was more precious than any other land, reserved by God for a righteous people.
He had sworn to the brother of Jared that whoever possessed this promised land would need to serve Him, the true God, or they would be removed when His full wrath came upon them.
Now we understand God's decrees regarding this land: it is a promised land, and any nation that possesses it must serve God; otherwise, they will be removed when His full wrath arrives, which happens when they are fully corrupt.
This is a treasured land above all others; thus, whoever possesses it must serve God or be removed, as is God's eternal decree. They will only be removed when their wickedness is at its peak.
This message is for you, Gentiles, so you may understand God's decrees—repent and do not continue in your sins until it’s too late, so you do not invoke God's full wrath as others in the land have previously done.
This is a choice land, and any nation that possesses it will be free from bondage and captivity from other nations under heaven, as long as they serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, as we have recorded.
Now I continue with my account; the Lord brought Jared and his brethren to the great sea that separates the lands. When they arrived, they set up their tents and named the place Moriancumer, living in tents on the seashore for four years.
At the end of four years, the Lord came again to the brother of Jared, standing in a cloud and conversing with him. The Lord spoke to him for three hours, correcting him for forgetting to call upon His name.
The brother of Jared repented of his wrongs and prayed for his brethren. The Lord responded that He would forgive them, but they must not sin again, reminding him that His Spirit would not always strive with man. If they continued to sin until they were completely wicked, they would be cut off from His presence. He shared His thoughts about the land He would give them, stating it would be especially choice.
The Lord instructed them to build barges like those they had constructed before. The brother of Jared and his brethren began building the barges as the Lord instructed, making them small and light, floating on the water like a bird.
They built the barges so tightly that they would hold water like a bowl; the bottom was tight like a bowl; the sides were tight like a bowl; the ends came to a point; the top was tight like a bowl; and their length was like that of a tree; when the door was shut, it was tight like a bowl.
The brother of Jared then prayed to the Lord, saying he had finished the work commanded of him, and he made the barges as directed.
However, he pointed out that the barges had no light; where would they steer? Also, they were at risk of perishing since they could not breathe without air in them.
The Lord replied, telling the brother of Jared to make a hole at the top and bottom; when they needed air, they could open the hole. If water started to enter, they should block the hole to avoid drowning.
The brother of Jared did as the Lord commanded.
He prayed again, saying he had followed the Lord's instructions, but there was no light in the vessels. He asked if they would cross the great water in darkness.
The Lord asked what the brother of Jared wanted to do to provide light in their vessels, explaining that they couldn’t have windows as they would break, nor could they take fire with them, since they would not be guided by firelight.
He explained that they would be like a whale in the sea, buffeted by the waves. However, He would lift them from the depths of the sea because He had sent forth the winds and the rains and floods.
The Lord assured him that He was preparing them for these challenges; they wouldn’t be able to cross the deep unless He equipped them against the waves, winds, and floods. Therefore, He asked what the brother of Jared wanted Him to prepare so they could have light while they were submerged in the depths of the sea.
