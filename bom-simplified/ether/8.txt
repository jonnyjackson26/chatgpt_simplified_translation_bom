There is conflict and fighting over the rule of the kingdom—Akish creates a secret group bound by oaths to kill the king—These secret groups come from the devil and lead to the downfall of nations—People today are warned about such secret groups that aim to take away freedom from all lands and nations.
So, Omer had a son named Omer, who took over as king. Omer had a son named Jared, and Jared also had sons and daughters.
Jared turned against his father and moved to the land of Heth. He flattered many with his clever words until he took control of half the kingdom.
Once he had taken control of half the kingdom, he fought against his father, captured him, and made him serve as a prisoner.
During Omer's reign, he spent half his life in captivity. He had sons and daughters, including Esrom and Coriantumr.
They were very angry about what their brother Jared had done, so they created an army and attacked Jared at night.
After they defeated Jared's army, they were ready to kill him too; he begged them not to, offering to give the kingdom back to his father. They let him live.
Jared felt very sad about losing the kingdom because he had been focused on it and the glory that came with it.
Jared's daughter, who was very clever and noticed her father's sadness, thought of a way to bring the kingdom back to him.
She was very beautiful and spoke to her father, asking him why he was so sad. She reminded him that they had records from their ancestors who had gained kingdoms and glory through secret plans.
She suggested that her father should invite Akish, the son of Kimnor, and she would dance for him to win his favor; then, if he wanted her as his wife, her father should say: I will give her to you if you bring me my father's head.
Omer was friendly with Akish; when Jared sent for Akish, his daughter danced for him and pleased him, so he wanted her as his wife. He then asked Jared for her.
Jared replied that he would give her to him if he would bring him the head of his father, the king.
Akish then gathered all his relatives and asked them to swear loyalty to him for what he would ask of them.
They all promised him by the God of heaven and everything else, that anyone who did not support Akish would lose their head, and anyone who revealed his plans would lose their life.
So they agreed to Akish’s terms. Akish had them take oaths like those taken long ago by others who sought power, which were passed down since Cain, the first murderer.
These oaths were supported by the devil’s power, keeping people in darkness, allowing those who sought power to gain it through murder, theft, lies, and all kinds of wickedness.
Jared's daughter inspired him to look into these ancient practices, and Jared influenced Akish, who then shared these ideas with his family and friends, leading them away with enticing promises to do whatever he wished.
They formed a secret group, just like those from the past; this kind of group is the most wicked and detestable in God's eyes.
God does not work through secret groups, nor does he want people to shed blood; he has forbidden it since the beginning of humanity.
Now, I, Moroni, won't describe the details of their oaths and alliances, since I know they exist among all people, including the Lamanites.
These secret groups have led to the destruction of the people I’m talking about, as well as the downfall of the Nephites.
Any nation that supports such secret groups to gain power and wealth will face destruction; God will not allow the blood of his faithful to continue crying out for justice from the ground without taking action.
Therefore, you Gentiles, it is wise in God's plan for you to be shown these things so you can repent of your sins and not let these murderous groups rise to power over you. If you do, the execution of justice by God will come upon you, leading to your destruction.
So, the Lord commands you, when you see these things emerging among you, to wake up to your terrible situation because of this secret group; woe to it because of the blood of those who have been killed; they call from the dust for vengeance against it and those who support it.
Whoever creates such a group aims to destroy the freedom of lands and nations, leading to the downfall of all people because it is built by the devil, the father of lies; the same deceiver who misled our first parents and who incited murder from the start; who has made men’s hearts hard so they have killed prophets, stoned them, and cast them out since the beginning.
Thus, I, Moroni, am instructed to write these things to eliminate evil, so the time will come when Satan will have no power over humanity’s hearts, and that they will be inspired to continually do good, turning toward the source of all righteousness and being saved.
