Moroni continues to write about the downfall of the people he has been discussing.
They ignored everything Ether said; he had truthfully told them all things, starting from the creation of mankind, that after the floods receded, this land became the most important land, a special land chosen by God, where everyone living there should serve Him.
This land was also the future site of the New Jerusalem, which would descend from heaven and be the sacred dwelling place of God.
Ether foresaw the time of Christ and spoke about the New Jerusalem that would be established on this land.
He also talked about the house of Israel and the Jerusalem that Lehi was from—after it was destroyed, it would be rebuilt as a holy city dedicated to God; thus, it couldn’t be considered a new Jerusalem since it once existed but would be restored and become a holy city for Israel.
A New Jerusalem would be built on this land for the remaining descendants of Joseph, serving as a symbol for what was to come.
Just as Joseph took his father to Egypt, he also died there; therefore, God brought away a remnant of Joseph's descendants from Jerusalem so that they wouldn't be lost, demonstrating mercy just as He did for Joseph's father.
Thus, the remaining descendants of Joseph will inhabit this land as their inheritance, and they will build a holy city for God that will resemble the ancient Jerusalem; and they will no longer face confusion until the world ends.
Then there will be a new heaven and a new earth, which will be similar to the old, except that the old will have disappeared, and everything will become new.
At that point, the New Jerusalem will come, and those who live there will be blessed, for their clothes will be made pure through the sacrifice of the Lamb, and they will be counted among the descendants of Joseph from Israel.
Then the original Jerusalem will also be restored, and its inhabitants will be blessed; they will have been made pure through the Lamb's sacrifice, and they will be gathered from all corners of the earth, fulfilling God's promise to their ancestor, Abraham.
When these events happen, it will confirm the scriptures that say those who were first shall be last, and those who were last shall be first.
I was about to write additional things, but I was not allowed; Ether's prophecies were extraordinary, but the people regarded him as worthless and cast him out; he then hid in a rock by day and watched the events that would unfold for the people at night.
While he was hiding in the rock, he completed his record, witnessing the destructions that befell the people during the night.
That same year, after he was expelled from society, a great war broke out among the people, as many powerful individuals rose up to destroy Coriantumr through their secret plans of evil.
Coriantumr, trained in all military tactics and worldly cunning, fought against those who sought to kill him.
However, neither he, nor his handsome sons and daughters, nor the attractive children of Cohor, nor the beautiful children of Corihor showed any sign of repentance; in fact, there were no attractive sons and daughters anywhere who repented for their sins.
As a result, during the first year that Ether was hiding in the rock, many people were killed by the sword of these secret combinations fighting against Coriantumr in hopes of taking over the kingdom.
The sons of Coriantumr fought fiercely and suffered many wounds.
In the second year, God instructed Ether to go and tell Coriantumr that if he repented, along with his family, God would restore his kingdom and save the people—
Otherwise, they would be destroyed, with only Coriantumr surviving to witness the prophecies about another group receiving the land as their inheritance. Coriantumr would be buried by them, and everyone else would perish except for him.
Coriantumr did not repent, nor did his family, nor did the people; the wars continued, and they sought to kill Ether, but he escaped and hid once again in the rock.
Then Shared rose up and fought Coriantumr, defeating him and capturing him in the third year.
In the fourth year, the sons of Coriantumr fought Shared and reclaimed the kingdom for their father.
A war spread across the entire land with every man and his group fighting for what they wanted.
Robbers and all kinds of wickedness were rampant throughout the land.
Coriantumr was extremely angry with Shared and went to battle against him with his army; they clashed with intense fury in the valley of Gilgal, leading to a very ferocious battle.
Shared fought against Coriantumr for three days. Eventually, Coriantumr defeated him and chased him to the plains of Heshlon.
On the plains, Shared engaged Coriantumr in battle again, this time defeating him and driving him back to the valley of Gilgal.
Once again, Coriantumr fought Shared in the valley of Gilgal, where he defeated and killed Shared.
Shared inflicted a wound on Coriantumr's thigh, which kept him from fighting for two years, during which period bloodshed covered the land, with no one to stop it.
