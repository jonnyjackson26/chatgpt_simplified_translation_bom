During the time of Ether, Coriantumr was the king over the entire land.  
Ether was a prophet sent by the Lord, and during Coriantumr's reign, he began to preach to the people, feeling compelled by the Spirit of the Lord within him.  
He cried out from dawn until sunset, urging the people to believe in God and repent to avoid destruction, explaining that faith is the key to achieving all things.  
Thus, anyone who believes in God can confidently hope for a better life and a place beside Him, as this hope is rooted in faith, acting as an anchor for our souls, helping us to be steadfast and willing to do good, leading to the glorification of God.  
Ether proclaimed amazing and remarkable things to the people, but they didn't believe him because they couldn't see these things themselves.  
Now, I, Moroni, want to discuss these matters; I want to show the world that faith is about believing in things we hope for but cannot see. Therefore, do not argue because you cannot see; a witness comes only after you have tested your faith.  
It was through faith that Christ revealed himself to our ancestors after rising from the dead; He only showed himself to those who had faith in Him; thus, some must have had this faith, as He didn’t reveal himself to everyone.  
However, because of people's faith, He demonstrated His presence to the world, honored His Father’s name, and made a way for others to receive a heavenly gift, giving them hope for the things not yet seen.  
Therefore, you too can hope and receive this gift if you simply have faith.  
Look, it was through faith that those of old were called by God's holy order.  
Thus, the law of Moses was given through faith. However, with the gift of His Son, God has prepared a superior way; and this has been realized through faith.  
Because without faith among humanity, God cannot perform miracles; therefore, He did not reveal himself until after they had faith.  
It was Alma and Amulek's faith that caused the prison to fall to the ground.  
It was Nephi and Lehi’s faith that changed the Lamanites, allowing them to be baptized with fire and the Holy Ghost.  
It was Ammon and his brothers' faith that created a significant miracle among the Lamanites.  
Indeed, everyone who performed miracles did so through faith, whether they lived before or after Christ.  
The three disciples received a promise through faith that they would not experience death, but that promise came only after they demonstrated their faith.  
And no one has performed miracles until after they had faith; so they first believed in the Son of God.  
Many of those who possessed extraordinarily strong faith before Christ came could see beyond the veil and truly observed the things their faith allowed them to envision, and they rejoiced.  
One of these was the brother of Jared, whose faith was so immense that when God pointed His finger, Jared could not hide from seeing it because of the promise he had received through faith.  
After the brother of Jared saw the Lord’s finger, he was granted the ability to see everything because his faith had allowed him to do so; he could no longer remain behind the veil.  
It is by faith that my ancestors received the promise that these revelations would come to their descendants through the Gentiles; this is why the Lord commanded me, even Jesus Christ.  
I said to Him, "Lord, the Gentiles will ridicule these things due to our writing weaknesses; for although You have made us powerful in speech through faith, you haven't made us strong in writing. You gave this people the ability to speak abundantly, through the Holy Ghost You provided them."  
"You have made us able to write very little, given our awkwardness; we aren't as eloquent in writing as was the brother of Jared, for the things he wrote were mighty and vast, making it difficult for mankind to comprehend."  
"You have also provided us with powerful and profound words that we struggle to put down on paper; so, when we write, we become aware of our weaknesses and stumble over how we arrange our words. I fear that the Gentiles will mock us."  
When I had said this, the Lord spoke to me, saying: "Fools may mock, but they will end up mourning; my grace is enough for those who are humble, so they won't take advantage of your weaknesses."  
"If people come to me, I will reveal their weaknesses to them. I give people weaknesses so they might be humble; my grace is sufficient for anyone who humbles themselves before me; if they humble themselves and believe in me, I will turn weak things into strengths for them."  
"Look, I will reveal the weakness of the Gentiles; showing them that faith, hope, and charity lead to me—the source of all righteousness."  
And I, Moroni, after hearing these words, felt comforted and said: "O Lord, may Your righteous will be fulfilled, for I know that You work with humanity according to their faith."  
For the brother of Jared said to Mount Zerin, "Move!"—and it moved. If he had lacked faith, it would not have budged; thus, You act after people have faith.  
This is how you revealed yourself to your disciples; after they had faith and spoke in Your name, You showed yourself to them with great power.  
I also recall that You indicated you have prepared a home for man, yes, even among the mansions of your Father, granting them a greater hope; therefore, man must have hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place You have prepared.  
Again, I remember you saying that You loved the world so much you laid down Your life for it, so You might take it back to prepare a place for the children of men.  
Now I understand that this love You have for humanity is charity; therefore, if people do not have charity, they cannot inherit the home You have prepared in the mansions of Your Father.  
Consequently, by what You have said, I know that if the Gentiles lack charity due to our weaknesses, You will test them, taking away their talents, even what they do have, and giving it to those who have more abundantly.  
I then prayed to the Lord asking Him to grant grace to the Gentiles so that they would have charity.  
The Lord replied: "If they do not have charity, it doesn't concern you; you have been faithful, and thus, your garments will be made clean. Because you acknowledge your weakness, you will find strength, even leading you to the place I have prepared in the mansions of my Father."  
Now I, Moroni, say farewell to the Gentiles, and to my beloved brethren, until we meet at the judgment seat of Christ, where everyone will know that my garments are clean of your blood.  
Then you shall know that I have seen Jesus and talked with Him face to face, and He spoke plainly to me, just as one man speaks to another in his own language about these matters.  
I wrote only a few of these things because I struggle with writing.  
Now, I encourage you to seek this Jesus about whom the prophets and apostles have spoken, so that the grace of God, the Father, along with the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost, which testifies of them, may dwell in you forever. Amen.
