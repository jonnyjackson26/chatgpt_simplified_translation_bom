A huge number of Jaredites died in battle—Shiz and Coriantumr gathered everyone for a fight—The Lord's Spirit stopped guiding them—The whole Jaredite nation was completely destroyed—Only Coriantumr was left.
After Coriantumr healed from his injuries, he recalled what Ether had told him.
He realized that nearly two million of his people had already been killed, and he felt deep sorrow in his heart; indeed, two million strong men had been killed, along with their wives and children.
He started to regret the wrongs he had done; he recalled the words spoken by the prophets and realized they had all come true so far, which made him mourn deeply and he couldn't find comfort.
So he wrote a letter to Shiz, asking him to spare the people, offering to give up the kingdom to save their lives.
When Shiz got his letter, he replied to Coriantumr, saying that if Coriantumr surrendered, he would kill him with his own sword but would spare the people.
But the people did not turn away from their wickedness; Coriantumr’s followers grew angry at Shiz’s followers, and vice versa; therefore, the people of Shiz attacked the people of Coriantumr.
When Coriantumr saw he was losing, he fled once more from Shiz’s forces.
He reached the waters of Ripliancum, which means "large" or "to exceed all;" when they arrived there, they set up their tents, and Shiz did the same nearby; so the next day they prepared for battle.
They fought a very intense battle, where Coriantumr was wounded again and fainted from blood loss.
Coriantumr’s armies pushed against Shiz's forces, forcing them to retreat, and they fled southward, setting up camp in a place called Ogath.
Coriantumr's army pitched their tents by the hill Ramah, the same hill where my father Mormon hid the sacred records.
They gathered everyone left alive on the land, except for Ether.
Ether watched all that was happening; he saw that those loyal to Coriantumr were joining his army, and those loyal to Shiz were joining his.
For four years they worked to gather all the people on the land, trying to bring all possible strength together.
When everyone came together, each group joined their chosen side, bringing their wives and children—men, women, and children were armed for battle with shields, armor, and dressed for war—they marched against each other, fought all day, but neither side won.
When night fell, they were exhausted and returned to their camps; after resting, they cried out in sorrow for their slain, and their wails filled the air with anguish.
The next day, they went into battle again, and it was a day of great terror; however, they still didn't win, and when night came, their cries of mourning filled the air once more.
Coriantumr wrote another letter to Shiz, asking him not to battle again but to take the kingdom and spare the people’s lives.
However, the Spirit of the Lord stopped guiding them, and Satan had fully taken control of the people's hearts; they had become hard-hearted and blind-minded, which led them to destruction; thus, they went into battle once more.
They fought that entire day, and when night came, they rested on their swords.
The next day, they continued fighting until night came.
When night arrived, they were filled with rage, like someone intoxicated with wine; they again rested on their swords.
The following day, they fought again, and by night, everyone except for fifty-two of Coriantumr's men and sixty-nine of Shiz's had been killed.
That night they rested on their swords, then fought again the next day, using all their might with swords and shields throughout the day.
When night came, there were thirty-two from Shiz's side and twenty-seven from Coriantumr's left.
They ate, slept, and prepared for death the next day. They were mighty men in strength.
They fought for three hours and then swooned from blood loss.
When Coriantumr’s men regained enough strength to move, they were about to flee for their lives; but Shiz rose up with his men, vowing in his rage that he would kill Coriantumr or die trying.
So he chased them down, and the next day, they fought again. In the end, all had fallen except Coriantumr and Shiz, and Shiz fainted from blood loss.
When Coriantumr leaned on his sword to rest briefly, he struck Shiz's head off.
After that, Shiz tried to rise but fell; after struggling for breath, he died.
Coriantumr fell to the ground, as if he had no life left.
The Lord spoke to Ether, instructing him to go forth. Ether did so and saw that everything the Lord had said had come true; he finished his record (and I have not written a hundredth part) and hid them in a way that Limhi's people found them.
Now Ether’s last words are these: Whether the Lord wishes me to be taken up to heaven, or to endure what He wills in the flesh, it does not matter, as long as I am saved in God's kingdom. Amen.
