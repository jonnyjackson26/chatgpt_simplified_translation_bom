Three witnesses and the work itself will serve as proof of the truth of the Book of Mormon.
Now, I, Moroni, have written the words that were instructed to me, based on what I remember; and I have shared the things that I have sealed up, so do not attempt to handle them for translation; such an act is not allowed unless, in due time, it is part of God's wisdom.
Look, you may be allowed to show the plates to those who will help bring forth this work;
And three people will be shown them by God's power; thus, they will know for certain that these things are true.
The testimony of three witnesses will establish these truths; and the testimony of these three, combined with this work, will reveal God’s power and His word, which is confirmed by the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost—and all of this will stand as evidence against the world on the last day.
If they repent and turn to the Father in the name of Jesus, they will be welcomed into the kingdom of God.
Now, if I don't have authority regarding these things, you can judge for yourselves; you will know I have authority when you see me, and we will stand before God on the last day. Amen.
