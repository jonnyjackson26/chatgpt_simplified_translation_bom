The Lord told the brother of Jared to come down from the mountain and write what he had seen; these writings were to remain hidden from people until after Christ was crucified. King Mosiah made sure that these writings would not be revealed until Christ showed Himself to His people.
Once Christ had truly revealed Himself to His people, He instructed that these writings should be made known.
However, now all the people have turned away from faith, except for the Lamanites, who have rejected Christâ€™s gospel; because of this, I have been instructed to hide the writings back in the earth.
Look, I have written on these plates exactly what the brother of Jared witnessed; there have never been greater revelations than those shown to him.
Because of this, the Lord has commanded me to write them down, and I have done so. He also told me to seal them up, along with their interpretation, so I have followed His command and sealed the interpreters as well.
The Lord told me that these writings will not be shared with the Gentiles until they repent of their sins and become pure before Him.
On the day they put their faith in Me, like the brother of Jared did, and become sanctified through Me, I will reveal to them all that the brother of Jared saw, including all My revelations, says Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Creator of heaven and earth and everything in it.
Anyone who argues against the word of the Lord will be condemned; anyone who denies these truths will face the same fate, for I will not show them greater things, says Jesus Christ, for I am the one speaking.
At My command, the heavens can be opened or closed; at My word, the earth will shake, and its inhabitants will pass away as if by fire.
Anyone who does not believe My words does not believe My followers; and if you think I do not speak, you will judge for yourselves, for you will know it is I speaking in the last days.
But those who believe My words, I will share My Spirit with them, and they will know and testify to the truth. My Spirit will confirm to them that what I say is true because it inspires goodness in people.
Anything that inspires people to do good comes from Me; good cannot come from any other source. I am the one who guides people toward all that is good; anyone who does not believe My words will not recognize who I am. Likewise, if they do not believe Me, they will not believe in the Father who sent Me. See, I am the Father; I am the light, the life, and the truth of the world.
Come to Me, O Gentiles, and I will reveal to you the greater truths that are hidden because of your lack of faith.
Come to Me, O house of Israel, and you will see how great the blessings the Father has stored up for you since the world's beginning; these blessings haven't reached you due to your unbelief.
Look, when you tear away that barrier of disbelief that keeps you in your terrible state of wickedness and hard-heartedness, then the amazing truths that have been hidden from you will be revealed. Yes, when you call upon the Father in My name, with a sincere heart and humble spirit, you will know that the Father has remembered the promise He made to your ancestors, O house of Israel.
Then all the revelations I had John write down will be shown to all the people. Remember, when you see these events unfold, you will know that the time has come for them to be revealed.
So, when you receive this record, you can understand that the Father's work has begun across the entire earth.
Therefore, repent all you nations, come to Me, believe in My gospel, and be baptized in My name; whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned, and signs will follow those who believe in My name.
Blessed is the one who is faithful to My name at the end, for they will be taken up to live in the kingdom prepared for them since the beginning of the world. And know that it is I who has said this. Amen.
