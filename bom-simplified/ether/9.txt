The kingdom is taken over through inheritance, deception, and murder—Emer witnessed the Son of Righteousness—Many prophets called for repentance—A serious famine and venomous snakes troubled the people.
Now, I, Moroni, continue with my account. So it happened that due to the secret plots of Akish and his allies, they overthrew the kingdom of Omer.
However, the Lord was kind to Omer and his sons and daughters who did not seek to harm him.
The Lord warned Omer in a dream to leave the land; therefore, Omer left with his family and traveled for many days, passing by the hill of Shim and the place where the Nephites were destroyed, then heading eastward until he reached a location by the sea called Ablom, where he set up his tent with his sons, daughters, and all his household, except for Jared and his family.
Eventually, Jared was made king over the people through treachery; he gave his daughter as a wife to Akish.
Then, Akish plotted to kill his father-in-law. He reached out to those he had sworn an oath to, and they killed his father-in-law while he was sitting on his throne, listening to his people.
This wicked secret society had spread so much that it corrupted everyone's hearts; thus, Jared was murdered on his throne, and Akish took his place.
Then, Akish grew jealous of his son and imprisoned him, providing him hardly any food until he died.
Now, the brother of the one who died, named Nimrah, was angry with his father for what he had done.
Nimrah gathered a small group of men and escaped from the land to join Omer.
Meanwhile, Akish had other sons who won the people's hearts, even though they had sworn to follow Akish’s corrupt desires.
The people of Akish wanted wealth, just as Akish wanted power; so, the sons of Akish offered money to persuade most of the people to follow them.
This led to a war between the sons of Akish and Akish himself, which continued for many years and resulted in the near destruction of everyone in the kingdom, with only thirty souls remaining, along with those who fled with the house of Omer.
As a result, Omer returned to his land of inheritance.
Omer grew old, but in his old age, he fathered Emer and appointed him to be king.
After Emer was anointed king, Omer saw two years of peace in the land before dying, having lived a long life filled with sorrow. Emer then took over, following in his father’s footsteps.
The Lord began to lift the curse from the land, and the family of Emer thrived under his reign; in sixty-two years, they grew very strong and wealthy—
They had all kinds of fruit, grain, silk, fine linen, gold, silver, and precious items;
And they also had many cattle, including oxen, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, and other animals useful for food.
Additionally, they had horses and donkeys, along with elephants and other useful creatures, particularly the elephants.
Thus, the Lord poured out his blessings upon this special land, commanding that anyone who owned it should dedicate it to Him, or they would be destroyed when their sins reached their peak, saying that He would unleash His full wrath on them.
Emer judged righteously throughout his reign, having many sons and daughters, and he appointed Coriantum to rule in his place.
After appointing Coriantum, Emer lived for four more years, witnessing peace in the land; he even saw the Son of Righteousness and rejoiced in his day before dying peacefully.
Coriantum followed his father's example, building mighty cities and bringing good leadership to his people throughout his life. Yet he had no children until he was very old.
Eventually, his wife passed away at the age of one hundred and two. In his old age, Coriantum married a young woman and had sons and daughters; he lived to be one hundred and forty-two years old.
Coriantum had a son named Com, who succeeded him and reigned for forty-nine years, fathering Heth and other sons and daughters.
The people began to spread across the land again, and wickedness increased, causing Heth to resurrect the secret plots of old to kill his father.
Heth eventually overthrew his father, killing him with his sword and taking the throne.
Once more, prophets appeared in the land, calling for repentance and warning that they must prepare for the Lord's coming or suffer a curse, including a devastating famine that would lead to their destruction.
But the people dismissed the prophets’ words, casting them out, and some were thrown into pits to die. This happened by the order of King Heth.
As a result, a severe drought afflicted the land, and the inhabitants faced fast destruction due to the lack of rain.
Venomous snakes also appeared, poisoning many people, and their livestock fled south toward a Nephite area called Zarahemla.
Many perished along the way; however, some managed to flee into the southern land.
The Lord caused the snakes to stop pursuing the people, blocking their way, so that anyone attempting to pass might fall victim to the poisonous snakes.
The people followed the animals and ate the carcasses of those that died along the way, until they had consumed them all. Realizing they were facing death, they began to repent of their sins and cried out to the Lord.
Once they humbled themselves enough, the Lord sent rain upon the earth, and the people started to recover; there was a return of fruit in the northern regions and across the surrounding lands. The Lord demonstrated His power by saving them from famine.
