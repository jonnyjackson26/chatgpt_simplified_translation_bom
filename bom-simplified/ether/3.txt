The brother of Jared sees the finger of the Lord as He touches sixteen stones—Christ shows His spirit body to the brother of Jared—Those who have a perfect knowledge cannot be kept from within the veil—Interpreters are provided to bring the Jaredite record to light.
The brother of Jared (who had prepared eight vessels) went up to a very tall mountain called Shelem, where he shaped sixteen small stones out of rock. They were clear and white like glass, and he carried them in his hands to the top of the mountain, where he cried out to the Lord, saying:
O Lord, you told us that we would be surrounded by floods. Please don’t be angry with me for my weaknesses; I know that you are holy and live in heaven, and that we are undeserving of your attention because our nature is continuously inclined toward evil due to the fall. Still, O Lord, you commanded us to call on you so we can receive what we desire from you.
Look, O Lord, you have struck us for our sins and forced us into the wilderness for many years; yet you have been merciful to us. O Lord, have compassion on me, and do not let your anger be directed at your people. Don’t allow them to cross this raging sea in darkness; instead, look at the stones I made from the rock.
I know, O Lord, that you have all power and can do whatever you choose for our greater good. So, please touch these stones with your finger and prepare them to shine in the darkness. They will provide light in the vessels we made, so we can have light while we cross the sea.
Look, O Lord, you can do this. We know that you can demonstrate great power, which might seem small to human understanding.
And after the brother of Jared said this, the Lord reached out his hand and touched each stone with his finger. The veil was lifted from the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the Lord’s finger; it looked like a human finger, made of flesh and blood, and the brother of Jared fell down in fear.
The Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the ground and asked him: Get up, why are you on the ground?
He replied: I saw the finger of the Lord and was afraid he might strike me, not knowing that the Lord had flesh and blood.
The Lord said: Because of your faith, you have seen that I will take upon myself flesh and blood. No one has ever come before me with such great faith as yours; if that weren’t the case, you wouldn’t have seen my finger. Did you see anything more than this?
He answered: No; Lord, please show yourself to me.
The Lord asked him: Do you believe what I am about to say?
He replied: Yes, Lord, I know that you speak the truth because you are a God of truth and cannot lie.
After he said this, the Lord revealed himself to him and said: Because you know these things, you are saved from the fall; you can now be close to me, so I reveal myself to you.
Look, I am the one who was prepared from the beginning to redeem my people. I am Jesus Christ. I am both the Father and the Son. Through me, all people can have eternal life if they believe in my name; they will become my sons and daughters.
I have never shown myself to anyone I created because no one has ever believed in me like you have. Do you see that you were made in my image? Yes, every person was created in the beginning in my image.
Look, this body you see before you is my spirit’s body; I created mankind after the likeness of my spirit. Just as I appear to you in spirit, I will appear in the flesh to my people.
Now, as I, Moroni, mentioned, I cannot give a full account of these things that are written, so I will simply say that Jesus appeared to this man in spirit and showed himself in the same way he did to the Nephites.
He ministered to him just like he ministered to the Nephites, so this man would know that he was God due to the many great works the Lord had shown him.
And because of what this man knew, he could not be prevented from seeing beyond the veil; he saw the finger of Jesus, which caused him to fall in fear because he realized it was the Lord’s finger. His faith became unwavering, as he no longer doubted.
With this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept from the veil, thus he saw Jesus, who ministered to him.
The Lord then said to the brother of Jared: You must not let what you have seen and heard be shared with the world until the time I glorify my name in the flesh; therefore, treasure what you have seen and heard and don’t show it to anyone.
And when you come to me, you will write these things down and seal them so that no one can interpret them; you will write them in a language that cannot be read.
Look, I will give you these two stones, and you will seal them with the writings you create.
You see, I have confused the language you will write in; therefore, in my own time, these stones will allow people to see what you have written.
After the Lord said these things, he showed the brother of Jared all the people who had ever lived on the earth and all who would live; he revealed everything to him, even to the ends of the earth.
He had previously told him that if he believed, he could show him all things, so the Lord could not withhold any knowledge from him because he understood that the Lord could reveal anything.
The Lord instructed him: Write these things down and seal them; I will reveal them to humanity in my own time.
It happened that the Lord commanded him to seal the two stones he had received and not to show them until the Lord intended to reveal them to mankind.
