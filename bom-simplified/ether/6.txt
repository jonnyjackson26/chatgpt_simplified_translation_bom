Now I, Moroni, will continue to tell the story of Jared and his brother. 
After the Lord prepared the stones that the brother of Jared had carried up the mountain, he brought them back down and placed the stones in the boats, one at each end. Suddenly, the stones began to shine and provided light for the boats.
This is how the Lord made the stones shine in the darkness, so that everyone—men, women, and children—could see as they crossed the great waters.
Once they had prepared all kinds of food to sustain themselves and their animals for the journey on the water, they boarded their boats, putting their trust in the Lord, and set off into the sea.
Then the Lord caused a powerful wind to blow across the waters toward the promised land, and they were tossed around on the waves.
They were often submerged in the depths of the sea due to the massive waves and terrible storms brought on by the fierce wind.
Even when they were submerged, the water couldn’t harm them because their boats were sealed tight like a dish and like Noah’s ark. So, when surrounded by deep waters, they cried out to the Lord, and He brought them back to the surface.
Throughout their journey, the wind kept blowing toward the promised land, pushing them along the water.
They sang praises to the Lord; the brother of Jared sang and thanked the Lord all day long, and didn’t stop praising Him even when night fell.
Thus, they were carried along, and no sea creatures could harm them. They had constant light, whether above or below the water.
They were driven forth for three hundred forty-four days on the water.
Finally, they landed on the shore of the promised land. When they stepped onto the land, they knelt down and humbled themselves before the Lord, shedding tears of joy for His abundant mercy.
Then they moved across the land and began to cultivate the earth.
Jared had four sons named Jacom, Gilgah, Mahah, and Orihah.
The brother of Jared also had sons and daughters.
The friends of Jared and his brother totaled about twenty-two people; they too had children before reaching the promised land, so their numbers grew.
They were taught to live humbly before the Lord and received teachings from on high.
Eventually, they began to spread across the land, multiply, and farm; they grew stronger in the land.
As the brother of Jared grew older, he realized he would soon die, so he told Jared, “Let’s gather our people to count them and understand what they want from us before we pass away.”
The people were gathered. The brother of Jared had twenty-two children, while Jared had twelve, including his four sons.
They counted their people and asked them what they wanted their leaders to do before dying.
The people requested that they appoint one of their sons to be their king.
This request troubled them. The brother of Jared warned them, “This will lead to bondage.”
But Jared said to his brother: “Let them have a king. So tell them to choose one of our sons to be king, whoever they want.”
Eventually, they selected the firstborn son of the brother of Jared, whose name was Pagag. However, he refused to be their king. The people wanted his father to force him, but his father would not do so and commanded them not to force anyone to be king.
Then they chose Pagag’s brothers, but they refused as well.
In the end, the sons of Jared also declined, except for one; Orihah was anointed to be the king.
He began to reign, and the people prospered and became very wealthy.
Eventually, Jared and his brother both died.
Orihah continued to walk humbly before the Lord, remembering the great things the Lord had done for his father, and taught his people about the wonderful deeds of the Lord in their family history.
