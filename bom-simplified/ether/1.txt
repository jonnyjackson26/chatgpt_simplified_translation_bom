The Book of Ether
The record of the Jaredites, taken from the twenty-four plates found by the people of Limhi during King Mosiah's reign.
Moroni summarizes the writings of Ether—Ether's family lineage is outlined—The language of the Jaredites was not confused at the Tower of Babel—The Lord promises to guide them to a special land and make them a great nation.
Now, I, Moroni, will tell you about those ancient people who were destroyed by the hand of the Lord in this northern region.
I base my account on the twenty-four plates that were discovered by Limhi's people, known as the Book of Ether.
I believe that the first part of this record, which discusses the creation of the world, Adam’s story, and the events leading up to the great tower, is already recorded among the Jews.
So, I won’t write about things that happened from Adam's time up to that point; these details are on the plates, and whoever finds them will have the ability to access the complete story.
But pay attention, I am not providing the full story; rather, I will share a portion of it, starting from the tower down to their destruction.
Here’s how I present the account: The author of this record was Ether, who was a descendant of Coriantor.
Coriantor was the son of Moron.
Moron was the son of Ethem.
Ethem was the son of Ahah.
Ahah was the son of Seth.
Seth was the son of Shiblon.
Shiblon was the son of Com.
Com was the son of Coriantum.
Coriantum was the son of Amnigaddah.
Amnigaddah was the son of Aaron.
Aaron was a descendant of Heth, who was the son of Hearthom.
Hearthom was the son of Lib.
Lib was the son of Kish.
Kish was the son of Corom.
Corom was the son of Levi.
Levi was the son of Kim.
Kim was the son of Morianton.
Morianton was a descendant of Riplakish.
Riplakish was the son of Shez.
Shez was the son of Heth.
Heth was the son of Com.
Com was the son of Coriantum.
Coriantum was the son of Emer.
Emer was the son of Omer.
Omer was the son of Shule.
Shule was the son of Kib.
Kib was the son of Orihah, who was the son of Jared;
Jared came with his brother, their families, and some others from the great tower when the Lord confused the language of the people and, in His anger, declared they would be scattered across the earth, which happened as He said.
Jared, having a large and mighty brother who was favored by the Lord, urged him to pray to the Lord so that their language would not be confused, allowing them to understand each other.
The brother of Jared cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed kindness to Jared, so their language remained intact, and they could still understand one another.
Then Jared told his brother: Pray again to the Lord so He may spare our friends from being confused and losing their language.
The brother of Jared prayed again, and the Lord showed compassion for their friends and families, ensuring they were not confused either.
After that, Jared told his brother: Go ask the Lord if He will drive us out of this land and if He does, pray to know where we should go. Who knows if the Lord will lead us to a land that is better than anywhere else? If so, let us remain faithful so we can receive it as our inheritance.
The brother of Jared prayed to the Lord just as Jared had suggested.
The Lord heard the brother of Jared's prayer, showed compassion, and said to him:
Gather all your flocks, both male and female, of every kind; also gather the seeds of the earth and your families, along with Jared and his family, and their friends and families.
Once you have done this, lead them down into the northern valley. There I will meet you, and I will guide you to a land that is better than all other lands.
There, I will bless you and your descendants, raising up from them and your brother's descendants a great nation, one greater than any other nation from your lineage on the earth. I will do this for you because you've been crying out to me for a long time.
