Orihah ruled the land with fairness, making just decisions throughout his long life. 
He had many children, a total of thirty-one, including twenty-three sons. 
In his old age, he had a son named Kib, who took over as king after him, and Kib fathered Corihor. 
When Corihor turned thirty-two, he rebelled against his father and moved to the land of Nehor, where he had many beautiful children, attracting a large following. 
Gathering an army, Corihor attacked the land of Moron, where the king lived, and captured him, fulfilling a prophecy spoken by the brother of Jared about future captivity. 
The land of Moron, where the king stayed, was close to the Nephite territory called Desolation. 
Kib remained a captive under his son Corihor until he was very old; even then, he had a son named Shule while still imprisoned. 
Shule became angry with his brother, grew strong, and showed great skill in making decisions. 
So, he went to hill Ephraim, mined some metal, and crafted swords for his followers; after equipping them, he returned to Nehor city and fought his brother Corihor, reclaiming the kingdom for their father Kib. 
Due to Shule's actions, his father granted him the kingdom, and he began to rule in Kib's place. 
Shule judged fairly and expanded his kingdom because the population had greatly increased. 
Shule also had many sons and daughters. 
Corihor felt remorse for his wrongdoings, so Shule allowed him to participate in the kingdom's affairs. 
Corihor had many children, one of whom was named Noah. 
Noah rebelled against King Shule and his father Corihor, convincing his brother Cohor and many others to join him. 
He fought against King Shule and took control of the land they had first inherited, becoming king of that region. 
Noah challenged Shule again, captured him, and planned to kill him, but Shule's sons snuck into Noah's home at night, killed Noah, and freed their father, restoring him to his throne. 
Afterward, Noah's son tried to claim the throne for himself, but he couldn't regain power over King Shule, whose people thrived and grew strong. 
The territory became divided into two kingdoms: the kingdom of Shule and the kingdom of Cohor, Noah's son. 
Cohor led his people to fight against Shule, but Shule defeated them and killed Cohor. 
Cohor's son, Nimrod, surrendered the kingdom back to Shule and gained Shule's favor, enjoying privileges within Shule's reign. 
During Shule's rule, prophets were sent by the Lord to warn the people that their wickedness and idol worship were bringing disaster upon the land, and they would face destruction unless they turned away from their sins. 
The people insulted and mocked the prophets, so King Shule punished those who disrespected them. 
He established a law throughout the land that gave the prophets the freedom to go wherever they wanted, which helped lead the people to repent. 
When the people turned away from their wrongdoings and idolatries, the Lord showed mercy, and they began to flourish again. In his later years, Shule had more children. 
There were no more wars during Shule's reign, and he remembered the great deeds done by the Lord for his ancestors, who had brought them across the ocean to the promised land; thus, he ruled fairly for the rest of his life.
