During the time of Com, many prophets came and warned that this great nation would be destroyed unless they turned back to the Lord and stopped their murders and evil deeds.
The people did not listen to the prophets and tried to harm them, so the prophets sought refuge with Com.
They told Com many important things, and he was blessed for the rest of his life.
He lived a long life and had a son named Shiblom, who became king after him. However, Shiblom's brother rebelled, leading to a very large war throughout the land.
Shiblom's brother ordered the execution of all prophets who warned about the destruction of their people.
There was great suffering across the land because the prophets declared that a terrible curse would fall upon them, resulting in the kind of destruction that had never been seen before, turning their bones into piles of dirt unless they repented from their sins.
They did not listen to the Lord due to their wickedness, so wars and strife broke out throughout the land, along with many famines and diseases, bringing about unprecedented destruction; this all occurred during Shiblom's reign.
The people began to feel remorse for their wrongdoings, and as they did, the Lord showed them mercy.
Eventually, Shiblom was killed, and Seth was taken captive, remaining in captivity for the rest of his life.
Seth's son, Ahah, took over the kingdom, ruling over the people for his entire life, during which he committed many wrongdoings that led to much bloodshed, and his reign was short.
Ethem, a descendant of Ahah, came into power and also committed wrongdoings during his rule.
During Ethemâ€™s reign, many prophets appeared again, warning the people that the Lord would completely destroy them from the earth unless they repented for their sins.
However, the people hardened their hearts, ignoring the prophets' messages, which caused the prophets to grieve and distance themselves from the people.
Ethem ruled unjustly throughout his life and fathered Moron. Moron then became king but continued to act wickedly in the eyes of the Lord.
A rebellion broke out among the people due to a secretive group seeking power and wealth; a powerful man emerged and challenged Moron, defeating him and taking control of half the kingdom for many years.
Eventually, Moron managed to overthrow him and regain the kingdom.
Then arose another powerful man who was related to the brother of Jared.
He defeated Moron and took the kingdom for himself; as a result, Moron lived in captivity for the rest of his life and became the father of Coriantor.
Coriantor also spent his entire life in captivity.
During Coriantor's time, several prophets came forward with significant messages, calling the people to repent or face God's judgment that would lead to their total destruction.
They warned that God would bring a new people to inherit the land through His power, just as He did for their ancestors.
Despite these warnings, the people dismissed the prophets because of their secret society and evil practices.
Coriantor fathered Ether and died, having lived his entire life in captivity.
