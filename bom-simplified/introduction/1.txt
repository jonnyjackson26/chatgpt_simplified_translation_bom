The Book of Mormon is a sacred book like the Bible. It is a record of how God interacted with ancient people in the Americas and includes the complete message of the everlasting gospel.
Many ancient prophets wrote this book through inspiration and revelation. Their words, which were engraved on gold plates, were summarized and organized by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record recounts the histories of two major civilizations. One group left Jerusalem around 600 B.C. and later split into two nations called the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other group, known as the Jaredites, arrived much earlier when God confused languages at the Tower of Babel. After thousands of years, all were wiped out except for the Lamanites, who are considered to be among the ancestors of the American Indians.
The key event documented in the Book of Mormon is when the Lord Jesus Christ visited the Nephites shortly after His resurrection. It teaches the principles of the gospel, explains the plan of salvation, and describes what people need to do to find peace in this life and eternal life afterward.
Once Mormon finished his writings, he passed them to his son Moroni, who added some of his own thoughts and hid the plates in the Hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, Moroni, now a glorious resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and gave him guidance regarding the ancient record and how it should be translated into English.
Eventually, the plates were given to Joseph Smith, and he translated them through God’s power and inspiration. The record is now available in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that anyone who comes to Him and follows His teachings can be saved.
Regarding this record, Joseph Smith stated: “I told the brothers that the Book of Mormon is the most accurate book on earth, the foundation of our faith, and that a person can get closer to God by following its teachings than by following any other book.”
Along with Joseph Smith, the Lord allowed eleven others to see the gold plates firsthand, serving as special witnesses to the truthfulness and divine nature of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included here as “The Testimony of Three Witnesses” and “The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.”
We invite everyone everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, think about its message, and then ask God, our Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, whether the book is true. Those who take this path and ask with faith will receive a personal confirmation of its truth and divinity through the Holy Spirit. (See Moroni 10:3–5.)
Those who receive this divine confirmation from the Holy Spirit will also recognize that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is His prophet and messenger in our time, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom restored on earth, preparing for the Second Coming of the Messiah.
