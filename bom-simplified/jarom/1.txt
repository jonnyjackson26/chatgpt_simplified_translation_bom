Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words because my father Enos commanded me to keep track of our family history.
Since these records are small and meant to benefit our brothers the Lamanites, I will only write a little, and I won’t include my prophecies or revelations. What more could I say than what my fathers have already said? They have already shared the plan of salvation, and that is enough for me.
Look, it is important that a lot be done among this people because their hearts are hard, their ears are deaf, their minds are blinded, and they are stubborn; yet, God is very merciful to them and hasn’t completely destroyed them from the land.
There are many among us who receive revelations, as not all of them are stubborn. Those who are not stiff-necked and have faith share a connection with the Holy Spirit, who reveals things to people based on their faith.
Now, after two hundred years had passed, the Nephites had become strong in the land. They made sure to keep the law of Moses and honor the Sabbath day. They did not disrespect God or speak against Him, and the laws of the land were very strict.
The people were spread across much of the land, and the Lamanites were even more numerous than the Nephites; they had a love for violence and enjoyed drinking the blood of animals.
Many times the Lamanites came to fight us, the Nephites. But our kings and leaders were strong in their faith in the Lord; they taught the people about the ways of the Lord. Because of this, we were able to resist the Lamanites and push them out of our lands, and we started to fortify our cities and any place that belonged to us.
We multiplied greatly and spread out over the land, becoming very wealthy in gold, silver, precious items, fine woodwork, buildings, equipment, as well as iron, copper, brass, and steel, making all kinds of tools for farming and weapons for war, including sharp arrows, quivers, darts, javelins, and everything needed for battle.
Being well-prepared, the Lamanites were unsuccessful against us. The Lord's word to our ancestors was proven true: if we keep His commandments, we will prosper in the land.
The prophets of the Lord warned the Nephites that if they didn’t keep the commandments and turned to sin, they would be destroyed from the land.
Thus, the prophets, priests, and teachers worked hard, patiently urging the people to be diligent; they taught the law of Moses and its purpose and encouraged them to look forward to the coming Messiah and have faith in Him as if He were already here. This is how they taught them.
By doing this, they helped prevent the people's destruction, as they inspired their hearts with the word and continually motivated them to repent.
After two hundred thirty-eight years had passed, filled with wars, disputes, and conflicts for much of that time.
I, Jarom, will not write more because the plates are small. But you, my brothers, can refer to the other Nephite records; there, the details of our wars are engraved, based on what the kings wrote or ordered to be written.
I pass these plates to my son Omni, so they can be preserved according to my fathers’ commands.
