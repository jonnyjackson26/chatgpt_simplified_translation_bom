Let it be known to everyone, no matter where they are from or what language they speak, that Joseph Smith Jr., who translated this work, has shown us the plates that people talk about. They look like they are made of gold. We touched as many of the leaves as he has translated, and we also saw the engravings on them, which appear to be of ancient origin and have intricate designs. We testify with sincere words that Joseph Smith has indeed shown us these plates; we have seen them and held them, and we are certain that he possesses the plates we mentioned. We declare our names to the world to testify about what we have witnessed. We are telling the truth, with God as our witness.
