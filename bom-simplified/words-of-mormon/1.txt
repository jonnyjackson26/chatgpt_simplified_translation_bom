The Words of Mormon
I, Mormon, am about to hand over the record I've been working on to my son Moroni, and I've seen nearly all that has led to the destruction of my people, the Nephites.
It has been many hundreds of years since Christ came when I give these records to my son; I believe he will see the complete destruction of our people. But I pray that he might live on to write something about them and about Christ so that maybe one day it can be of use to them.
Now, I want to share some thoughts on what I've written; after I condensed the records from the plates of Nephi down to the time of King Benjamin, mentioned by Amaleki, I looked through the records I had, and I came across these plates, which include a brief account of the prophets from Jacob to the reign of King Benjamin, plus many teachings from Nephi.
I found the messages on these plates to be encouraging, especially the prophecies about Christ's coming, which my ancestors believed were mostly fulfilled; I know that all prophecies concerning us up to now have come true, and those that are still to come will surely happen.
So, I decided to use these things to complete my record, drawing from the plates of Nephi, as I cannot capture even a tiny fraction of my people's stories.
However, I will take these plates with prophecies and revelations and include them with the rest of my record because they are special to me; I trust they will be valued by my fellow believers.
I do this for a good reason; this is what feels right to me through the inspiration of the Lord’s Spirit within me. I don’t know everything, but the Lord knows all that is to come, so I act according to His will.
I pray that my people can once again recognize God, specifically the salvation offered by Christ, and that they can become a joyful people once more.
Now, I, Mormon, will finish my record, which I take from the plates of Nephi, and I will do it based on the knowledge and understanding God has given me.
After Amaleki handed over these plates to King Benjamin, he added them to the other records passed down from kings through the generations until the time of King Benjamin.
These records were then handed down through generations until they reached me. I, Mormon, pray to God that they will be preserved from now on. I believe they will be preserved because they contain important revelations that will be used to judge my people and others at the final judgment, according to God's word.
Now, about King Benjamin—there were some conflicts among his people.
The armies of the Lamanites also came down from the land of Nephi to fight against his people. But King Benjamin rallied his armies and faced them, fighting valiantly with Laban’s sword.
With the Lord’s strength, they fought bravely against their enemies, claiming the lives of many thousands of Lamanites. They continued to battle until they had pushed the Lamanites out of all their rightful lands.
After the rise of false Christs, who were silenced and punished for their actions;
And after false prophets and teachers arose among the people, all punished for their deceit; following a time of great fighting and disagreements that led many to the Lamanites, King Benjamin, aided by the holy prophets among his people—
King Benjamin was a righteous leader, and he ruled his people justly; many righteous men spoke the word of God with power and authority, often speaking bluntly due to the stubbornness of the people—
So, with their help, King Benjamin worked tirelessly with all his energy and soul, alongside the prophets, to restore peace in the land.
