I, Mormon, am writing down everything I have seen and heard, and I call this book the Book of Mormon.
When Ammaron hid the records for the Lord, he came to me when I was about ten years old and starting to learn. Ammaron said to me, “I see that you are a serious child and quick to notice things.”
So, when you turn about twenty-four years old, I want you to remember what you have seen about this people. When you reach that age, go to the land Antum, to a hill called Shim. There, I have hidden all the sacred records concerning this people.
You will take the plates of Nephi for yourself, but leave the rest where they are. You should write on the plates of Nephi everything you have observed about this people.
I, Mormon, am a descendant of Nephi (my father's name was also Mormon), and I remembered what Ammaron told me.
When I was eleven years old, my father took me to the land southward, to the land of Zarahemla.
The entire area was filled with buildings, and the people were nearly as numerous as the grains of sand on the shore.
During that year, a war started between the Nephites (composed of Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, and Zoramites) and the Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.
The Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites were all called Lamanites, and the two opposing groups were the Nephites and the Lamanites.
The fighting began near Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.
The Nephites gathered a large army of over thirty thousand men. During that same year, they fought several battles and defeated the Lamanites, killing many of them.
Eventually, the Lamanites decided to pull back from their plans, and peace returned to the land for about four years, during which time there was no bloodshed.
However, wickedness took over the land, and because of the people's wrongdoings, the Lord took away His beloved disciples, and miracles and healings stopped.
There were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not touch anyone due to their wickedness and lack of faith.
At the age of fifteen, I was somewhat serious-minded, so the Lord visited me, and I experienced and understood the goodness of Jesus.
I tried to preach to the people, but I was stopped and forbidden to speak because they had deliberately rebelled against their God, and the beloved disciples were taken away because of their sins.
I stayed among them but was not allowed to preach because of their hardened hearts. Because of their stubbornness, the land was cursed.
The Gadianton robbers who were with the Lamanites infested the land, causing the people to start hiding their treasures underground. The land became treacherous because the Lord cursed it, so they could not keep their treasures.
It also became a time of sorceries, witchcraft, and magic; the power of evil spread across the land, fulfilling the prophecies of Abinadi and Samuel the Lamanite.
