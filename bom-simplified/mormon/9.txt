Now, I want to talk about those who do not believe in Christ.
Will you believe when the Lord comes, on that great day when the earth will be changed completely and the elements will burn away? On that day, when you stand before the Lamb of God—will you then say that there is no God?
Will you keep denying Christ, or can you bear to see the Lamb of God? Do you think you can be with Him while fully aware of your sins? Do you think it would make you happy to be with Him—this holy being—when your conscience is troubled by the guilt of having broken His laws?
I tell you, you would be more miserable being with a holy and just God while feeling unclean before him than you would be with those who are condemned in hell.
When you are shown your sins before God, and also His glory and the purity of Jesus Christ, it will ignite an unbearable fire within you.
So, unbelievers, turn to the Lord; plead urgently with the Father in Jesus's name, that you might be found pure, clean, and holy, having been washed by the blood of the Lamb on that final day.
Again, I address those of you who reject God's revelations and say that they are no longer relevant; that there are no revelations, prophecies, gifts, or healings, or instances of speaking in tongues and interpreting those languages;
I say to you, anyone who denies these things does not know the gospel of Christ; they probably haven’t read the scriptures; if they have, they do not understand them.
Do we not read that God remains the same throughout time, and in Him, there is no change or variation?
If you have imagined a God who changes, then you have created a false image of God, one who does not perform miracles.
But look, let me show you a God of miracles— the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the very God who created the heavens and the earth, along with everything in them.
See, He created Adam, and through Adam, sin entered the world. Through this, Jesus Christ came, both the Father and the Son; and because of Him, there is redemption for mankind.
And through the redemption brought by Jesus Christ, people can return to God's presence; this is how all will be freed, because Christ's death leads to resurrection, which allows all to wake from an endless sleep; when the trumpet sounds, everyone will rise—both small and great—and stand before Him, redeemed and loosed from the chains of death, which is only a temporary separation.
Then comes the judgment from the Holy One; at that time, those who are impure will remain impure, and the righteous will still be righteous; the joyful will stay happy, and the sad will remain sad.
Now, you who have imagined a god who cannot perform miracles, let me ask you—have the events I've described already occurred? Has the end come? I say to you, no; God continues to be a God of miracles.
Aren't the things performed by God astonishing to us? Indeed, who can fathom the amazing works of God?
Who will claim it was not a miracle that He created the heavens and the earth with His words; that He formed man from the dust through His words; and by His words, miracles have been done?
And who will deny that Jesus Christ performed many great miracles? The apostles also accomplished many remarkable miracles through their actions.
And if miracles occurred then, why would God stop being a God of miracles while also remaining unchanging? I tell you, He does not change; if He did, He would cease to be God; He is continually God and a God of miracles.
The reason miracles are less frequent among people is that they fall into unbelief, stray from the right path, and fail to know the God they should trust.
I tell you that whoever believes in Christ, without doubt, will have what they ask from the Father in the name of Christ granted to them, and this promise is given to everyone, even to the ends of the world.
For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, told His disciples who were to remain behind—yes, and all His followers listening to the crowd: Go out into all the world and share the gospel with every living creature;
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned;
These signs will follow those who believe—in My name, they will drive out demons; they will speak in new languages; they will handle snakes; and if they drink poison, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover;
And anyone who believes in My name, without doubting, I will affirm all My words to them, even to the ends of the earth.
Now, who can stand against the works of the Lord? Who can deny His words? Who will oppose the mighty power of the Lord? Who will disregard the work of the Lord? Who will look down on the children of Christ? All who scorn the works of the Lord, take heed—you will be filled with wonder and perish.
So do not scoff, and do not be in awe, but listen to the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in Jesus's name for whatever you need. Don't doubt, but believe, and return to the Lord wholeheartedly, and work out your salvation with fear and trembling before Him.
Be wise during the time you have; rid yourselves of all impurity; ask not for your own desires, but ask with unwavering faith, that you will not yield to any temptation, but will serve the true and living God.
Make sure you are not baptized unworthily; ensure you partake of the sacrament of Christ in worthiness; and do everything with worthiness, doing it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; if you do this and endure to the end, you will never be cast out.
I speak to you as if I were speaking from beyond the grave because I know you will hear my words.
Do not judge me for my faults, nor my father for his faults, nor those who wrote before him; instead, thank God for revealing our imperfections to you, so that you can learn to be wiser than we have been.
Now, we have written this record based on what we know, using the characters we call reformed Egyptian, which we have adapted and changed to fit how we speak.
If our plates were big enough, we would have written in Hebrew; but we have also changed the Hebrew; had we been able to write in Hebrew, you would not have found imperfections in our record.
Yet, the Lord knows what we have written, and none other people knows our language; and since no other people understands our language, He has prepared ways for translating it.
These writings are made so we may cleanse ourselves of the blood of our brothers who have strayed into unbelief.
Look, we desire for our brothers, even their return to the knowledge of Christ, to be fulfilled according to the prayers of all the saints who have lived in this land.
May the Lord Jesus Christ fulfill their prayers according to their faith; may God the Father remember the covenant He made with the house of Israel; and may He bless them forever, through faith in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
