In the year 363, the Nephites went to battle against the Lamanites from the land known as Desolation. 
The Nephite troops were pushed back to Desolation, and while they were still tired, a new Lamanite army attacked them fiercely. The Lamanites captured the city of Desolation, killed many Nephites, and took several prisoners.
The remaining Nephites fled and found refuge with the people in the city of Teancum, which was located along the shore near Desolation.
The Nephites were suffering defeats because they took the initiative to attack the Lamanites; otherwise, the Lamanites wouldn't have been able to overpower them.
However, it is clear that God’s judgment will come upon the wicked, and it’s the wicked who incite violence in the hearts of others.
The Lamanites started preparing to attack the city of Teancum. 
In the year 364, the Lamanites attacked Teancum with the intent to capture it as well.
However, the Nephites managed to repel the Lamanites and drive them back. Seeing their success, the Nephites boasted about their strength and regained control of the city of Desolation.
After all these events, there had been thousands killed on both sides—the Nephites and the Lamanites.
By the year 366, the Lamanites returned to battle against the Nephites once again, but the Nephites did not repent for their wrongdoing and continued in their evil ways.
Words cannot adequately capture the horrific scenes of bloodshed among the Nephite and Lamanite people; their hearts became hard and they took pleasure in violence.
There had never been such widespread evil among the descendants of Lehi, nor among all the people of Israel, as the Lord had said about these people.
The Lamanites took control of the city of Desolation because their numbers greatly outnumbered the Nephites.
They also marched against the city of Teancum, driving out its residents, capturing many women and children, and sacrificing them to their idol gods.
In the year 367, the Nephites, furious over the sacrifices of their women and children, attacked the Lamanites with great rage, defeating them and driving them from their lands.
The Lamanites did not confront the Nephites again until the year 375.
In that year, they came against the Nephites with overwhelming strength; their numbers were so large they weren’t even counted.
From that point on, the Nephites could not regain control over the Lamanites and began to be defeated easily, like dew evaporating in the sun.
The Lamanites launched an attack against the city of Desolation, resulting in a fierce battle where they triumphed over the Nephites.
The Nephites fled once more and reached the city of Boaz, where they stood their ground against the Lamanites, fighting valiantly until the Lamanites returned for a second assault.
During the second attack, the Nephites suffered heavy casualties, and their women and children were again sacrificed to idols.
The Nephites fled again from the Lamanites, taking all the people from their towns and villages with them.
Seeing that the Lamanites were about to conquer the land, I, Mormon, went to the hill Shim and took all the records that Ammaron had hidden up with the Lord.
