The Lamanites did not come to fight again until ten more years had gone by. During that time, I had my people, the Nephites, get their land and weapons ready for battle.
The Lord told me to call out to these people—“Repent and come to me, be baptized, rebuild my church, and you will be saved.”
I called out to them, but it was useless; they didn’t understand that it was the Lord who had spared them and given them a chance to change. Instead, they hardened their hearts against God.
After ten years passed, which made it a total of three hundred sixty years since Christ’s coming, the king of the Lamanites sent me a letter informing me that they were getting ready to attack us again.
I gathered my people together at the land Desolation, near a city by the narrow pass that led south.
We set up our armies there, intending to stop the Lamanite forces from taking any of our land; we fortified ourselves with all our strength.
In the year three hundred sixty-one, the Lamanites attacked the city of Desolation; we defeated them so badly that they retreated to their own territories.
In the year three hundred sixty-two, they came to battle again. We defeated them once more and killed many of them, whose bodies were thrown into the sea.
Now, because of this victory, my people, the Nephites, began to boast about their strength and declared before heaven that they would take revenge for the blood of their slain brothers.
They vowed by heaven and the throne of God that they would go to battle against their enemies and remove them from the land.
At this point, I, Mormon, refused to be their commander or leader because of their wickedness and corruption.
I had led them many times into battle despite their wrongdoing, caring for them deeply with God’s love in my heart; I prayed for them constantly, but my prayers lacked faith due to their hardened hearts.
I had saved them from their enemies three times, but they never truly repented for their sins.
After swearing by everything forbidden by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ that they would fight their enemies for revenge, the Lord spoke to me, saying:
“Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; because this people did not repent after I delivered them, they will be cut off from the earth.”
I completely refused to fight my enemies and obeyed the Lord’s command; I chose to remain a silent witness to show the world what I saw and heard, as the Spirit revealed future events to me.
So, I write to you, Gentiles, and to the house of Israel, when the work begins, to prepare to return to your land of inheritance;
Yes, I write to all people everywhere; especially to you, twelve tribes of Israel, who will be judged according to your actions by the twelve disciples chosen by Jesus in Jerusalem.
I also write to the remnant of my people, who will be judged by the same twelve chosen by Jesus in this land and by another group of twelve chosen in Jerusalem.
The Spirit has revealed these things to me, and that’s why I write to all of you. I want you to understand that you will all stand before the judgment of Christ, every person from Adam's family, to be judged for your deeds, whether good or bad.
And I want you to believe in the gospel of Jesus Christ, which you will have among you; also, the Jews, who are God’s chosen people, will have another witness besides the one they saw and heard, confirming that Jesus, whom they crucified, is the true Christ and God.
I hope to persuade everyone on earth to repent and prepare to stand before Christ's judgment seat.
