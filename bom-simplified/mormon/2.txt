In that same year, a war broke out again between the Nephites and the Lamanites. Even though I was young, I was tall; so, the Nephite people chose me to be their leader and commander of their armies.
So, when I turned sixteen, I led the Nephite army against the Lamanites, and by that time, three hundred and twenty-six years had passed.
In the three hundred and twenty-seventh year, the Lamanites attacked us with overwhelming force, frightening my troops so much that they refused to fight and started retreating toward the northern territories.
We reached the city of Angola, took control of it, and prepared to defend against the Lamanites. We fortified the city with all our strength; however, despite our defenses, the Lamanites came and drove us out of the city.
They also pushed us out of the land of David.
We marched on and arrived at the land of Joshua, which was located along the western seashore.
We gathered our people as quickly as possible to assemble them into one group.
However, the land was filled with robbers and Lamanites; and despite the imminent danger facing my people, they did not turn away from their wickedness. As a result, there was widespread violence and bloodshed across the land, on both sides, creating a cycle of destruction.
Now, the Lamanites had a king named Aaron, who led an army of forty-four thousand against us. I confronted him with an army of forty-two thousand. Eventually, I was able to defeat him, forcing him to flee from me. This all occurred after three hundred and thirty years had gone by.
The Nephites began to feel remorse for their sins and cried out, just as Samuel the prophet had predicted; for people could no longer protect what was theirs because of the thieves, robbers, murderers, and practitioners of dark arts present in the land.
This caused deep mourning and grief throughout the land, especially among the Nephites.
When I, Mormon, witnessed their grieving and sorrow towards the Lord, my heart started to rejoice, thinking the Lord's mercy might lead them to become righteous once more.
However, my joy was misguided, as their sorrow wasn’t a true repentance brought on by God’s goodness, but rather the kind of despair that comes from being lost, as the Lord would not allow them to find happiness in their sins.
They did not turn to Jesus with humble hearts but instead cursed God and wished for death while still fighting for their lives.
My sorrow returned as I realized it was too late for them, both in this life and the next; I saw thousands killed in outright rebellion against God, their bodies littering the land like refuse. By now, three hundred and forty-four years had passed.
In the three hundred and forty-fifth year, the Nephites began to flee from the Lamanites, who chased them all the way to the land of Jashon, where they couldn’t be stopped.
The city of Jashon was close to where Ammaron had hidden the records to protect them from destruction. Following Ammaron’s instructions, I retrieved the plates of Nephi and began chronicling the events according to his words.
On the plates of Nephi, I documented the complete history of all the wickedness and sinful acts; still, I refrained from detailing everything, as I had witnessed a constant existence of evil since I was capable of understanding human actions.
Woe is me for their wickedness; my heart has been burdened with sorrow because of their actions all my life; yet, I have faith that I will be uplifted in the end.
In that year, the Nephite people were again hunted and forced to flee. We made our way north until we reached a land called Shem.
We fortified the city of Shem and gathered our people as best as we could, hoping to save them from destruction.
In the three hundred and forty-sixth year, the Lamanites began to attack us once more.
I spoke to my people with great passion, encouraging them to bravely stand up against the Lamanites and fight for their families and homes.
My words motivated them to some extent, leading them to stand their ground instead of running away from the Lamanites.
We faced an army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand. We stood firm against them, causing them to flee from us.
When they retreated, we pursued them and encountered them again, defeating them; however, we lacked the strength of the Lord with us; we were left to our own devices, and without the Spirit of the Lord, we became weak like our brethren.
I mourned for the great disaster that befell my people due to their sins and abominations. Nevertheless, we fought against the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton until we regained control of our ancestral lands.
Three hundred and forty-nine years had passed. In the three hundred and fiftieth year, we negotiated a treaty with the Lamanites and the Gadianton robbers, leading to the division of our lands.
The Lamanites granted us the northern land, extending all the way to the narrow passage into the southern land. In return, we gave them all the land to the south.
