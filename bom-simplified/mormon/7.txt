Now, I would like to share some words with the remaining members of this people who have been spared, hoping that God will allow me to share my message, so they can learn about their ancestors; I speak to you, the remnants of Israel; and these are my words:
Understand that you are part of the house of Israel.
Realize that you need to repent, or you won't be saved.
Recognize that you must give up your weapons and stop enjoying violence, and only take them up again if God Himself commands you.
Acknowledge that you need to learn about your ancestors, repent for all your wrongdoings, and have faith in Jesus Christ—as the Son of God, who was killed by the Jews and rose again through the power of the Father, conquering death, and the pain of death is overcome through Him.
He ensures the resurrection of the dead, meaning that everyone will be raised to stand before His judgment.
Through Him, the world is redeemed, so that those who are innocent when they stand before Him on judgment day will be permitted to live in God's presence in His kingdom, singing endless praise alongside the heavenly choirs to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who are one God, in an eternal state of happiness.
So, repent and be baptized in Jesus' name, and embrace the gospel of Christ, which will be presented to you not only in this record but also in the record that will come to the Gentiles from the Jews, and that will eventually come from the Gentiles to you.
This is written so that you may come to believe; and if you believe that, you will also believe this; and if you believe this, you will learn about your ancestors and the amazing things that God did among them.
You will also come to understand that you are part of Jacob’s seed; therefore, you belong to those who hold the first covenant; and if you believe in Christ and are baptized—first with water, then with fire and the Holy Spirit, following the example of our Savior and His commands—it will go well for you on judgment day. Amen.
