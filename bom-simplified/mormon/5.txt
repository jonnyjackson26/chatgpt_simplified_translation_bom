I went among the Nephites and regretted the promise I made not to help them anymore; they put me back in charge of their armies because they believed I could save them from their troubles.
However, I felt hopeless because I understood the Lord's judgments that were coming upon them. They did not repent of their wrongdoings, and instead, they fought for their lives without turning to the God who created them.
The Lamanites attacked us again while we were trying to escape to the city of Jordan, but they were pushed back and didn't capture the city at that time.
They returned to battle again, and we managed to hold the city. Other cities were also defended by the Nephites, which blocked the Lamanites from entering our territory to harm the people living there.
But any land we passed by where the people did not gather together was destroyed by the Lamanites; their towns, villages, and cities were burned down, and thus three hundred and seventy-nine years went by.
Then, in the three hundred and eightieth year, the Lamanites attacked us again, and we stood firm against them, but it was hopeless since their numbers were so great that they trampled over the Nephite people.
We had to flee once more, and those who could run faster than the Lamanites escaped, while those who couldn’t were caught and killed.
Now, I, Mormon, do not want to distress anyone by describing the horrific scenes of bloodshed I witnessed; however, since these events must be shared and everything hidden must be revealed from the rooftops—
I also know that the survivors of this people, as well as the Gentiles who care about Israel, must understand where their blessings come from.
For I know these people will grieve for Israel’s misfortunes; yes, they will mourn for this people's destruction and regret that they did not repent so they could embrace Jesus.
These writings are meant for the remnant of the house of Jacob; they are written this way because God knows that wickedness will not lead them to truth, and they will be kept safe until His timing.
This is the command I received: they will come forth as the Lord commands when it is His wise decision.
They will be sent to the unbelieving Jews with the purpose of convincing them that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, so that the Father can fulfill His great eternal plan to restore the Jews, or all of Israel, to the land He has promised them as part of His covenant.
Also, the descendants of this people will be encouraged to believe in the gospel that will be shared with them by the Gentiles; this people will be scattered and will become dark, filthy, and despicable, more than any described among us, even worse than the Lamanites, due to their lack of faith and idol worship.
For the Spirit of the Lord has already stopped striving with their ancestors, and they are lost without Christ and God in their lives, tossed about like chaff in the wind.
They used to be a joyful people with Christ as their shepherd, led by God the Father.
But now they are led by Satan, just like chaff is swept away in the wind, or like a ship tossed on the waves, without sail or anchor, unable to steer; they are just like that ship.
The Lord has held back the blessings they could have received in that land for the Gentiles who will take possession of it.
But it will happen that they will be driven and scattered by the Gentiles; after they have been scattered, the Lord will remember the covenant He made with Abraham and all of Israel.
The Lord will also remember the prayers of the righteous that have been offered for them.
Then, O Gentiles, how can you stand before God’s power if you do not repent and abandon your wrong ways?
Do you not realize that you are in God's hands? Do you not understand that He has all power, and at His command, the earth will be rolled up like a scroll?
Therefore, repent and humble yourselves before Him, or He will come against you justly—like a remnant of Jacob’s descendants that will rise up like a lion and tear you apart with no one to save you.
