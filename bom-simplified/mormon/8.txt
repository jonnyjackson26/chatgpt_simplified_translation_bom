I, Moroni, am finishing the record of my father, Mormon. I have only a few things left to write, which my father commanded me to do.
After the huge and terrible battle at Cumorah, the Nephites who escaped to the south were pursued by the Lamanites until they were all wiped out.
My father was also killed by them, and now I am left alone to tell the tragic story of my people's destruction. But they are gone, and I must follow my father’s command. I do not know if they will kill me.
So, I will write and bury the records in the ground; where I go doesn’t matter.
My father created this record and wrote its purpose. I would write more if there was space on the plates, but there's not, and I have no metal to write on because I'm alone. My father was killed in battle, and all my relatives are gone, and I have no friends or place to go; I don’t know how much longer the Lord will allow me to live.
Four hundred years have passed since the arrival of our Lord and Savior.
The Lamanites have chased my people, the Nephites, from city to city until they no longer exist; their fall has been great, and the destruction of my people is both significant and astonishing.
It is the Lord who has caused this. The Lamanites are also fighting among themselves, and this entire land is filled with ongoing murder and bloodshed; no one knows when the fighting will end.
Now, I will say no more about them; only the Lamanites and robbers are left in the land.
Only the disciples of Jesus know the true God; they stayed in the land until the people's wickedness became so severe that the Lord would not allow them remain; no one knows if they still live on the earth.
Yet, my father and I have seen them, and they have helped us.
Whoever receives this record and does not condemn it for its flaws will learn about even greater things. I am Moroni; if I could, I would reveal everything to you.
I will stop talking about this people. I am Mormon's son, and my father was a descendant of Nephi.
I am the one who hides this record before the Lord; the plates themselves are not valuable because the Lord commanded it. He says that no one should use them for personal gain; however, the record is very important, and whoever brings it to light will be blessed by the Lord.
No one can reveal it unless God gives them that power; for God desires that it happen with the intention of glorifying Him and for the benefit of His dispersed covenant people.
Blessed is the one who brings this to light; it will emerge from darkness into light, as God has promised; it will come out of the earth, shine brightly, and be recognized by the people; and this will be accomplished by God's power.
If there are mistakes, they belong to a human. But we claim no faults; God knows everything; therefore, those who judge should be cautious, lest they risk severe consequences.
And those who demand signs—be careful, as they might compel what the Lord has forbidden.
For anyone who judges impulsively will be judged in the same way; their actions will determine their consequences; so, those who harm will themselves be harmed by the Lord.
Listen to what the scriptures say—people should not harm others or judge; because judgment is the Lord's, and He will repay.
Anyone who speaks angrily against the work of the Lord, or against His covenant people, the house of Israel, and declares that they will destroy the Lord's work, thinking He will forget His covenant to Israel, is in serious danger of being destroyed.
For the eternal plans of the Lord will continue until all His promises are fulfilled.
Look into the prophecies of Isaiah. I cannot write them all. The saints who came before me and lived in this land will speak from beyond the grave; as surely as the Lord lives, He will remember the covenant He made with them.
He knows their prayers for their siblings. He knows their faith, as they could move mountains in His name; and by His command, they could make prisons collapse; not even fiery furnaces, wild animals, or poisonous snakes could harm them because of His power.
Their prayers also included asking the Lord to allow the bringing forth of these records.
No one can claim they won’t come forth, because they will; for the Lord has declared it; they will emerge from the earth through God's hand, and nothing can stop this; and it will happen at a time when people say miracles no longer happen; it will be like someone is speaking from beyond the dead.
It will come at a time when the blood of saints cries to the Lord because of secret plots and evil deeds.
Yes, it will be a time when the power of God is denied, and churches become corrupted and proud; even a time when church leaders become proud and envy those who belong to their faith.
Yes, it will happen during a time of fires, storms, and smoke in distant places.
There will be wars, rumors of war, and earthquakes in various locations.
Yes, it will be a time filled with pollution across the earth; there will be murders, theft, lies, deception, sexual immorality, and all kinds of wickedness; many will say, "Do this or that," and think it doesn’t matter because the Lord will eventually uphold them. But woe to them, for they are trapped in bitterness and sin.
Yes, it will be a time when churches will arise saying, "Come to me, and I will forgive you your sins for money."
Oh, you wicked and stubborn people, why have you built churches for profit? Why have you twisted the holy word of God to condemn your own souls? Behold, pay attention to God's revelations; the time is coming when all these things must happen.
The Lord has shown me remarkable things about what will soon come, at that day when these things will be revealed to you.
I speak to you as if you were right here, yet you are not. But Jesus Christ has shown you to me, and I know what you are doing.
I see that you walk in pride; only a few of you humble yourselves instead of flaunting lavish clothing, envying others, and engaging in conflicts, hatred, and all sorts of wrongdoing; your churches, every single one, have become tainted by your pride.
For you love money, your possessions, your fancy clothing, and the beauty of your churches more than you care for the poor, the needy, the sick, and the hurting.
Oh, you hypocrites, you teachers who sell yourselves for fleeting gain, why have you stained God's holy church? Why are you embarrassed to take Christ's name upon you? Why can’t you see that eternal happiness is far more valuable than a temporary misery brought on by seeking the world's approval?
Why do you adorn yourselves with lifeless things, while ignoring the hungry, the needy, the naked, the sick, and the afflicted as they pass by you without recognition?
Yes, why do you build up your hidden sins for profit, causing widows to grieve before the Lord, orphans to weep before the Lord, while the blood of fathers and husbands cries out to the Lord from the ground for revenge?
The sword of vengeance is poised above you, and the time will soon come when the Lord will exact retribution for the blood of the saints upon you, for He will no longer tolerate their cries.
