I am concluding my record about the destruction of my people, the Nephites. We advanced towards the Lamanites.
I, Mormon, wrote a letter to the Lamanite king, asking him to allow us to bring our people to the hill called Cumorah, so we could prepare for battle there.
The Lamanite king agreed to my request.
We marched to the land of Cumorah and set up our tents around the hill; this area was filled with rivers and springs, and we hoped to gain an advantage against the Lamanites.
After three hundred eighty-four years, we gathered all our remaining people to the land of Cumorah.
When we gathered all our people there, I, Mormon, began to feel old. Realizing this would be our final struggle and knowing that I must protect the sacred records from falling into the hands of the Lamanites (who would destroy them), I created this record from the plates of Nephi and buried all other sacred records given to me by the Lord in the hill Cumorah, except for a few plates I gave to my son Moroni.
As my people, along with their families, saw the Lamanite armies approaching, they were filled with the deep fear of death that plagues the wicked.
The Lamanites charged at us, and our hearts were gripped with terror at their overwhelming numbers.
They attacked my people with swords, bows, arrows, axes, and every kind of weapon.
My men were killed, including the ten thousand who fought with me, and I was wounded during the battle but left alive.
After they had slain all my people except for twenty-four of us (including my son Moroni), we survived the massacre and the next day, while looking from the top of the hill Cumorah, we saw the ten thousand of my people who had fallen, with me leading them.
We also saw the ten thousand led by my son Moroni.
And we saw that Gidgiddonah and his ten thousand had also fallen, along with him.
Lamah and his ten thousand fell, as did Gilgal, Limhah, Jeneum, Cumenihah, Moronihah, Antionum, Shiblom, Shem, and Josh, with their ten thousand each.
Moreover, ten others also fell in battle, each with ten thousand; truly all my people were lost except those twenty-four with me, and a few who escaped south or deserted to the Lamanites; their remains lay on the ground, left by those who killed them to decay and return to the earth.
My heart ached with sorrow for my fallen people, and I cried out:
O beautiful ones, how could you turn away from the Lord! O beautiful ones, how could you reject Jesus, who wanted to welcome you with open arms!
If you had not done this, you wouldn’t have fallen. But now you have fallen, and I mourn your loss.
O lovely sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, how could you have fallen!
But now you are gone, and my grief cannot bring you back.
The day will come when your mortal bodies must become immortal, and these decaying bodies will turn into incorruptible ones; then you will stand before Christ’s judgment seat to be judged for your actions; if you are righteous, you will be blessed alongside your righteous ancestors.
O that you had repented before this great destruction occurred! But now you are gone, and the Heavenly Father knows your situation, and He treats you according to His justice and mercy.
